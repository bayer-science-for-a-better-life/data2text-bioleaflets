QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nTrulicity 0.75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 0.75 mg of dulaglutide* in 0.5 ml solution. \n \nTrulicity 1.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n  \nEach pre-filled pen contains 1.5 mg of dulaglutide* in 0.5 ml solution. \n \nTrulicity 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n  \nEach pre-filled pen contains 3 mg of dulaglutide* in 0.5 ml solution. \n \nTrulicity 4.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n  \nEach pre-filled pen contains 4.5 mg of dulaglutide* in 0.5 ml solution. \n \n*produced in CHO cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection.  \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nTrulicity is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus \nas an adjunct to diet and exercise \n• as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or \n\ncontraindications \n• in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  \n \nFor study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, \nand the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nMonotherapy  \nThe recommended dose is 0.75 mg once weekly. \n \nAdd-on therapy \nThe recommended dose is 1.5 mg once weekly. \n \nFor potentially vulnerable populations 0.75 mg once weekly can be considered as a starting dose.  \n \nFor additional glycaemic control,  \n• the 1.5 mg dose may be increased after at least 4 weeks to 3 mg once weekly. \n• the 3 mg dose may be increased after at least 4 weeks to 4.5 mg once weekly. \nThe maximum dose is 4.5 mg once weekly.  \n \nWhen Trulicity is added to existing metformin and/or pioglitazone therapy, the current dose of \nmetformin and/or pioglitazone can be continued. When Trulicity is added to existing metformin \nand/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy, the current dose of metformin \nand/or SGLT2i can be continued. When it is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea or insulin, a \nreduction in the dose of sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe use of Trulicity does not require blood glucose self-monitoring. Blood glucose self-monitoring is \nnecessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea or insulin, particularly when Trulicity therapy is started \nand insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin dose reduction is recommended. \n \nMissed doses \nIf a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible if there are at least 3 days (72 hours) \nuntil the next scheduled dose. If less than 3 days (72 hours) remain before the next scheduled dose, \nthe missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be administered on the regularly \nscheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule. \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR \n< 90 to ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73m2). \n \nThere is very limited experience in patients with end stage renal disease (< 15 ml/min/1.73m2), \ntherefore Trulicity cannot be recommended in this population (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of dulaglutide in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nTrulicity is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. It should not be \nadministered intravenously or intramuscularly. \n \nThe dose can be administered at any time of day, with or without meals.  \n \nThe day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary, as long as the last dose was \nadministered 3 or more days (72 hours) before. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. \n \nType 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis \n \nDulaglutide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of \ndiabetic ketoacidosis. Dulaglutide is not a substitute for insulin.  \n \nDiabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in insulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or \ndose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). \n \nSevere gastrointestinal disease \n \nDulaglutide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe \ngastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients. \n \nDehydration \n \nDehydration, sometimes leading to acute renal failure or worsening renal impairment, has been \nreported in patients treated with dulaglutide, especially at the initiation of treatment. Many of the \nreported adverse renal events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nor dehydration. Patients treated with dulaglutide should be advised of the potential risk of \ndehydration, particularly in relation to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid \nfluid depletion. \n \nAcute pancreatitis \n \nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In \nclinical trials, acute pancreatitis has been reported in association with dulaglutide (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is \nsuspected, dulaglutide should be discontinued. If pancreatitis is confirmed, dulaglutide should not be \nrestarted. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic \nenzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis (see section 4.8). \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nHypoglycaemia \n \nPatients receiving dulaglutide in combination with sulphonylurea or insulin may have an increased \nrisk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of \nsulphonylurea or insulin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium- free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDulaglutide delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the rate of absorption of \nconcomitantly administered oral medicinal products. In the clinical pharmacology studies described \nbelow, dulaglutide doses up to 1.5 mg did not affect the absorption of the orally administered \nmedicinal products tested to any clinically relevant degree. For the 4.5 mg dose, absence of major \nclinically relevant interactions was predicted by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) \nmodelling simulations. \n \nFor patients receiving dulaglutide in combination with oral medicinal products with rapid \ngastrointestinal absorption or prolonged release, there is a potential for altered medicinal product \nexposure, particularly at the time of dulaglutide treatment initiation.   \n  \nSitagliptin \n \nSitagliptin exposure was unaffected when coadministered with a single 1.5 mg dose of dulaglutide. \nFollowing coadministration with 2 consecutive 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide, sitagliptin AUC(0-τ) and \nCmax decreased by approximately 7.4 % and 23.1 %, respectively. Sitagliptin tmax increased \napproximately 0.5 hours following coadministration with dulaglutide compared to sitagliptin alone. \n \nSitagliptin can produce up to 80 % inhibition of DPP-4 over a 24-hour period. Dulaglutide (1.5 mg) \ncoadministration with sitagliptin increased dulaglutide exposure and Cmax by approximately 38 % and \n27 %, respectively, and median tmax increased approximately 24 hours. Therefore, dulaglutide does \nhave a high degree of protection against DPP-4 inactivation (see section 5.1, Mechanism of action). \nThe increased exposure may enhance the effects of dulaglutide on blood glucose levels. \n \nParacetamol \n \nFollowing a first dose of 1 and 3 mg dulaglutide, paracetamol Cmax was reduced by 36 % and 50 %, \nrespectively, and the median tmax occurred later (3 and 4 hours, respectively). After coadministration \nwith up to 3 mg of dulaglutide at steady state, there were no statistically significant differences on \nAUC(0-12), Cmax or tmax of paracetamol. No dose adjustment of paracetamol is necessary when \nadministered with dulaglutide. \n \nAtorvastatin \n \nCoadministration of 1.5 mg of dulaglutide with atorvastatin decreased Cmax and AUC(0-∞) up to 70 % \nand 21 %, respectively, for atorvastatin and its major metabolite o-hydroxyatorvastatin. The mean t1/2 \nof atorvastatin and o-hydroxyatorvastatin were increased by 17 % and 41 %, respectively, following \ndulaglutide administration. These observations are not clinically relevant. No dose adjustment of \natorvastatin is necessary when administered with dulaglutide. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nDigoxin  \n \nAfter coadministration of steady state digoxin with 2 consecutive 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide, overall \nexposure (AUCτ) and tmax of digoxin were unchanged; and Cmax decreased by up to 22 %. This change \nis not expected to have clinical consequences. No dose adjustment is required for digoxin when \nadministered with dulaglutide. \n \nAnti-hypertensives \n \nCoadministration of multiple dulaglutide 1.5 mg doses with steady state lisinopril caused no clinically \nrelevant changes in the AUC or Cmax of lisinopril. Statistically significant delays in lisinopril tmax of \napproximately 1 hour were observed on Days 3 and 24 of the study. When a single 1.5 mg dose of \ndulaglutide and metoprolol were coadministered, the AUC and Cmax of metoprolol increased by19 % \nand 32 %, respectively. While metoprolol tmax was delayed by 1 hour, this change was not statistically \nsignificant. These changes were not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of lisinopril or \nmetoprolol is necessary when administered with dulaglutide. \n \nWarfarin  \n \nFollowing dulaglutide (1.5 mg) coadministration, S- and R-warfarin exposure and R-warfarin Cmax \n\nwere unaffected, and S-warfarin Cmax decreased by 22 %. AUCINR increased by 2 %, which is unlikely \nto be clinically significant, and there was no effect on maximum international normalised ratio \nresponse (INRmax). The time of international normalised ratio response (tINRmax) was delayed by \n6 hours, consistent with delays in tmax of approximately 4 and 6 hours for S- and R-warfarin, \nrespectively. These changes are not clinically relevant. No dose adjustment for warfarin is necessary \nwhen given together with dulaglutide. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nCoadministration of dulaglutide (1.5 mg) with an oral contraceptive (norgestimate 0.18 mg/ethinyl \nestradiol 0.025 mg) did not affect the overall exposure to norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol. \nStatistically significant reductions in Cmax of 26 % and 13 % and delays in tmax of 2 and 0.30 hours \nwere observed for norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol, respectively. These observations are not \nclinically relevant. No dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is required when given together with \ndulaglutide. \n \nMetformin \n \nFollowing coadministration of multiple 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide with steady state metformin \n(immediate release formula [IR]), metformin AUCτ increased up to 15 % and Cmax decreased up to \n12 %, respectively, with no changes in tmax. These changes are consistent with the gastric emptying \ndelay of dulaglutide and within the pharmacokinetic variability of metformin and thus are not \nclinically relevant. No dose adjustment for metformin IR is recommended when given with \ndulaglutide. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of dulaglutide in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Therefore, the use of dulaglutide is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether dulaglutide is excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. Dulaglutide should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of dulaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. In the rat, there was no direct effect on \nmating or fertility following treatment with dulaglutide (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTrulicity has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When it is used in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid \nhypoglycaemia while driving and using machines (see section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nIn the completed phase 2 and phase 3 studies to support the initial registration of dulaglutide 0.75 mg \nand 1.5 mg, 4,006 patients were exposed to dulaglutide alone or in combination with other glucose \nlowering medicinal products. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were \ngastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In general, these reactions were mild or \nmoderate in severity and transient in nature. Results from the long-term cardiovascular outcome study \nwith 4,949 patients randomised to dulaglutide and followed for a median of 5.4 years were consistent \nwith these findings. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified based on evaluation of the full duration of the \nphase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies, the long-term cardiovascular outcome study and post-marketing \nreports. The adverse reactions are listed in Table 1 as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class \nand in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: < 1/10,000 and not known: cannot be \nestimated from available data). Within each incidence grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing frequency. Frequencies for events have been calculated based on their incidence \nin the phase 2 and phase 3 registration studies. \n \nTable 1.

For dulaglutide 0.75 mg, adverse reaction met frequency for next \nlower incidence grouping. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHypoglycaemia \nWhen dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg were used as monotherapy or in combination with metformin \nalone or metformin and pioglitazone, the incidences of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia were \n5.9 % to 10.9 % and the rates were 0.14 to 0.62 events/patient/year, and no episodes of severe \nhypoglycaemia were reported. \n \nThe incidences of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia when dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, \nrespectively, were used in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin were 39.0 % and 40.3 % \nand the rates were 1.67 and 1.67 events/patient/year. The severe hypoglycaemia event incidences \nwere 0 % and 0.7 %, and rates were 0.00 and 0.01 events/patient/year for each dose, respectively. The \nincidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia when dulaglutide 1.5 mg was used with \nsulphonylurea alone was 11.3 % and the rate was 0.90 events/patient/year, and there were no episodes \nof severe hypoglycaemia. \n \nThe incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia when dulaglutide 1.5 mg was used in \ncombination with insulin glargine was 35.3 % and the rate was 3.38 events/patient/year. The severe \nhypoglycaemia event incidence was 0.7 % and the rate was 0.01 events/patient/year. \n \nThe incidences when dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively, were used in combination with \nprandial insulin were 85.3 % and 80.0 % and rates were 35.66 and 31.06 events/patient/year. The \nsevere hypoglycaemia event incidences were 2.4 % and 3.4 %, and rates were 0.05 and \n0.06 events/patient/year. \n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, \ndiarrhoea, \nvomiting†, \nabdominal pain† \n\nDecreased \nappetite, \ndyspepsia, \nconstipation, \nflatulence, \nabdominal \ndistention, \ngastroesophageal \nreflux disease, \neructation \n\n Acute \npancreatitis \n\nNon-\nmechanical \nintestinal \nobstruction \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Cholelithiasis, \ncholecystitis \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n   Angioedema#  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fatigue Injection site \nreactions \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Sinus \ntachycardia, first \ndegree \natrioventricular \nblock (AVB) \n\n   \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn a phase 3 study through to week 52, when dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg were used in \ncombination with metformin, the incidences of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia were 3.1 %, \n2.4 % and 3.1 %, respectively, and rates were 0.07, 0.05 and 0.07 events/patient/year; one episode of \nsevere hypoglycaemia was reported with dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 4.5 mg, respectively. \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \nCumulative reporting of gastrointestinal events up to 104 weeks with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, \nrespectively, included nausea (12.9 % and 21.2 %), diarrhoea (10.7 % and 13.7 %) and vomiting \n(6.9 % and 11.5 %). These were typically mild or moderate in severity and were reported to peak \nduring the first 2 weeks of treatment and rapidly declined over the next 4 weeks, after which the rate \nremained relatively constant.  \n \nIn a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses respectively, cumulative reporting \nof gastrointestinal events through to 52 weeks included nausea (14.2 %, 16.1 % and 17.3 %), \ndiarrhoea (7.7 %, 12.0 % and 11.6 %) and vomiting (6.4 %, 9.1 % and 10.1 %). In clinical \npharmacology studies conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus up to 6 weeks, the majority \nof gastrointestinal events were reported during the first 2-3 days after the initial dose and declined \nwith subsequent doses. \n \nAcute pancreatitis  \nThe incidence of acute pancreatitis in phase 2 and 3 registration studies was 0.07 % for dulaglutide \ncompared to 0.14 % for placebo and 0.19 % for comparators with or without additional background \nantidiabetic therapy. \n \nPancreatic enzymes \nDulaglutide is associated with mean increases from baseline in pancreatic enzymes (lipase and/or \npancreatic amylase) of 11 % to 21 % (see section 4.4). In the absence of other signs and symptoms of \nacute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis. \n \nHeart rate increase  \nSmall mean increases in heart rate of 2 to 4 beats per minute (bpm) and a 1.3 % and 1.4 % incidence \nof sinus tachycardia, with a concomitant increase from baseline ≥ 15 bpm, were observed with \ndulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively.  \n \nIn a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of sinus \ntachycardia, with a concomitant increase from baseline ≥ 15 bpm, was 2.6 %, 1.9 % and 2.6 % \nrespectively. Mean increases in heart rate of 1 – 4 beats per minute (bpm) were observed. \n \nFirst degree AV block/PR interval prolongation  \nSmall mean increases from baseline in PR interval of 2 to 3 msec and a 1.5 % and 2.4 % incidence of \nfirst-degree AV block were observed with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively. \n \nIn a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of first-degree AV \nblock was 1.2 %, 3.8 % and 1.7 % respectively. Mean increases from baseline in PR interval of \n3 – 5 msec were observed.  \n \nImmunogenicity  \nIn registration studies, treatment with dulaglutide was associated with a 1.6 % incidence of treatment \nemergent dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies, indicating that the structural modifications in the GLP-1 \nand modified IgG4 parts of the dulaglutide molecule, together with high homology with native GLP-1 \nand native IgG4, minimise the risk of immune response against dulaglutide. Patients with dulaglutide \nanti-drug antibodies generally had low titres, and although the number of patients developing \ndulaglutide anti-drug antibodies was low, examination of the phase 3 data revealed no clear impact of \ndulaglutide anti-drug antibodies on changes in HbA1c. None of the patients with systemic \nhypersensitivity developed dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nHypersensitivity  \nIn the phase 2 and phase 3 registration studies, systemic hypersensitivity events (e.g., urticaria, \nedema) were reported in 0.5 % of patients receiving dulaglutide. Cases of anaphylactic reaction have \nbeen rarely reported with marketed use of dulaglutide.  \n \nInjection site reactions  \nInjection site adverse events were reported in 1.9 % of patients receiving dulaglutide. Potentially \nimmune-mediated injection site adverse events (e.g., rash, erythema) were reported in 0.7 % of \npatients and were usually mild. \n \nDiscontinuation due to an adverse event \nIn studies of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 2.6 % \n(0.75 mg) and 6.1 % (1.5 mg) for dulaglutide versus 3.7 % for placebo. Through the full study \nduration (up to 104 weeks), the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 5.1 % \n(0.75 mg) and 8.4 % (1.5 mg) for dulaglutide. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to \ndiscontinuation for 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg dulaglutide, respectively, were nausea (1.0 %, 1.9 %), \ndiarrhoea (0.5 %, 0.6 %), and vomiting (0.4 %, 0.6 %), and were generally reported within the first \n4 - 6 weeks.  \n \nIn a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of discontinuation \ndue to adverse events through 52 weeks was 6.0 % (1.5 mg), 7.0 % (3 mg) and 8.5 % (4.5 mg). The \nmost frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg, \nrespectively, were nausea (1.3 %, 1.3 %, 1.5 %), diarrhoea (0.2 %, 1.0 %, 1.0 %), and vomiting \n(0.0 %, 0.8 %, 1.3 %). \n \nDulaglutide doses of 3 mg and 4.5 mg  \nThe safety profile in patients treated with dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg once weekly is consistent with \nthat described above for dulaglutide doses of 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nEffects of overdose with dulaglutide in clinical studies have included gastrointestinal disorders and \nhypoglycaemia. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated \naccording to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins, \nATC code: A10BJ05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDulaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. The molecule consists \nof 2 identical disulfide-linked chains, each containing a modified human GLP-1 analogue sequence \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\ncovalently linked to a modified human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) heavy chain fragment (Fc) by a \nsmall peptide linker. The GLP-1 analog portion of dulaglutide is approximately 90 % homologous to \nnative human GLP-1 (7-37). Native GLP-1 has a half-life of 1.5 - 2 minutes due to degradation by \nDPP-4 and renal clearance. In contrast to native GLP-1, dulaglutide is resistant to degradation by \nDPP-4, and has a large size that slows absorption and reduces renal clearance. These engineering \nfeatures result in a soluble formulation and a prolonged half-life of 4.7 days, which makes it suitable \nfor once-weekly subcutaneous administration. In addition, the dulaglutide molecule was engineered to \nprevent the Fcγ receptor-dependent immune response and to reduce its immunogenic potential. \n \nDulaglutide exhibits several antihyperglycaemic actions of GLP-1. In the presence of elevated glucose \nconcentrations, dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in pancreatic beta cells leading \nto insulin release. Dulaglutide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately \nelevated in patients with type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic \nglucose output. Dulaglutide also slows gastric emptying. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDulaglutide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering fasting, pre-meal \nand postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes starting after the first \ndulaglutide administration and is sustained throughout the once weekly dosing interval. \n \nA pharmacodynamic study with dulaglutide demonstrated, in patients with type 2 diabetes, a \nrestoration of first phase insulin secretion to a level that exceeded levels observed in healthy subjects \non placebo and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to an intravenous bolus of \nglucose. In the same study, a single 1.5 mg dose of dulaglutide appeared to increase maximal insulin \nsecretion from the β-cells, and to enhance β-cell function in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus as \ncompared with placebo. \n \nConsistent with the pharmacokinetic profile, dulaglutide has a pharmacodynamic profile suitable for \nonce weekly administration (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nGlycaemic control \nThe safety and efficacy of dulaglutide were evaluated in ten randomised, controlled, phase 3 trials \ninvolving 8,035 patients with type 2 diabetes. Of these, 1,644 were ≥ 65 years of which 174 were \n≥ 75 years. These studies included 5,650 dulaglutide treated patients, of whom 1,558 were treated \nwith Trulicity 0.75 mg weekly, 2,862 were treated with Trulicity 1.5 mg weekly, 616 were treated \nwith Trulicity 3 mg weekly and 614 were treated with Trulicity 4.5 mg weekly. In all studies, \ndulaglutide produced clinically significant improvements in glycaemic control as measured by \nglycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).  \n \nMonotherapy \nDulaglutide was studied in a 52-week active controlled monotherapy study in comparison to \nmetformin. Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were superior to metformin (1500 - 2000 mg/day) in the \nreduction in HbA1c and a significantly greater proportion of patients reached an HbA1c target of \n< 7.0 % and ≤ 6.5 % with Trulicity 1.5 mg and Trulicity 0.75 mg compared to metformin at 26 weeks.  \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 2.

Ten patients \nreported severe hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, seven with dulaglutide 0.75 mg, and fifteen \nwith insulin glargine. \n \nFasting blood glucose \nTreatment with dulaglutide resulted in significant reductions from baseline in fasting blood glucose. \nThe majority of the effect on fasting blood glucose concentrations occurred by 2 weeks. The \nimprovement in fasting glucose was sustained through the longest study duration of 104 weeks. \n \nPostprandial glucose \nTreatment with dulaglutide resulted in significant reductions in mean post prandial glucose from \nbaseline (changes from baseline to primary time point -1.95 mmol/L to -4.23 mmol/L). \n \nBeta-cell function \nClinical studies with dulaglutide have indicated enhanced beta-cell function as measured by \nhomeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-%B). The durability of effect on beta-cell function was \nmaintained through the longest study duration of 104 weeks. \n \nBody weight \nTrulicity 1.5 mg was associated with sustained weight reduction over the duration of studies (from \nbaseline to final time point -0.35 kg to -2.90 kg). Changes in body weight with Trulicity 0.75 mg \n\n\n\n20 \n\nranged from 0.86 kg to -2.63 kg. Reduction in body weight was observed in patients treated with \ndulaglutide irrespective of nausea, though the reduction was numerically larger in the group with \nnausea. \n \nPatient reported outcomes \nDulaglutide significantly improved total treatment satisfaction compared to exenatide twice daily. In \naddition, there was significantly lower perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia \ncompared to exenatide twice daily. \n \nBlood pressure \nThe effect of dulaglutide on blood pressure as assessed by Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring \nwas evaluated in a study of 755 patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with dulaglutide provided \nreductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-2.8 mmHg difference compared to placebo) at 16 weeks. \nThere was no difference in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Similar results for SBP and DBP were \ndemonstrated at the final 26 week time point of the study. \n \nCardiovascular Evaluation \n \nMeta-analysis of phase 2 and 3 studies \nIn a meta-analysis of phase 2 and 3 registration studies, a total of 51 patients (dulaglutide: \n26 [N = 3,885]; all comparators: 25 [N = 2,125]) experienced at least one cardiovascular (CV) event \n(death due to CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina). The \nresults showed that there was no increase in CV risk with dulaglutide compared with control therapies \n(HR: 0.57; CI: [0.30, 1.10]). \n \nCardiovascular outcome study \nThe Trulicity long-term cardiovascular outcome study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical \ntrial. Type 2 diabetes patients were randomly allocated to either Trulicity 1.5 mg (4,949) or placebo \n(4,952) both in addition to standards of care for type 2 diabetes (the 0.75 mg dose was not \nadministered in this study). The median study follow-up time was 5.4 years.  \n \nThe mean age was 66.2 years, the mean BMI was 32.3 kg/m², and 46.3 % of patients were female. \nThere were 3,114 (31.5 %) patients with established CV disease. The median baseline HbA1c was \n7.2 %. The Trulicity treatment arm included patients ≥ 65 years (n = 2,619) and ≥ 75 years (n = 484), \nand patients with mild (n = 2,435), moderate (n = 1,031) or severe (n = 50) renal impairment.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of any major adverse \ncardiovascular events (MACE): CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. \nTrulicity was superior in preventing MACE compared to placebo (Figure 1). Each MACE component \ncontributed to the reduction of MACE, as shown in Figure 2. \n \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n \nFigure 1.

Forest plot of analyses of individual cardiovascular event types, all cause death, and \nconsistency of effect across subgroups for the primary endpoint  \n \nA significant and sustained reduction in HbA1c levels from baseline to month 60 was observed with \nTrulicity vs placebo, in addition to standard of care (-0.29 % vs 0.22 %; estimated treatment \ndifference -0.51 % [-0.57; -0.45]; p < 0.001). There were significantly fewer patients in the Trulicity \ngroup who received an additional glycaemic intervention compared to placebo (Trulicity: 2,086 \n[42.2 %]; placebo: 2,825 [57.0 %]; p < 0.001). \n \nCombination of dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 3 mg and 1.5 mg therapy with metformin \nThe safety and efficacy of dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg once weekly compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg \nonce weekly as add-on to metformin were investigated in a 52 weeks study. At 36 weeks, both \nTrulicity 3 mg and 4.5 mg were superior to Trulicity 1.5 mg in lowering of HbA1c and body weight. \n\n\n\n23 \n\nA greater percentage of patients achieved HbA1c targets of < 7.0 % or ≤ 6.5 % at 36 weeks with \nTrulicity 3 mg and Trulicity 4.5 mg. The proportions of patients that achieved ≥ 5 % body weight \nreduction from baseline were 31 %, 40 % and 49 % for Trulicity 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg \nrespectively.

No \npatients reported cases of severe hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, six with dulaglutide \n0.75 mg, and seventeen with insulin glargine. The safety profile of dulaglutide in patients with renal \nimpairment was similar to that observed in other studies with dulaglutide. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTrulicity in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of type 2 diabetes \nmellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration to patients with type 2 diabetes, dulaglutide reaches peak \nplasma concentrations in 48 hours. The mean peak (Cmax) and total (AUC) exposures were \napproximately 114 ng/ml and 14,000 ngh/ml, respectively, after multiple subcutaneous 1.5 mg doses \nof dulaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved \nbetween 2 to 4 weeks of once-weekly administration of dulaglutide (1.5 mg). Exposures after \nsubcutaneous administration of single dulaglutide (1.5 mg) doses in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm \nwere comparable. The mean absolute bioavailability of dulaglutide following single-dose \nsubcutaneous administration of single 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg doses was 47 % and 65 %, respectively. \n\n\n\n26 \n\nAbsolute bioavailabilities for 3 mg and 4.5 mg doses were estimated to be similar to 1.5 mg although \nthey have not been specifically studied. Over the dose range 0.75 mg to 4.5 mg, the increase in \ndulaglutide concentration is approximately proportional. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent population mean central volume of distribution was 3.09 L and the apparent population \nmean peripheral volume of distribution was 5.98 L. \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nDulaglutide is presumed to be degraded into its component amino acids by general protein catabolism \npathways. \n \nElimination \n \nApparent population mean clearance of dulaglutide was 0.142 L/h. and the elimination half-life was \napproximately 5 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nAge had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of \ndulaglutide. \n \nGender and race \nGender and race had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide. \n \nBody weight or body mass index \nPharmacokinetic analyses have demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship between \nbody weight or body mass index (BMI) and dulaglutide exposure, although there was no clinically \nrelevant impact of weight or BMI on glycaemic control. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide were evaluated in a clinical pharmacology study and were \ngenerally similar between healthy subjects and patients with mild to severe renal impairment \n(CrCl < 30 ml/min), including end stage renal disease (requiring dialysis). Additionally, in a 52 week \nclinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR [by \nCKD-EPI] < 60 and ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), the pharmacokinetic profile of Trulicity 0.75 mg and \n1.5 mg once weekly was similar to that demonstrated in previous clinical studies. This clinical study \ndid not include patients with end stage renal disease. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide were evaluated in a clinical pharmacology study, where subjects \nwith hepatic impairment had statistically significant decreases in dulaglutide exposure of up to 30 % \nto 33 % for mean Cmax and AUC, respectively, compared to healthy controls. There was a general \nincrease in tmax of dulaglutide with increased hepatic impairment. However, no trend in dulaglutide \nexposure was observed relative to the degree of hepatic impairment. These effects were not \nconsidered to be clinically relevant. \n \nPaediatric population \nStudies characterising the pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide in paediatric patients have not been \nperformed. \n \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology or repeat-dose toxicity. \n \nIn a 6 month carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice, there was no tumorigenic response. In a 2 year \ncarcinogenicity study in rats, at ≥ 3 times the human clinical exposure following 4.5 mg dulaglutide \nper week, dulaglutide caused statistically significant, dose-related increases in the incidence of thyroid \nC-cell tumours (adenomas and carcinomas combined). The clinical relevance of these findings is \ncurrently unknown.  \n \nDuring the fertility studies, a reduction in the number of corpora lutea and prolonged oestrous cycle \nwere observed at dose levels that were associated with decreased food intake and body weight gain in \nmaternal animals; however, no effects on indices of fertility and conception or embryonic \ndevelopment were observed. In reproductive toxicology studies, skeletal effects and a reduction in \nfoetal growth were observed in the rat and rabbit at exposures of dulaglutide 5- to 18-fold higher than \nthose proposed clinically, but no foetal malformations were observed. Treatment of rats throughout \npregnancy and lactation produced memory deficits in female offspring at exposures that were 7-fold \nhigher than those proposed clinically.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection.  \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nTrulicity is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus \nas an adjunct to diet and exercise \n• as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or \n\ncontraindications \n• in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. \n \nFor study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, \nand the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nMonotherapy  \nThe recommended dose is 0.75 mg once weekly. \n \nAdd-on therapy \nThe recommended dose is 1.5 mg once weekly. \n \nFor potentially vulnerable populations 0.75 mg once weekly can be considered as a starting dose.  \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nWhen Trulicity is added to existing metformin and/or pioglitazone therapy, the current dose of \nmetformin and/or pioglitazone can be continued. When Trulicity is added to existing metformin \nand/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy, the current dose of metformin \nand/or SGLT2i can be continued. When it is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea or insulin, a \nreduction in the dose of sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe use of Trulicity does not require blood glucose self-monitoring. Blood glucose self-monitoring is \nnecessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea or insulin, particularly when Trulicity therapy is started \nand insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin dose reduction is recommended. \n \nMissed doses \nIf a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible if there are at least 3 days (72 hours) \nuntil the next scheduled dose. If less than 3 days (72 hours) remain before the next scheduled dose, \nthe missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be administered on the regularly \nscheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule. \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <90 \nto ≥15 mL/min/1.73m2). \n \nThere is very limited experience in patients with end stage renal disease (<15 ml/min/1.73m2), \ntherefore Trulicity cannot be recommended in this population (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of dulaglutide in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrulicity is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. It should not be \nadministered intravenously or intramuscularly. \n \nThe dose can be administered at any time of day, with or without meals.  \n \nThe day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary, as long as the last dose was \nadministered 3 or more days (72 hours) before. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. \n \nType 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis \n \nDulaglutide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of \ndiabetic ketoacidosis. Dulaglutide is not a substitute for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been \nreported in insulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nSevere gastrointestinal disease  \n \nDulaglutide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe \ngastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients. \n \nDehydration \n \nDehydration, sometimes leading to acute renal failure or worsening renal impairment, has been \nreported in patients treated with dulaglutide, especially at the initiation of treatment. Many of the \nreported adverse renal events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nor dehydration. Patients treated with dulaglutide should be advised of the potential risk of \ndehydration, particularly in relation to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid \nfluid depletion. \n \nAcute pancreatitis \n \nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In \nclinical trials, acute pancreatitis has been reported in association with dulaglutide (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is \nsuspected, dulaglutide should be discontinued. If pancreatitis is confirmed, dulaglutide should not be \nrestarted. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic \nenzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis (see section 4.8). \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nPatients receiving dulaglutide in combination with sulphonylurea or insulin may have an increased \nrisk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of \nsulphonylurea or insulin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium- free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDulaglutide delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the rate of absorption of \nconcomitantly administered oral medicinal products. In the clinical pharmacology studies described \nbelow, dulaglutide doses up to 1.5 mg did not affect the absorption of the orally administered \nmedicinal products tested to any clinically relevant degree.  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \nFor patients receiving dulaglutide in combination with oral medicinal products with rapid \ngastrointestinal absorption or prolonged release , there is a potential for altered medicinal product \nexposure, particularly at the time of dulaglutide treatment initiation.  \n \nSitagliptin \n \nSitagliptin exposure was unaffected when coadministered with a single 1.5 mg dose of dulaglutide. \nFollowing coadministration with 2 consecutive 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide, sitagliptin AUC(0-τ) and \nCmax decreased by approximately 7.4 % and 23.1 %, respectively. Sitagliptin tmax increased \napproximately 0.5 hours following coadministration with dulaglutide compared to sitagliptin alone. \n \nSitagliptin can produce up to 80 % inhibition of DPP-4 over a 24-hour period. Dulaglutide (1.5 mg) \ncoadministration with sitagliptin increased dulaglutide exposure and Cmax by approximately 38 % and \n27 %, respectively, and median tmax increased approximately 24 hours. Therefore, dulaglutide does \nhave a high degree of protection against DPP-4 inactivation (see section 5.1, Mechanism of action). \nThe increased exposure may enhance the effects of dulaglutide on blood glucose levels. \n \nParacetamol \n \nFollowing a first dose of 1 and 3 mg dulaglutide, paracetamol Cmax was reduced by 36 % and 50 %, \nrespectively, and the median tmax occurred later (3 and 4 hours, respectively). After coadministration \nwith up to 3 mg of dulaglutide at steady state, there were no statistically significant differences on \nAUC(0-12), Cmax or tmax of paracetamol. No dose adjustment of paracetamol is necessary when \nadministered with dulaglutide. \n \nAtorvastatin \n \nCoadministration of 1.5 mg of dulaglutide with atorvastatin decreased Cmax and AUC(0-∞) up to 70 % \nand 21 %, respectively, for atorvastatin and its major metabolite o-hydroxyatorvastatin. The mean t1/2 \nof atorvastatin and o-hydroxyatorvastatin were increased by 17 % and 41 %, respectively, following \ndulaglutide administration. These observations are not clinically relevant. No dose adjustment of \natorvastatin is necessary when administered with dulaglutide. \n \nDigoxin  \n \nAfter coadministration of steady state digoxin with 2 consecutive 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide, overall \nexposure (AUCτ) and tmax of digoxin were unchanged; and Cmax decreased by up to 22 %. This change \nis not expected to have clinical consequences. No dose adjustment is required for digoxin when \nadministered with dulaglutide. \n \nAnti-hypertensives \n \nCoadministration of multiple dulaglutide 1.5 mg doses with steady state lisinopril caused no clinically \nrelevant changes in the AUC or Cmax of lisinopril. Statistically significant delays in lisinopril tmax of \napproximately 1 hour were observed on Days 3 and 24 of the study. When a single 1.5 mg dose of \ndulaglutide and metoprolol were coadministered, the AUC and Cmax of metoprolol increased by19 % \nand 32 %, respectively. While metoprolol tmax was delayed by 1 hour, this change was not statistically \nsignificant. These changes were not clinically relevant; therefore no dose adjustment of lisinopril or \nmetoprolol is necessary when administered with dulaglutide. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nWarfarin  \n \nFollowing dulaglutide (1.5 mg) coadministration, S- and R-warfarin exposure and R-warfarin Cmax \n\nwere unaffected, and S-warfarin Cmax decreased by 22 %. AUCINR increased by 2 %, which is unlikely \nto be clinically significant, and there was no effect on maximum international normalised ratio \nresponse (INRmax). The time of international normalised ratio response (tINRmax) was delayed by \n6 hours, consistent with delays in tmax of approximately 4 and 6 hours for S- and R-warfarin, \nrespectively. These changes are not clinically relevant. No dose adjustment for warfarin is necessary \nwhen given together with dulaglutide. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nCoadministration of dulaglutide (1.5 mg) with an oral contraceptive (norgestimate 0.18 mg/ethinyl \nestradiol 0.025 mg) did not affect the overall exposure to norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol. \nStatistically significant reductions in Cmax of 26 % and 13 % and delays in tmax of 2 and 0.30 hours \nwere observed for norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol, respectively. These observations are not \nclinically relevant. No dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is required when given together with \ndulaglutide. \n \nMetformin \n \nFollowing coadministration of multiple 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide with steady state metformin \n(immediate release formula [IR]), metformin AUCτ increased up to 15 % and Cmax decreased up to \n12 %, respectively, with no changes in tmax. These changes are consistent with the gastric emptying \ndelay of dulaglutide and within the pharmacokinetic variability of metformin and thus are not \nclinically relevant. No dose adjustment for metformin IR is recommended when given with \ndulaglutide. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of dulaglutide in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Therefore, the use of dulaglutide is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether dulaglutide is excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. Dulaglutide should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of dulaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. In the rat, there was no direct effect on \nmating or fertility following treatment with dulaglutide (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTrulicity has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When it is used in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid \nhypoglycaemia while driving and using machines (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nIn the completed phase 2 and phase 3 studies to support the initial registration of dulaglutide 0.75 mg \nand 1.5 mg, 4,006 patients were exposed to dulaglutide alone or in combination with other glucose \nlowering medicinal products. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were \ngastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In general, these reactions were mild or \nmoderate in severity and transient in nature. Results from the long-term cardiovascular outcome study \nwith 4,949 patients randomised to dulaglutide and followed for a median of 5.4 years were consistent \nwith these findings. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified based on evaluation of the full duration of the \nphase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies, the long-term cardiovascular outcome study and post-marketing \nreports. The adverse reactions are listed in Table 1 as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class \nand in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: < 1/10,000 and not known: cannot be \nestimated from available data). Within each incidence grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing frequency. Frequencies for events have been calculated based on their incidence \nin the phase 2 and phase 3 registration studies. \n \nTable 1.

The severe hypoglycaemia event incidences \nwere 0% and 0.7%, and rates were 0.00 and 0.01 events/patient/year for each dose, respectively. The \nincidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia when dulaglutide 1.5 mg was used with \nsulphonylurea alone was 11.3% and the rate was 0.90 events/patient/year, and there were no episodes \nof severe hypoglycaemia. \n \nThe incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia when dulaglutide 1.5 mg was used in \ncombination with insulin glargine was 35.3% and the rate was 3.38 events/patient/year. The severe \nhypoglycaemia event incidence was 0.7% and the rate was 0.01 events/patient/year. \n \nThe incidences when dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively, were used in combination with \nprandial insulin were 85.3% and 80.0% and rates were 35.66 and 31.06 events/patient/year. The \nsevere hypoglycaemia event incidences were 2.4% and 3.4%, and rates were 0.05 and \n0.06 events/patient/year. \n \nIn a phase 3 study through to week 52, when dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg were used in \ncombination with metformin, the incidences of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia were 3.1 %, \n2.4 % and 3.1 %, respectively, and rates were 0.07, 0.05 and 0.07 events/patient/year; one episode of \nsevere hypoglycaemia was reported with dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 4.5 mg, respectively. \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \nCumulative reporting of gastrointestinal events up to 104 weeks with dulaglutide 0.75mg and 1.5 mg, \nrespectively, included nausea (12.9% and 21.2 %), diarrhoea (10.7% and 13.7 %) and vomiting (6.9% \nand 11.5 %). These were typically mild or moderate in severity and were reported to peak during the \nfirst 2 weeks of treatment and rapidly declined over the next 4 weeks, after which the rate remained \nrelatively constant. \n \nIn a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses respectively, cumulative reporting \nof gastrointestinal events through to 52 weeks included nausea (14.2 %, 16.1 % and 17.3 %), \ndiarrhoea (7.7 %, 12.0 % and 11.6 %) and vomiting (6.4 %, 9.1 % and 10.1 %). \n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fatigue Injection site \nreactions \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Sinus \ntachycardia, first \ndegree \natrioventricular \nblock (AVB) \n\n   \n\n\n\n36 \n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus up to 6 weeks, the \nmajority of gastrointestinal events were reported during the first 2-3 days after the initial dose and \ndeclined with subsequent doses. \n \nAcute pancreatitis  \nThe incidence of acute pancreatitis in Phase 2 and 3 registration studies was 0.07% for dulaglutide \ncompared to 0.14% for placebo and 0.19% for comparators with or without additional background \nantidiabetic therapy. \n \nPancreatic enzymes \nDulaglutide is associated with mean increases from baseline in pancreatic enzymes (lipase and/or \npancreatic amylase) of 11 % to 21 % (see section 4.4). In the absence of other signs and symptoms of \nacute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis. \n \nHeart rate increase  \nSmall mean increases in heart rate of 2 to 4 beats per minute (bpm) and a 1.3% and 1.4 % incidence of \nsinus tachycardia, with a concomitant increase from baseline ≥ 15 bpm, were observed with \ndulaglutide 0.75mg and 1.5 mg, respectively. \n \nIn a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of sinus \ntachycardia, with a concomitant increase from baseline ≥ 15 bpm, was 2.6 %, 1.9 % and 2.6 % \nrespectively. Mean increases in heart rate of 1 – 4 beats per minute (bpm) were observed. \n \nFirst degree AV block/PR interval prolongation  \nSmall mean increases from baseline in PR interval of 2 to 3 msec and a 1.5% and 2.4 % incidence of \nfirst-degree AV block were observed with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively. \n \nIn a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of first-degree AV \nblock was 1.2 %, 3.8 % and 1.7 % respectively. Mean increases from baseline in PR interval of \n3 – 5 msec were observed.  \n \nImmunogenicity  \nIn registration studies, treatment with dulaglutide was associated with a 1.6 % incidence of treatment \nemergent dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies, indicating that the structural modifications in the GLP-1 \nand modified IgG4 parts of the dulaglutide molecule, together with high homology with native GLP-1 \nand native IgG4, minimise the risk of immune response against dulaglutide. Patients with dulaglutide \nanti-drug antibodies generally had low titres, and although the number of patients developing \ndulaglutide anti-drug antibodies was low, examination of the phase 3 data revealed no clear impact of \ndulaglutide anti-drug antibodies on changes in HbA1c. None of the patients with systemic \nhypersensitivity developed dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies. \n \nHypersensitivity  \nIn the phase 2 and phase 3 registration studies, systemic hypersensitivity events (e.g., urticaria, \nedema) were reported in 0.5 % of patients receiving dulaglutide. Cases of anaphylactic reaction have \nbeen rarely reported with marketed use of dulaglutide.  \n \nInjection site reactions  \nInjection site adverse events were reported in 1.9 % of patients receiving dulaglutide. Potentially \nimmune-mediated injection site adverse events (e.g., rash, erythema) were reported in 0.7 % of \npatients and were usually mild. \n \nDiscontinuation due to an adverse event \nIn studies of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 2.6% \n(0.75 mg) and 6.1% (1.5 mg) for dulaglutide versus 3.7 % for placebo. Through the full study \nduration (up to 104 weeks), the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 5.1% \n\n\n\n37 \n\n(0.75 mg) and 8.4 % (1.5 mg) for dulaglutide. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to \ndiscontinuation for 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg dulaglutide, respectively, were nausea (1.0%, 1.9 %), \ndiarrhoea (0.5%, 0.6 %), and vomiting (0.4%, 0.6 %), and were generally reported within the first \n4-6 weeks. \n \nIn a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of discontinuation \ndue to adverse events through 52 weeks was 6.0 % (1.5 mg), 7.0 % (3 mg) and 8.5 % (4.5 mg).  The \nmost frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg, \nrespectively, were nausea (1.3 %, 1.3 %, 1.5 %), diarrhoea (0.2 %, 1.0 %, 1.0 %), and vomiting \n(0.0 %, 0.8 %, 1.3 %). \n \nDulaglutide doses of 3 mg and 4.5 mg  \nThe safety profile in patients treated with dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg once weekly is consistent with \nthat described above for dulaglutide doses of 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nEffects of overdose with dulaglutide in clinical studies have included gastrointestinal disorders and \nhypoglycaemia. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated \naccording to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins, \nATC code: A10BJ05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDulaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. The molecule consists \nof 2 identical disulfide-linked chains, each containing a modified human GLP-1 analogue sequence \ncovalently linked to a modified human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) heavy chain fragment (Fc) by a \nsmall peptide linker. The GLP-1 analog portion of dulaglutide is approximately 90 % homologous to \nnative human GLP-1 (7-37). Native GLP-1 has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by \nDPP-4 and renal clearance. In contrast to native GLP-1, dulaglutide is resistant to degradation by \nDPP-4, and has a large size that slows absorption and reduces renal clearance. These engineering \nfeatures result in a soluble formulation and a prolonged half-life of 4.7 days, which makes it suitable \nfor once-weekly subcutaneous administration. In addition, the dulaglutide molecule was engineered to \nprevent the Fcγ receptor-dependent immune response and to reduce its immunogenic potential. \n \nDulaglutide exhibits several antihyperglycaemic actions of GLP-1. In the presence of elevated glucose \nconcentrations, dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in pancreatic beta cells leading \nto insulin release. Dulaglutide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately \nelevated in patients with type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic \nglucose output. Dulaglutide also slows gastric emptying. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n38 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDulaglutide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering fasting, pre-meal \nand postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes starting after the first \ndulaglutide administration and is sustained throughout the once weekly dosing interval. \n \nA pharmacodynamic study with dulaglutide demonstrated, in patients with type 2 diabetes, a \nrestoration of first phase insulin secretion to a level that exceeded levels observed in healthy subjects \non placebo, and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to an intravenous bolus of \nglucose. In the same study, a single 1.5 mg dose of dulaglutide appeared to increase maximal insulin \nsecretion from the β-cells, and to enhance β-cell function in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus as \ncompared with placebo. \n \nConsistent with the pharmacokinetic profile, dulaglutide has a pharmacodynamic profile suitable for \nonce weekly administration (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nGlycaemic control \nThe safety and efficacy of dulaglutide were evaluated in ten randomised, controlled, phase 3 trials \ninvolving 8,035 patients with type 2 diabetes. Of these, 1,644 were ≥ 65 years of which 174 were \n≥ 75 years. These studies included 5,650 dulaglutide treated patients, of whom 1,558 were treated \nwith Trulicity 0.75 mg weekly, 2,862 were treated with Trulicity 1.5 mg weekly, 616 were treated \nwith Trulicity 3 mg weekly and 614 were treated with Trulicity 4.5 mg weekly. In all studies, \ndulaglutide produced clinically significant improvements in glycaemic control as measured by \nglycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).  \n \nMonotherapy \nDulaglutide was studied in a 52-week active controlled monotherapy study in comparison to \nmetformin. Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were superior to metformin (1500-2000 mg/day) in the \nreduction in HbA1c and a significantly greater proportion of patients reached an HbA1c target of \n< 7.0 % and ≤ 6.5 % with Trulicity 1.5 mg and Trulicity 0.75 mg compared to metformin at 26 weeks.  \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nTable 2.Results of a 52-week active controlled monotherapy study with two doses of dulaglutide in \ncomparison to metformin \n \n\n Baseline \nHbA1c \n\nMean \nchange in \n\nHbA1c \n\nPatients at target \nHbA1c \n\nChange in \nFBG \n\nChange in  \nbody \n\nweight \n (%) (%) <7.0% \n\n(%) \n≤6.5% \n\n(%) \n(mmol/L) (kg) \n\n26 weeks \nDulaglutide 1.5 mg \nonce weekly \n(n=269) \n\n7.63 -0.78†† 61.5# 46.0## -1.61 -2.29 \n\nDulaglutide 0.75 \nmg \nonce weekly \n(n=270) \n\n7.58 -0.71†† 62.6# 40.0# -1.46 -1.36# \n\nMetformin \n\n1500-2000 mg/day \n(n=268) \n\n7.60 -0.56 53.6 29.8 -1.34 -2.22 \n\n52 weeks \nDulaglutide 1.5 mg \nonce weekly \n(n=269) \n\n7.63 -0.70†† 60.0# 42.3## -1.56# -1.93 \n\nDulaglutide 0.75 \nmg once weekly \n(n=270) \n\n7.58 -0.55† 53.2 34.7 -1.00 -1.09# \n\nMetformin \n1500-2000 mg/day \n(n=268) \n\n7.60 -0.51 48.3 28.3 -1.15 -2.20 \n\n† multiplicity adjusted 1-sided p-value < 0.025, for noninferiority; †† multiplicity adjusted 1-sided \np-value < 0.025, for superiority of dulaglutide to metformin, assessed for HbA1c only \n\n# p < 0.05, ## p < 0.001 dulaglutide treatment group compared to metformin  \nFBG = fasting blood glucose \n \nThe rate of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg, and \nmetformin were 0.62, 0.15, and 0.09 episodes/patient/year, respectively.

The durability of effect on beta-cell function was \nmaintained through the longest study duration of 104 weeks. \n \nBody weight \nTrulicity 1.5 mg was associated with sustained weight reduction over the duration of studies (from \nbaseline to final time point -0.35 kg to -2.90 kg). Changes in body weight with Trulicity 0.75 mg \n\n\n\n47 \n\nranged from 0.86 kg to -2.63 kg. Reduction in body weight was observed in patients treated with \ndulaglutide irrespective of nausea, though the reduction was numerically larger in the group with \nnausea. \n \nPatient reported outcomes \nDulaglutide significantly improved total treatment satisfaction compared to exenatide twice daily. In \naddition, there was significantly lower perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia \ncompared to exenatide twice daily. \n \nBlood pressure \nThe effect of dulaglutide on blood pressure as assessed by Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring \nwas evaluated in a study of 755 patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with dulaglutide provided \nreductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-2.8 mmHg difference compared to placebo) at 16 weeks. \nThere was no difference in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Similar results for SBP and DBP were \ndemonstrated at the final 26 week time point of the study. \n \nCardiovascular Evaluation \n \nMeta-analysis of phase 2 and 3 studies \nIn a meta-analysis of phase 2 and 3 registration studies, a total of 51 patients (dulaglutide: 26 [N = \n3,885]; all comparators: 25 [N = 2,125]) experienced at least one cardiovascular (CV) event (death \ndue to CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina). The results \nshowed that there was no increase in CV risk with dulaglutide compared with control therapies (HR: \n0.57; CI: [0.30, 1.10]). \n \nCardiovascular outcome study \nThe Trulicity long-term cardiovascular outcome study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical \ntrial. Type 2 diabetes patients were randomly allocated to either Trulicity 1.5 mg (4,949) or placebo \n(4,952) both in addition to standards of care for type 2 diabetes (the 0.75 mg dose was not \nadministered in this study). The median study follow-up time was 5.4 years.  \n \nThe mean age was 66.2 years, the mean BMI was 32.3 kg/m², and 46.3 % of patients were female. \nThere were 3,114 (31.5 %) patients with established CV disease. The median baseline HbA1c was \n7.2 %. The Trulicity treatment arm included patients ≥ 65 years (n = 2,619) and ≥ 75 years (n = 484), \nand patients with mild (n = 2,435), moderate (n = 1,031) or severe (n = 50) renal impairment.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of any major adverse \ncardiovascular events (MACE): CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. \nTrulicity was superior in preventing MACE compared to placebo (Figure 1). Each MACE component \ncontributed to the reduction of MACE, as shown in Figure 2. \n \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n \nFigure 1. Kaplan-Meier plot of time to first occurrence of the composite outcome: CV death, non-fatal \nmyocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke, in the dulaglutide long-term cardiovascular outcome study \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 2. Forest plot of analyses of individual cardiovascular event types, all cause death, and \nconsistency of effect across subgroups for the primary endpoint  \n \nA significant and sustained reduction in HbA1c levels from baseline to month 60 was observed with \nTrulicity vs placebo, in addition to standard of care (-0.29 % vs 0.22 %; estimated treatment \ndifference -0.51 % [-0.57; -0.45]; p < 0.001). There were significantly fewer patients in the Trulicity \ngroup who received an additional glycaemic intervention compared to placebo (Trulicity: 2,086 \n[42.2 %]; placebo: 2,825 [57.0 %]; p < 0.001). \n \nCombination of dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 3 mg and 1.5 mg therapy with metformin \nThe safety and efficacy of dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg once weekly compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg \nonce weekly as add-on to metformin were investigated in a 52 weeks study. At 36 weeks, both \nTrulicity 3 mg and 4.5 mg were superior to Trulicity 1.5 mg in lowering of HbA1c and body weight. \n\n\n\n50 \n\nA greater percentage of patients achieved HbA1c targets of < 7.0 % or ≤ 6.5 % at 36 weeks with \nTrulicity 3 mg and Trulicity 4.5 mg. The proportions of patients that achieved ≥ 5 % body weight \nreduction from baseline were 31 %, 40 % and 49 % for Trulicity 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg \nrespectively. These effects were sustained through 52 weeks. \n \nTable 11.

At baseline, overall mean \neGFR was 38 mL/min/1.73 m2, 30% of patients had eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. \n \nAt 26 weeks, both Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were non-inferior to insulin glargine in lowering of \nHbA1c and this effect was sustained at 52 weeks. A similar percentage of patients achieved HbA1c \ntargets of < 8.0 % at 26 and 52 weeks with both dulaglutide doses as well as insulin glargine. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nTable 12.

No patients \nreported cases of severe hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, six with dulaglutide 0.75 mg, and \nseventeen with insulin glargine. The safety profile of dulaglutide in patients with renal impairment \nwas similar to that observed in other studies with dulaglutide. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTrulicity in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of type 2 diabetes \nmellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration to patients with type 2 diabetes, dulaglutide reaches peak \nplasma concentrations in 48 hours. The mean peak (Cmax) and total (AUC) exposures were \napproximately 114 ng/ml and 14,000 ngh/ml, respectively, after multiple subcutaneous 1.5 mg doses \nof dulaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved \nbetween 2 to 4 weeks of once-weekly administration of dulaglutide (1.5 mg). Exposures after \nsubcutaneous administration of single dulaglutide (1.5 mg) doses in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm \nwere comparable. The mean absolute bioavailability of dulaglutide following single-dose \nsubcutaneous administration of single 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg doses was 47 % and 65%, respectively. \nAbsolute bioavailabilities for 3 mg and 4.5 mg doses were estimated to be similar to 1.5 mg although \n\n\n\n53 \n\nthey have not been specifically studied. Over the dose range 0.75 mg to 4.5 mg, the increase in \ndulaglutide concentration is approximately proportional. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent population mean central volume of distribution was 3.09 L and the apparent population \nmean peripheral volume of distribution was 5.98 L. \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nDulaglutide is presumed to be degraded into its component amino acids by general protein catabolism \npathways. \n \nElimination \n \nApparent population mean clearance of dulaglutide was 0.142 L/h. and the elimination half-life was \napproximately 5 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nAge had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of \ndulaglutide. \n \nGender and race \nGender and race had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide. \n \nBody weight or body mass index \nPharmacokinetic analyses have demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship between \nbody weight or body mass index (BMI) and dulaglutide exposure, although there was no clinically \nrelevant impact of weight or BMI on glycaemic control. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide were evaluated in a clinical pharmacology study and were \ngenerally similar between healthy subjects and patients with mild to severe renal impairment \n(CrCl < 30 ml/min), including end stage renal disease (requiring dialysis). Additionally, in a 52-week \nclinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR [by \nCKD-EPI] <60 and ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2), the pharmacokinetic profile of Trulicity 0.75 mg and 1.5 \nmg once weekly was similar to that demonstrated in previous clinical studies. This clinical study did \nnot include patients with end stage renal disease. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide were evaluated in a clinical pharmacology study, where subjects \nwith hepatic impairment had statistically significant decreases in dulaglutide exposure of up to 30 % \nto 33 % for mean Cmax and AUC, respectively, compared to healthy controls. There was a general \nincrease in tmax of dulaglutide with increased hepatic impairment. However, no trend in dulaglutide \nexposure was observed relative to the degree of hepatic impairment. These effects were not \nconsidered to be clinically relevant. \n \nPaediatric population \nStudies characterising the pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide in paediatric patients have not been \nperformed. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology or repeat-dose toxicity. \n \nIn a 6-month carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice, there was no tumorigenic response. In a 2-year \ncarcinogenicity study in rats, at ≥ 3 times the human clinical exposure following 4.5 mg dulaglutide \nper week, dulaglutide caused statistically significant, dose-related increases in the incidence of thyroid \nC-cell tumours (adenomas and carcinomas combined). The clinical relevance of these findings is \ncurrently unknown.  \n \nDuring the fertility studies, a reduction in the number of corpora lutea and prolonged oestrous cycle \nwere observed at dose levels that were associated with decreased food intake and body weight gain in \nmaternal animals; however, no effects on indices of fertility and conception or embryonic \ndevelopment were observed. In reproductive toxicology studies, skeletal effects and a reduction in \nfoetal growth were observed in the rat and rabbit at exposures of dulaglutide 5- to 18-fold higher than \nthose proposed clinically, but no foetal malformations were observed. Treatment of rats throughout \npregnancy and lactation produced memory deficits in female offspring at exposures that were 7-fold \nhigher than those proposed clinically. Dulaglutide dosing of male and female juvenile rats did not \nproduce memory deficits at 38-fold the highest human exposure.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Trulicity is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Trulicity \n3. How to use Trulicity \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Trulicity \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Trulicity is and what it is used for \n \nTrulicity contains an active substance called dulaglutide and is used to lower blood sugar (glucose) in \nadults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and can help prevent heart disease. \n \nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that  \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should.  \n \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. \n \nTrulicity is used: \n- on its own if your blood sugar is not properly controlled by diet and exercise alone, and you \n\ncan’t take metformin (another diabetes medicine). \n- or with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar \n\nlevels. These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by \ninjection. \n\n \nIt is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Trulicity \n \nDo not use Trulicity \n\n- if you are allergic to dulaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n114 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Trulicity if: \n\n- you are on dialysis as this medicine is not recommended. \n- you have type 1 diabetes (the type when your body does not produce any insulin) as this \n\nmedicine may not be right for you. \n- you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is unable \n\nto break down glucose because there is not enough insulin). The signs include rapid weight \nloss, feeling sick or being sick, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your \nmouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat. \n\n- you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer \nthan normal (including gastroparesis). \n\n- you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) which causes severe pain in the \nstomach and back which does not go away. \n\n- you are taking a sulphonylurea or insulin for your diabetes, as low blood sugar \n(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these other \nmedicines to reduce this risk. \n\nTrulicity is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. \n \nWhen initiating treatment with Trulicity, you may in some cases experience loss of \nfluids/dehydration, e.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea which may lead to a decrease in \nkidney function. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor \nif you have any questions or concerns. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTrulicity is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not \nbeen studied in these patients. \n \nOther medicines and Trulicity \nBecause Trulicity can slow stomach emptying which could affect other medicines, tell your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicine. \n \nPregnancy  \nIt is not known if dulaglutide could harm your unborn child. Women who could become pregnant \nshould use contraception during treatment with dulagutide. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think \nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as Trulicity should not be used during \npregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nTalk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. Do not use \nTrulicity if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if dulaglutide passes into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTrulicity has no to little effect on the ability to drive or use machines. However, if you use Trulicity in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may \nreduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any signs of low blood \nsugar. See section 2, ‘Warning and precautions’ for information on increased risk of low blood sugar \nand section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information. \n \nTrulicity contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n3. How to use Trulicity \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine. \n \nYour doctor may recommend a dose of 0.75 mg once a week for the treatment of your diabetes either \ndue to your individual needs or when Trulicity is used alone. \n \nWhen used with other medicines for diabetes, your doctor may recommend a dose of 1.5 mg once a \nweek.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is not controlled well enough, your doctor may increase your dose to 3 mg once a \nweek.   \n \nIf further blood sugar control is needed the dose may be increased again to 4.5 mg once a week.   \n \nEach pen contains one weekly dose of Trulicity (0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg or 4.5 mg). Each pen delivers \nonly one dose.  \n \nYou can use your pen at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same \nday each week if you can. To help you remember, you may wish to tick the day of the week when you \ninject your first dose on the box that your pen comes in, or on a calendar. \n \nTrulicity is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper \nleg (thigh). If the injection is given by someone else, they may inject in your upper arm. \n \nIf you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a \ndifferent injection site within that area. \n \nIt is important that you test your blood glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse, if you are taking Trulicity with a sulphonylurea or insulin. \n \nRead the “Instructions for Use” for the pen carefully before using Trulicity. \n \nIf you use more Trulicity than you should \nIf you use more Trulicity than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this medicine \nmay make your blood sugar too low (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick. \n \nIf you forget to use Trulicity \nIf you forget to inject a dose, and if there are at least 3 days before your next dose is due, then inject \nyour dose as soon as possible. Inject your next dose on your regular scheduled day. \n \nIf there are less then 3 days before your next dose is due, skip the dose and inject the next one on \nyour regular scheduled day. \n \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nYou can also change the day of the week on which you inject Trulicity if necessary, as long as it has \nbeen at least 3 days since your last dose of Trulicity. \n \nIf you stop using Trulicity \nDo not stop using Trulicity without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Trulicity, your blood \nsugar levels can increase. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n\n\n116 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSevere side effects \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic reactions, angioedema).  \n\n You should see a doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as rashes, itching and \nrapid swelling of the tissues of the neck, face, mouth or throat, hives and difficulties breathing. \n\n \n- Inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) which could cause severe pain in the stomach and back \n\nwhich does not go away.  \nYou should see a doctor immediately if you experience such symptoms. \n\n \nNot known: the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n\n- Bowel obstruction - a severe form of constipation with additional symptoms such as stomach \nache, bloating or vomiting.  \n\n You should see a doctor immediately if you experience such symptoms. \n \nOther side effects \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\n- Feeling sick (nausea) – this usually goes away over time \n- Being sick (vomiting) – this usually goes away over time \n- Diarrhoea – this usually goes away over time \n- Stomach (abdominal) pain. \n\nThese side effects are usually not severe. They are most common when first starting dulaglutide but \ndecrease over time in most patients. \n \n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common when dulaglutide is used with medicines \nthat contain metformin, a sulphonylurea and/or insulin.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What you need to know before you use Trulicity \n3. How to use Trulicity \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Trulicity \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Trulicity is and what it is used for \n \nTrulicity contains an active substance called dulaglutide and is used to lower blood sugar (glucose) in \nadults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and can help prevent heart disease. \n \nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that  \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should.  \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. \n \nTrulicity is used: \n- on its own if your blood sugar is not properly controlled by diet and exercise alone, and you \n\ncan’t take metformin (another diabetes medicine). \n- or with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar \n\nlevels. These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by \ninjection. \n\n \nIt is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Trulicity \n \nDo not use Trulicity \n\n- if you are allergic to dulaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Trulicity if: \n\n- you are on dialysis as this medicine is not recommended. \n\n\n\n121 \n\n- you have type 1 diabetes (the type when your body does not produce any insulin) as this \nmedicine may not be right for you. \n\n- you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is unable \nto break down glucose because there is not enough insulin). The signs include rapid weight \nloss, feeling sick or being sick, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your \nmouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat. \n\n- you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer \nthan normal (including gastroparesis). \n\n- you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) which causes severe pain in the \nstomach and back which does not go away. \n\n- you are taking a sulphonylurea or insulin for your diabetes, as low blood sugar \n(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these other \nmedicines to reduce this risk. \n\n \nTrulicity is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. \n \nWhen initiating treatment with Trulicity, you may in some cases experience loss of \nfluids/dehydration, e.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea which may lead to a decrease in \nkidney function. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor \nif you have any questions or concerns. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTrulicity is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not \nbeen studied in these patients. \n \nOther medicines and Trulicity \nBecause Trulicity can slow stomach emptying which could affect other medicines, tell your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nIt is not known if dulaglutide could harm your unborn child. Women who could become pregnant \nshould use contraception during treatment with dulagutide. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think \nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as Trulicity should not be used during \npregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nTalk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. Do not use \nTrulicity if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if dulaglutide passes into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTrulicity has no to little effect on the ability to drive or use machines. However, if you use Trulicity in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may \nreduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any signs of low blood \nsugar. See section 2, ‘Warning and precautions’ for information on increased risk of low blood sugar \nand section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information. \n \nTrulicity contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n3. How to use Trulicity \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n122 \n\nYour doctor may recommend a dose of 0.75 mg once a week for the treatment of your diabetes either \ndue to your individual needs or when Trulicity is used alone.  \n \nWhen used with other medicines for diabetes, your doctor may recommend a dose of 1.5 mg once a \nweek. \n \nEach syringe contains one weekly dose of Trulicity (0.75 mg or 1.5 mg). Each syringe delivers only \none dose. \n \nYou can use your syringe at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same \nday each week if you can. To help you remember, you may wish to tick the day of the week when you \ninject your first dose on the box that your syringe comes in, or on a calendar. \n \nTrulicity is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper \nleg (thigh). If the injection is given by someone else, they may inject in your upper arm. \n \nIf you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a \ndifferent injection site within that area. \n \nIt is important that you test your blood glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse, if you are taking Trulicity with a sulphonylurea or insulin. \n \nRead the “Instructions for Use” for the syringe carefully before using Trulicity. \n \nIf you use more Trulicity than you should \nIf you use more Trulicity than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this medicine \nmay make your blood sugar too low (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick. \n \nIf you forget to use Trulicity \nIf you forget to inject a dose, and if there are at least 3 days before your next dose is due, then inject \nyour dose as soon as possible. Inject your next dose on your regular scheduled day. \n \nIf there are less then 3 days before your next dose is due, skip the dose and inject the next one on \nyour regular scheduled day. \n \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nYou can also change the day of the week on which you inject Trulicity if necessary, as long as it has \nbeen at least 3 days since your last dose of Trulicity. \n \nIf you stop using Trulicity \nDo not stop using Trulicity without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Trulicity, your blood \nsugar levels can increase. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n123 \n\nSevere side effects \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n\n- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic reactions, angioedema).  \nYou should see a doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as rashes, itching and \nrapid swelling of the tissues of the neck, face, mouth or throat, hives and difficulties breathing. \n\n \n-  Inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) which could cause severe pain in the stomach and back \n\nwhich does not go away.  \nYou should see a doctor immediately if you experience such symptoms. \n\n \nNot known: the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n\n- Bowel obstruction - a severe form of constipation with additional symptoms such as stomach \nache, bloating or vomiting.  \nYou should see a doctor immediately if you experience such symptoms. \n\n \nOther side effects \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n- Feeling sick (nausea) – this usually goes away over time \n- Being sick (vomiting) – this usually goes away over time \n- Diarrhoea – this usually goes away over time \n- Stomach (abdominal) pain. \n \nThese side effects are usually not severe.

If you are taking a sulphonylurea or \ninsulin, the dose may need to be lowered while you use dulaglutide. \n\n- Symptoms of low blood sugar may include headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, feeling \nhungry, confusion, irritability, fast heartbeat and sweating. Your doctor should tell you how to \ntreat low blood sugar. \n\n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is common when dulaglutide is used alone, or with both \nmetformin and pioglitazone together, or with a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor \n(SGLT2i) with or without metformin. For a list of possible symptoms, see above under very \ncommon affects. \n\n- Feeling less hungry (decreased appetite) \n- Indigestion \n- Constipation \n- Gas (flatulence) \n- Bloating of the stomach \n- Reflux or heartburn (also called gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD) - a disease caused by \n\nstomach acid coming up into the tube from your stomach to your mouth \n- Burping \n- Feeling tired \n- Increased heart rate  \n- Slowing of the electrical currents in the heart \n\n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\n- Injection site reactions (e.g. rash or redness) \n- Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) (e.g. swelling, raised itchy skin rash (hives)) \n- Dehydration, often associated with nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea \n- Gallstones \n- Inflamed gallbladder \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
