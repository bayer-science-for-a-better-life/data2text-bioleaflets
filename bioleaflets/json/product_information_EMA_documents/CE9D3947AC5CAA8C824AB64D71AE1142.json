NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAVANDIA 2 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains rosiglitazone maleate corresponding to 2 mg rosiglitazone. \n \nExcipient \nContains lactose (approximately 108 mg). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPink film-coated tablets debossed with “GSK” on one side and \"2\" on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRosiglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus:  \n \nas monotherapy \n– in patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for \n\nwhom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance \n \nas dual oral therapy in combination with \n– metformin, in patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control \n\ndespite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin \n– a sulphonylurea, only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is \n\ncontraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite monotherapy with a sulphonylurea \n \nas triple oral therapy in combination with \n– metformin and a sulphonylurea, in patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient \n\nglycaemic control despite dual oral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRosiglitazone therapy is usually initiated at 4 mg/day. This dose can be increased to 8 mg/day after \neight weeks if greater glycaemic control is required. In patients administered rosiglitazone in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea, an increase in rosiglitazone to 8 mg/day should be undertaken \ncautiously following appropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse \nreactions relating to fluid retention (see 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRosiglitazone may be given once or twice a day. \n \nRosiglitazone may be taken with or without food. \n \nElderly (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure) \nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n3 \n\nPatients with renal impairment (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure) \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiency. Limited data \nare available in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and \ntherefore rosiglitazone should be used with caution in these patients. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nRosiglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere are no data available on the use of rosiglitazone in patients under 10 years of age. For children \naged 10 to 17 years, there are limited data on rosiglitazone as monotherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \nThe available data do not support efficacy in the paediatric population and therefore such use is not \nrecommended. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nUse of rosiglitazone is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n− known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone or to any of the excipients  \n \n− cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA class I to IV) \n \n− an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) \n \n− hepatic impairment \n \n-  diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \nThiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention.  The possible \ncontribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive \nweight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those \nreceiving concurrent insulin or sulphonylurea therapy, those at risk for heart failure, and those with \nreduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions relating to \nfluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure. Increased monitoring of the patient is \nrecommended if rosiglitazone is used in combination with metformin and insulin.  Rosiglitazone \nshould be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.  \n \nHeart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and \nheart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited \nexperience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs and rosiglitazone are associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. \n \nCombination with insulin \nAn increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is \nused in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic \nheart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases \nand under close supervision. \n \nMyocardial Ischaemia \nA retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment \nwith rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n4 \n\nin their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8).  \nThere are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial \ndisease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, \nparticularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. \n \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) \nPatients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view \nof the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be \ninitiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute \nphase (see section 4.3). \n \nMonitoring of liver function \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience (see \nsection 4.8). There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated liver enzymes \n(ALT >2.5X upper limit of normal). Therefore, liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation \nof therapy with rosiglitazone in all patients and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgement. \nTherapy with rosiglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme \nlevels (ALT >2.5X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease. If ALT levels \nare increased to >3X upper limit of normal during rosiglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be \nreassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain >3X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be \ndiscontinued. If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include \nunexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes \nshould be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with rosiglitazone should \nbe guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, drug therapy \nshould be discontinued. \n \nEye disorders \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should \nbe considered. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater \nwhen used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it \nmay be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure.  \n \nAnaemia \nRosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels. In patients \nwith low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during \ntreatment with rosiglitazone. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nPatients receiving rosiglitazone in combination therapy with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, may be at \nrisk for dose-related hypoglycaemia. Increased monitoring of the patient and a reduction in the dose of \nthe concomitant agent may be necessary. \n \nTriple oral therapy \nThe use of rosiglitazone in triple oral therapy, in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea, \nmay be associated with increased risks for fluid retention and heart failure, as well as hypoglycaemia \n(see section 4.8). Increased monitoring of the patient is recommended and adjustment of the dose of \nsulphonylurea may be necessary. The decision to initiate triple oral therapy should include \nconsideration of the alternative to switch the patient to insulin. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n5 \n\nBone disorders \nLong-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper \nlimbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of \ntreatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the \ncare of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. \n \nOthers \nPremenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies. Although hormonal \nimbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects \nassociated with menstrual disorders have been observed. As a consequence of improving insulin \nsensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin \nresistance. Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become \npregnant or if pregnancy occurs the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). \n \nRosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min). \n \nRosiglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors \n(e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored closely. \nRosiglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment \nshould be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nAVANDIA tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with \nCYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.  \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold \nincrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of \ndose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of \nglycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease \nin rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The \nrosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n \nClinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated. \n \nConcomitant administration with the oral anti-diabetic agents metformin, glibenclamide and acarbose \ndid not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with rosiglitazone. Moderate \ningestion of alcohol with rosiglitazone has no effect on glycaemic control. \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 \nsubstrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with \nrosiglitazone. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nRosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rosiglitazone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n6 \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rosiglitazone \nshould not be used during pregnancy. \n \nRosiglitazone has been detected in the milk of experimental animals. It is not known whether breast-\nfeeding will lead to exposure of the infant to drug. Rosiglitazone should therefore not be used in \nwomen who are breast-feeding. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAVANDIA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nClinical trial data \n \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories \nassigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring \nduring normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100, \n< 1/10; and uncommon ≥ 1/1000, < 1/100. \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified from an overview of clinical trials involving over 5,000 \nrosiglitazone-treated patients.

The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with \nincrease in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol:HDLc was unchanged or improved \nin long term studies. Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually did not \nrequire discontinuation of treatment. \n \n2 An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment \nregimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg \nrosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose). The incidence of heart failure on triple \noral therapy was 1.4% in the main double blind study, compared to 0.4% for metformin plus \nsulphonylurea dual therapy. The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone \nadded to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%. Moreover in patients \nwith congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, a placebo-controlled one-year trial demonstrated \nworsening or possible worsening of heart failure in 6.4% of patients treated with rosiglitazone, \ncompared with 3.5% on placebo. \n \n3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of \nevents typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, \n2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% \nconfidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to \nestablished insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to \nthis retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were \nnot available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated \nwith cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% \nversus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a \nprospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of \ncardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR \n0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials \n(9,620 patients, study duration >3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other \napproved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of \ncardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are \ninconclusive. \n \n4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was \n9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or \n3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an \nincreased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to \nactive control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)]. The risk of fracture appeared to \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n8 \n\nbe higher in females relative to control [11.5% vs 6.3%, Risk ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.37 - 2.41)], than in \nmales relative to control [5.3% vs 4.3%, Risk ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.77)]. Additional data are \nnecessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of \nfollow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three \ntimes the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active \ncomparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver \nand biliary systems was < 1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo.  \n \nPost-marketing data \nIn addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented \nin Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone. Frequencies are defined as: rare \n≥1/10,000, <1/1000 and very rare <1/10,000 including isolated reports. \n \nTable 2.

In clinical studies in volunteers \nrosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well tolerated. \n \nIn the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment should be \ninitiated, as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Rosiglitazone is highly protein bound and is not \ncleared by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5.

It reduces \nglycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. \n \nPreclinical data \nThe antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models \nof type 2 diabetes. In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased \npancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in \nanimal models of type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or \ninduce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice. The major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high \naffinity to the soluble human PPARγ, exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in \nobese mouse. The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. \n \nClinical trials data \nThe glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with near maximal \nreductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of therapy. The \nimproved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and post-prandial glucose. \n \nRosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight. In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was \npredominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic \nfat. \n \nConsistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone reduced insulin resistance and improved \npancreatic ß-cell function. Improved glycaemic control was also associated with significant decreases \nin free fatty acids. As a consequence of different but complementary mechanisms of action, dual oral \ntherapy of rosiglitazone with a sulphonylurea or metformin resulted in additive effects on glycaemic \ncontrol in type 2 diabetic patients. \n \nIn studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily produced a \nsustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c). A more pronounced glucose-lowering \neffect was observed in obese patients. An outcome study has not been completed with rosiglitazone, \ntherefore the long-term benefits associated with improved glycaemic control have not been \ndemonstrated. \n \nAn active controlled clinical trial (rosiglitazone up to 8 mg daily or metformin up to 2,000 mg daily) \nof 24 weeks duration was performed in 197 children (10-17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. \nImprovement in HbA1c from baseline achieved statistical significance only in the metformin group. \nRosiglitazone failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to metformin. Following rosiglitazone treatment, \nthere were no new safety concerns noted in children compared to adult patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. No long-term efficacy and safety data are available in paediatric patients. \n \nADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with \na treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to \n8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) \nin 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed (≤3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone \ntreatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG>10.0 mmol/L) by 63% \nrelative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68, \nCI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a \ncumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% \nfor glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, \nglibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy \nfailure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular \noutcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were \nconsistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing \nweight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n10 \n\nwas seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycaemia in \nDiabetes) trial was a large (4,447 subjects), open-label, prospective, controlled study (mean follow-up \n5.5 years) in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin or \nsulphonylurea were randomised to add-on rosiglitazone or metformin or sulphonylurea. The mean \nduration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint \nwas cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular \ndeath. Mean doses at the end of randomised treatment are shown in the following table: \n \nRandomised Treatment† Mean (SD) dose at end of randomised treatment \nRosiglitazone (either SU or metformin) 6.7 (1.9) mg \nSulphonylurea (background metformin)  \n\nGlimepiride* 3.6 (1.8) mg \nMetformin (background sulphonylurea) 1995.5 (682.6) mg \n*Similar relative effective doses (i.e approximately half maximal dose) for other sulphonylureas \n(glibenclamide and glicazide). \n† Patients who took designated treatment as randomised in combination with the correct background \ntreatment and with evaluable data. \n \nNo difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) \nversus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined non-\ninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: \nall-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular \ndeath, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI \n0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In \na sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of \nsulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean \nreduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an \nincrease of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment \nwith randomised dual-combination therapy (p<0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean \nreduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, \nversus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, \n(p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and non-\nfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazone-\ncontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients \nwithdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and \n13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up \nand 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAbsolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately \n99%. Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 hour after dosing. Plasma concentrations \nare approximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.  \n \nAdministration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a \nsmall decrease in Cmax (approximately 20% to 28%) and a delay in tmax (ca.1.75 h) were observed \ncompared to dosing in the fasting state. These small changes are not clinically significant and, \ntherefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals. The \nabsorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 litres in healthy volunteers. Plasma \nprotein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration \nor age. The protein binding of the major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high (>99.99%). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nMetabolism \nMetabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged. The \nmajor routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with \nsulphate and glucuronic acid. The contribution of the major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) to the \noverall anti-diabetic activity of rosiglitazone has not been fully elucidated in man and it cannot be \nruled out that the metabolite may contribute to the activity. However, this raises no safety concern \nregarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase III \nclinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to moderate \nrenal impairment. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor \ncontribution by CYP2C9. \n \nSince there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with \nrosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances \nmetabolised by these P450 enzymes. Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 \n(IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5). An in vivo \ninteraction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates \nin vivo. \n \nElimination \nTotal plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of \nrosiglitazone is approximately 3 to 4 hours. There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of \nrosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing. The major route of excretion is the urine with \napproximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination \naccounts for approximately 25% of dose. No intact drug is excreted in urine or faeces. The terminal \nhalf-life for radioactivity was about 130 hours indicating that elimination of metabolites is very slow. \nAccumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially that of the \nmajor metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone between males and females. \n \nElderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was not found to influence the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone to any significant extent. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Population pharmacokinetic analysis including 96 paediatric patients aged \n10 to 18 years and weighing 35 to 178 kg suggested similar mean CL/F in children and adults. \nIndividual CL/F in the paediatric population was in the same range as individual adult data. CL/F \nseemed to be independent of age, but increased with weight in the paediatric population. \n \nHepatic impairment: In cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound \nCmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects. The inter-subject variability was \nlarge, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. \n \nRenal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \nrosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: An \nincrease in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart \nweight. Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed. Similar \neffects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was \nassociated with foetal death and retarded foetal development. In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited \novarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting \nin effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 \ntimes the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of \nthis finding is unknown. However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic \nchanges in human colon cancer cells in vitro. In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery \nof in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime \nstudies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRosiglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus:  \n \nas monotherapy \n– in patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for \n\nwhom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance \n \nas dual oral therapy in combination with \n– metformin, in patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control \n\ndespite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin \n– a sulphonylurea, only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is \n\ncontraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite monotherapy with a sulphonylurea \n \nas triple oral therapy in combination with \n– metformin and a sulphonylurea, in patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient \n\nglycaemic control despite dual oral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRosiglitazone therapy is usually initiated at 4 mg/day. This dose can be increased to 8 mg/day after \neight weeks if greater glycaemic control is required. In patients administered rosiglitazone in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea, an increase in rosiglitazone to 8 mg/day should be undertaken \ncautiously following appropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse \nreactions relating to fluid retention (see 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRosiglitazone may be given once or twice a day. \n \nRosiglitazone may be taken with or without food. \n \nElderly (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure) \nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n15 \n\nPatients with renal impairment (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure) \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiency. Limited data \nare available in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and \ntherefore rosiglitazone should be used with caution in these patients. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nRosiglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere are no data available on the use of rosiglitazone in patients under 10 years of age. For children \naged 10 to 17 years, there are limited data on rosiglitazone as monotherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \nThe available data do not support efficacy in the paediatric population and therefore such use is not \nrecommended. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nUse of rosiglitazone is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n− known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone or to any of the excipients  \n \n− cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA class I to IV) \n \n− an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) \n \n− hepatic impairment \n \n-  diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \nThiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention.  The possible \ncontribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive \nweight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those \nreceiving concurrent insulin or sulphonylurea therapy, those at risk for heart failure, and those with \nreduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions relating to \nfluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure. Increased monitoring of the patient is \nrecommended if rosiglitazone is used in combination with metformin and insulin. Rosiglitazone \nshould be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.  \n \n Heart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and \nheart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited \nexperience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs and rosiglitazone are associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. \n \nCombination with insulin \nAn increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is \nused in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic \nheart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases \nand under close supervision.  \n \nMyocardial Ischaemia \nA retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment \nwith rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n16 \n\nin their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8).  \nThere are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial \ndisease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, \nparticularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. \n \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) \nPatients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view \nof the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be \ninitiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute \nphase (see section 4.3). \n \nMonitoring of liver function \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience (see \nsection 4.8). There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated liver enzymes \n(ALT >2.5X upper limit of normal). Therefore, liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation \nof therapy with rosiglitazone in all patients and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgement. \nTherapy with rosiglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme \nlevels (ALT >2.5X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease. If ALT levels \nare increased to >3X upper limit of normal during rosiglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be \nreassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain >3X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be \ndiscontinued. If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include \nunexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes \nshould be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with rosiglitazone should \nbe guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, drug therapy \nshould be discontinued. \n \nEye disorders \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should \nbe considered. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater \nwhen used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it \nmay be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure.  \n \nAnaemia \nRosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels. In patients \nwith low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during \ntreatment with rosiglitazone. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nPatients receiving rosiglitazone in combination therapy with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, may be at \nrisk for dose-related hypoglycaemia. Increased monitoring of the patient and a reduction in the dose of \nthe concomitant agent may be necessary. \n \nTriple oral therapy \nThe use of rosiglitazone in triple oral therapy, in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea, \nmay be associated with increased risks for fluid retention and heart failure, as well as hypoglycaemia \n(see section 4.8). Increased monitoring of the patient is recommended and adjustment of the dose of \nsulphonylurea may be necessary. The decision to initiate triple oral therapy should include \nconsideration of the alternative to switch the patient to insulin. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n17 \n\nBone disorders \nLong-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper \nlimbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of \ntreatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the \ncare of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. \n \nOthers \nPremenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies. Although hormonal \nimbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects \nassociated with menstrual disorders have been observed. As a consequence of improving insulin \nsensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin \nresistance. Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become \npregnant or if pregnancy occurs the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). \n \nRosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min). \n \nRosiglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors \n(e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored closely. \nRosiglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment \nshould be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nAVANDIA tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with \nCYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.  \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold \nincrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of \ndose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of \nglycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease \nin rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The \nrosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n \nClinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated. \n \nConcomitant administration with the oral anti-diabetic agents metformin, glibenclamide and acarbose \ndid not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with rosiglitazone. Moderate \ningestion of alcohol with rosiglitazone has no effect on glycaemic control. \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 \nsubstrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with \nrosiglitazone. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nRosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rosiglitazone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n18 \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rosiglitazone \nshould not be used during pregnancy. \n \nRosiglitazone has been detected in the milk of experimental animals. It is not known whether breast-\nfeeding will lead to exposure of the infant to drug. Rosiglitazone should therefore not be used in \nwomen who are breast-feeding. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAVANDIA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nClinical trial data \n \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories \nassigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring \nduring normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100, \n< 1/10; and uncommon ≥ 1/1000, < 1/100. \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified from an overview of clinical trials involving over 5,000 \nrosiglitazone-treated patients. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in the \ntable by decreasing frequency for the rosiglitazone monotherapy treatment regimen. Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nTable 1.

The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with \nincrease in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol:HDLc was unchanged or improved \nin long term studies. Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually did not \nrequire discontinuation of treatment. \n \n2 An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment \nregimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg \nrosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose). The incidence of heart failure on triple \noral therapy was 1.4% in the main double blind study, compared to 0.4% for metformin plus \nsulphonylurea dual therapy. The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone \nadded to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%. Moreover in patients \nwith congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, a placebo-controlled one-year trial demonstrated \nworsening or possible worsening of heart failure in 6.4% of patients treated with rosiglitazone, \ncompared with 3.5% on placebo. \n \n3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of \nevents typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, \n2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% \nconfidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to \nestablished insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to \nthis retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were \nnot available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated \nwith cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% \nversus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a \nprospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of \ncardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR \n0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials \n(9,620 patients, study duration >3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other \napproved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of \ncardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are \ninconclusive. \n \n4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was \n9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or \n3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an \nincreased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to \nactive control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)]. The risk of fracture appeared to \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n20 \n\nbe higher in females relative to control [11.5% vs 6.3%, Risk ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.37 - 2.41)], than in \nmales relative to control [5.3% vs 4.3%, Risk ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.77)]. Additional data are \nnecessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of \nfollow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three \ntimes the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active \ncomparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver \nand biliary systems was < 1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo.  \n \nPost-marketing data \nIn addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented \nin Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone. Frequencies are defined as: rare \n≥1/10,000, <1/1000 and very rare <1/10,000 including isolated reports. \n \nTable 2.

In clinical studies in volunteers \nrosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well tolerated. \n \nIn the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment should be \ninitiated, as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Rosiglitazone is highly protein bound and is not \ncleared by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n21 \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: oral blood glucose lowering drugs, thiazolidinediones, ATC code: A10 \nBG 02 \n \nRosiglitazone is a selective agonist at the PPARγ (peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor gamma) \nnuclear receptor and is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic agents. It reduces \nglycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. \n \nPreclinical data \nThe antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models \nof type 2 diabetes. In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased \npancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in \nanimal models of type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or \ninduce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice. The major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high \naffinity to the soluble human PPARγ, exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in \nobese mouse. The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. \n \nClinical trials data \nThe glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with near maximal \nreductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of therapy. The \nimproved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and post-prandial glucose. \n \nRosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight. In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was \npredominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic \nfat. \n \nConsistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone reduced insulin resistance and improved \npancreatic ß-cell function. Improved glycaemic control was also associated with significant decreases \nin free fatty acids. As a consequence of different but complementary mechanisms of action, dual oral \ntherapy of rosiglitazone with a sulphonylurea or metformin resulted in additive effects on glycaemic \ncontrol in type 2 diabetic patients. \n \nIn studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily produced a \nsustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c). A more pronounced glucose-lowering \neffect was observed in obese patients. An outcome study has not been completed with rosiglitazone, \ntherefore the long-term benefits associated with improved glycaemic control have not been \ndemonstrated. \n \nAn active controlled clinical trial (rosiglitazone up to 8 mg daily or metformin up to 2,000 mg daily) \nof 24 weeks duration was performed in 197 children (10-17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. \nImprovement in HbA1c from baseline achieved statistical significance only in the metformin group. \nRosiglitazone failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to metformin. Following rosiglitazone treatment, \nthere were no new safety concerns noted in children compared to adult patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. No long-term efficacy and safety data are available in paediatric patients. \n \nADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with \na treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to \n8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) \nin 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed (≤3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone \ntreatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG>10.0 mmol/L) by 63% \nrelative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68, \nCI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a \ncumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% \nfor glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, \nglibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy \nfailure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular \noutcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were \nconsistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n22 \n\nweight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures \nwas seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycaemia in \nDiabetes) trial was a large (4,447 subjects), open-label, prospective, controlled study (mean follow-up \n5.5 years) in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin or \nsulphonylurea were randomised to add-on rosiglitazone or metformin or sulphonylurea. The mean \nduration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint \nwas cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular \ndeath. Mean doses at the end of randomised treatment are shown in the following table: \n \nRandomised Treatment† Mean (SD) dose at end of randomised treatment \nRosiglitazone (either SU or metformin) 6.7 (1.9) mg \nSulphonylurea (background metformin)  \n\nGlimepiride* 3.6 (1.8) mg \nMetformin (background sulphonylurea) 1995.5 (682.6) mg \n*Similar relative effective doses (i.e approximately half maximal dose) for other sulphonylureas \n(glibenclamide and glicazide). \n† Patients who took designated treatment as randomised in combination with the correct background \ntreatment and with evaluable data. \n \nNo difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) \nversus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined non-\ninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: \nall-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular \ndeath, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI \n0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In \na sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of \nsulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean \nreduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an \nincrease of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment \nwith randomised dual-combination therapy (p<0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean \nreduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, \nversus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, \n(p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and non-\nfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazone-\ncontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients \nwithdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and \n13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up \nand 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAbsolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately \n99%. Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 hour after dosing. Plasma concentrations \nare approximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.  \n \nAdministration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a \nsmall decrease in Cmax (approximately 20% to 28%) and a delay in tmax (ca.1.75 h) were observed \ncompared to dosing in the fasting state. These small changes are not clinically significant and, \ntherefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals. The \nabsorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 litres in healthy volunteers. Plasma \nprotein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n23 \n\nor age. The protein binding of the major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high (>99.99%). \n \nMetabolism \nMetabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged. The \nmajor routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with \nsulphate and glucuronic acid. The contribution of the major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) to the \noverall anti-diabetic activity of rosiglitazone has not been fully elucidated in man and it cannot be \nruled out that the metabolite may contribute to the activity. However, this raises no safety concern \nregarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase III \nclinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to moderate \nrenal impairment. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor \ncontribution by CYP2C9. \n \nSince there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with \nrosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances \nmetabolised by these P450 enzymes. Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 \n(IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5). An in vivo \ninteraction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates \nin vivo. \n \nElimination \nTotal plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of \nrosiglitazone is approximately 3 to 4 hours. There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of \nrosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing. The major route of excretion is the urine with \napproximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination \naccounts for approximately 25% of dose. No intact drug is excreted in urine or faeces. The terminal \nhalf-life for radioactivity was about 130 hours indicating that elimination of metabolites is very slow. \nAccumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially that of the \nmajor metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone between males and females. \n \nElderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was not found to influence the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone to any significant extent. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Population pharmacokinetic analysis including 96 paediatric patients aged \n10 to 18 years and weighing 35 to 178 kg suggested similar mean CL/F in children and adults. \nIndividual CL/F in the paediatric population was in the same range as individual adult data. CL/F \nseemed to be independent of age, but increased with weight in the paediatric population. \n \nHepatic impairment: In cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound \nCmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects. The inter-subject variability was \nlarge, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. \n \nRenal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \nrosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: An \nincrease in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart \nweight. Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed. Similar \neffects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was \nassociated with foetal death and retarded foetal development. In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited \novarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting \nin effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 \ntimes the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of \nthis finding is unknown. However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic \nchanges in human colon cancer cells in vitro. In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery \nof in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime \nstudies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRosiglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus:  \n \nas monotherapy \n– in patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for \n\nwhom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance \n \nas dual oral therapy in combination with \n– metformin, in patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control \n\ndespite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin \n– a sulphonylurea, only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is \n\ncontraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite monotherapy with a sulphonylurea \n \nas triple oral therapy in combination with \n– metformin and a sulphonylurea, in patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient \n\nglycaemic control despite dual oral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRosiglitazone therapy is usually initiated at 4 mg/day. This dose can be increased to 8 mg/day after \neight weeks if greater glycaemic control is required. In patients administered rosiglitazone in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea, an increase in rosiglitazone to 8 mg/day should be undertaken \ncautiously following appropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse \nreactions relating to fluid retention (see 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRosiglitazone may be given once or twice a day. \n \nRosiglitazone may be taken with or without food. \n \nElderly (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure) \nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n27 \n\nPatients with renal impairment (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure) \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiency. Limited data \nare available in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and \ntherefore rosiglitazone should be used with caution in these patients. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nRosiglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere are no data available on the use of rosiglitazone in patients under 10 years of age. For children \naged 10 to 17 years, there are limited data on rosiglitazone as monotherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \nThe available data do not support efficacy in the paediatric population and therefore such use is not \nrecommended. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nUse of rosiglitazone is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n− known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone or to any of the excipients  \n \n− cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA class I to IV) \n \n− an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) \n \n− hepatic impairment \n \n-  diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \nThiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention.  The possible \ncontribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive \nweight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those \nreceiving concurrent insulin or sulphonylurea therapy, those at risk for heart failure, and those with \nreduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions relating to \nfluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure. Increased monitoring of the patient is \nrecommended if rosiglitazone is used in combination with metformin and insulin.  Rosiglitazone \nshould be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.  \n \nHeart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and \nheart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited \nexperience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs and rosiglitazone are associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. \n \nCombination with insulin \nAn increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is \nused in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic \nheart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases \nand under close supervision. \n \nMyocardial Ischaemia \nA retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment \nwith rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n28 \n\nin their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8).  \nThere are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial \ndisease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, \nparticularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. \n \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) \nPatients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view \nof the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be \ninitiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute \nphase (see section 4.3). \n \nMonitoring of liver function \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience (see \nsection 4.8). There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated liver enzymes \n(ALT >2.5X upper limit of normal). Therefore, liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation \nof therapy with rosiglitazone in all patients and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgement. \nTherapy with rosiglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme \nlevels (ALT >2.5X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease. If ALT levels \nare increased to >3X upper limit of normal during rosiglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be \nreassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain >3X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be \ndiscontinued. If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include \nunexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes \nshould be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with rosiglitazone should \nbe guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, drug therapy \nshould be discontinued. \n \nEye disorders \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should \nbe considered. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater \nwhen used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it \nmay be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure.  \n \nAnaemia \nRosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels. In patients \nwith low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during \ntreatment with rosiglitazone. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nPatients receiving rosiglitazone in combination therapy with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, may be at \nrisk for dose-related hypoglycaemia. Increased monitoring of the patient and a reduction in the dose of \nthe concomitant agent may be necessary. \n \nTriple oral therapy \nThe use of rosiglitazone in triple oral therapy, in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea, \nmay be associated with increased risks for fluid retention and heart failure, as well as hypoglycaemia \n(see section 4.8). Increased monitoring of the patient is recommended and adjustment of the dose of \nsulphonylurea may be necessary. The decision to initiate triple oral therapy should include \nconsideration of the alternative to switch the patient to insulin. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n29 \n\nBone disorders \nLong-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper \nlimbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of \ntreatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the \ncare of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. \n \nOthers \nPremenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies. Although hormonal \nimbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects \nassociated with menstrual disorders have been observed. As a consequence of improving insulin \nsensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin \nresistance. Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become \npregnant or if pregnancy occurs the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). \n \nRosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min). \n \nRosiglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors \n(e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored closely. \nRosiglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment \nshould be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nAVANDIA tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with \nCYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.  \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold \nincrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of \ndose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of \nglycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease \nin rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The \nrosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n \nClinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated. \n \nConcomitant administration with the oral anti-diabetic agents metformin, glibenclamide and acarbose \ndid not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with rosiglitazone. Moderate \ningestion of alcohol with rosiglitazone has no effect on glycaemic control. \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 \nsubstrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with \nrosiglitazone. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nRosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rosiglitazone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n30 \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rosiglitazone \nshould not be used during pregnancy. \n \nRosiglitazone has been detected in the milk of experimental animals. It is not known whether breast-\nfeeding will lead to exposure of the infant to drug. Rosiglitazone should therefore not be used in \nwomen who are breast-feeding. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAVANDIA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nClinical trial data \n \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories \nassigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring \nduring normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100, \n< 1/10; and uncommon ≥ 1/1000, < 1/100. \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified from an overview of clinical trials involving over 5,000 \nrosiglitazone-treated patients. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in the \ntable by decreasing frequency for the rosiglitazone monotherapy treatment regimen. Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nTable 1.

The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with \nincrease in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol:HDLc was unchanged or improved \nin long term studies. Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually did not \nrequire discontinuation of treatment. \n \n2 An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment \nregimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg \nrosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose). The incidence of heart failure on triple \noral therapy was 1.4% in the main double blind study, compared to 0.4% for metformin plus \nsulphonylurea dual therapy. The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone \nadded to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%. Moreover in patients \nwith congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, a placebo-controlled one-year trial demonstrated \nworsening or possible worsening of heart failure in 6.4% of patients treated with rosiglitazone, \ncompared with 3.5% on placebo. \n \n3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of \nevents typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, \n2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% \nconfidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to \nestablished insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to \nthis retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were \nnot available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated \nwith cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% \nversus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a \nprospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of \ncardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR \n0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials \n(9,620 patients, study duration >3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other \napproved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of \ncardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are \ninconclusive. \n \n4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was \n9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or \n3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an \nincreased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to \nactive control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)].

Additional data are \nnecessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of \nfollow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three \ntimes the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active \ncomparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver \nand biliary systems was < 1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo.  \n \nPost-marketing data \nIn addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented \nin Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone. Frequencies are defined as: rare \n≥1/10,000, <1/1000 and very rare <1/10,000 including isolated reports. \n \nTable 2.

In very rare \ncases a fatal outcome has been reported. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited data are available with regard to overdose in humans. In clinical studies in volunteers \nrosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well tolerated. \n \nIn the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment should be \ninitiated, as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Rosiglitazone is highly protein bound and is not \ncleared by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5.

It reduces \nglycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. \n \nPreclinical data \nThe antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models \nof type 2 diabetes. In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased \npancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in \nanimal models of type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or \ninduce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice. The major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high \naffinity to the soluble human PPARγ, exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in \nobese mouse. The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. \n \nClinical trials data \nThe glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with near maximal \nreductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of therapy. The \nimproved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and post-prandial glucose. \n \nRosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight. In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was \npredominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic \nfat. \n \nConsistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone reduced insulin resistance and improved \npancreatic ß-cell function. Improved glycaemic control was also associated with significant decreases \nin free fatty acids. As a consequence of different but complementary mechanisms of action, dual oral \ntherapy of rosiglitazone with a sulphonylurea or metformin resulted in additive effects on glycaemic \ncontrol in type 2 diabetic patients. \nIn studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily produced a \nsustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c). A more pronounced glucose-lowering \neffect was observed in obese patients. An outcome study has not been completed with rosiglitazone, \ntherefore the long-term benefits associated with improved glycaemic control have not been \ndemonstrated. \n \nAn active controlled clinical trial (rosiglitazone up to 8 mg daily or metformin up to 2,000 mg daily) \nof 24 weeks duration was performed in 197 children (10-17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. \nImprovement in HbA1c from baseline achieved statistical significance only in the metformin group. \nRosiglitazone failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to metformin. Following rosiglitazone treatment, \nthere were no new safety concerns noted in children compared to adult patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. No long-term efficacy and safety data are available in paediatric patients. \n \nADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with \na treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to \n8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) \nin 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed (≤3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone \ntreatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG>10.0 mmol/L) by 63% \nrelative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68, \nCI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a \ncumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% \nfor glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, \nglibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy \nfailure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular \noutcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were \nconsistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing \nweight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures \nwas seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nThe RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycaemia in \nDiabetes) trial was a large (4,447 subjects), open-label, prospective, controlled study (mean follow-up \n5.5 years) in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin or \nsulphonylurea were randomised to add-on rosiglitazone or metformin or sulphonylurea. The mean \nduration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint \nwas cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular \ndeath. Mean doses at the end of randomised treatment are shown in the following table: \n \nRandomised Treatment† Mean (SD) dose at end of randomised treatment \nRosiglitazone (either SU or metformin) 6.7 (1.9) mg \nSulphonylurea (background metformin)  \n\nGlimepiride* 3.6 (1.8) mg \nMetformin (background sulphonylurea) 1995.5 (682.6) mg \n*Similar relative effective doses (i.e approximately half maximal dose) for other sulphonylureas \n(glibenclamide and glicazide). \n† Patients who took designated treatment as randomised in combination with the correct background \ntreatment and with evaluable data. \n \nNo difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) \nversus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined non-\ninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: \nall-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular \ndeath, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI \n0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In \na sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of \nsulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean \nreduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an \nincrease of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment \nwith randomised dual-combination therapy (p<0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean \nreduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, \nversus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, \n(p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and non-\nfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazone-\ncontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients \nwithdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and \n13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up \nand 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAbsolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately \n99%. Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 hour after dosing. Plasma concentrations \nare approximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.  \n \nAdministration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a \nsmall decrease in Cmax (approximately 20% to 28%) and a delay in tmax (ca.1.75 h) were observed \ncompared to dosing in the fasting state. These small changes are not clinically significant and, \ntherefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals. The \nabsorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 litres in healthy volunteers. Plasma \nprotein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration \nor age. The protein binding of the major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high (>99.99%). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n35 \n\nMetabolism \nMetabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged. The \nmajor routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with \nsulphate and glucuronic acid. The contribution of the major metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) to the \noverall anti-diabetic activity of rosiglitazone has not been fully elucidated in man and it cannot be \nruled out that the metabolite may contribute to the activity. However, this raises no safety concern \nregarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase III \nclinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to moderate \nrenal impairment. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor \ncontribution by CYP2C9. \n \nSince there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with \nrosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances \nmetabolised by these P450 enzymes. Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 \n(IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5). An in vivo \ninteraction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates \nin vivo. \n \nElimination \nTotal plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of \nrosiglitazone is approximately 3 to 4 hours. There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of \nrosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing. The major route of excretion is the urine with \napproximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination \naccounts for approximately 25% of dose. No intact drug is excreted in urine or faeces. The terminal \nhalf-life for radioactivity was about 130 hours indicating that elimination of metabolites is very slow. \nAccumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially that of the \nmajor metabolite (para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone between males and females. \n \nElderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was not found to influence the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone to any significant extent. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Population pharmacokinetic analysis including 96 paediatric patients aged \n10 to 18 years and weighing 35 to 178 kg suggested similar mean CL/F in children and adults. \nIndividual CL/F in the paediatric population was in the same range as individual adult data. CL/F \nseemed to be independent of age, but increased with weight in the paediatric population. \n \nHepatic impairment: In cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound \nCmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects. The inter-subject variability was \nlarge, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. \n \nRenal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \nrosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: An \nincrease in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart \nweight. Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed. Similar \neffects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n36 \n\nassociated with foetal death and retarded foetal development. In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited \novarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting \nin effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 \ntimes the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of \nthis finding is unknown. However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic \nchanges in human colon cancer cells in vitro. In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery \nof in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime \nstudies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species. \n \n \n6.

WHAT AVANDIA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nAvandia is used to treat type 2 diabetes.  People with type 2 diabetes either don’t make enough \ninsulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar levels), or don’t respond normally to the insulin their \nbody makes.  Avandia helps to reduce your blood sugar towards a normal level, by helping your body \nmake better use of the insulin it produces. \n \nAvandia can be used alone or in combination with other medicines to treat diabetes (such as \nmetformin or a sulphonylurea). \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE AVANDIA \n \nTo help manage your diabetes, it is important that you follow any diet and lifestyle advice from your \ndoctor as well as taking Avandia. \n \nDon’t take Avandia: \n\n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to rosiglitazone or any of the other ingredients of \nAvandia (listed in Section 6) \n\n• if you have had a heart attack or severe angina, that’s being treated in hospital \n• if you have heart failure, or have had heart failure in the past \n• if you have liver disease \n• if you have had diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes causing rapid weight \n\nloss, nausea or vomiting) \n\n     Check with your doctor if you think any of these apply to you. Don’t take Avandia. \n \nTake special care with Avandia \n \nAvandia is not recommended for people aged under 18, as the effectiveness in children has not \nbeen shown. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n54 \n\nIf you have been diagnosed with angina (chest pain), or peripheral arterial disease (reduced blood \nflow to the legs): \n\n     Check with your doctor, as Avandia may not be suitable for you. \n \nConditions to look out for \nAvandia and other medicines for diabetes can make some existing conditions worse, or cause serious \nside effects.  You must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking Avandia, to reduce the risk \nof any problems. See ‘Conditions you need to look out for’ in Section 4. \n \nOvulation may restart \nWomen who are infertile due to a condition affecting their ovaries (such as Polycystic Ovarian \nSyndrome), may start ovulating again when they start taking Avandia. If this applies to you, use \nappropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy (see ‘Pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding’ later in Section 2).  \n \nTaking other medicines \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, if you’ve taken any recently, or \nif you start taking new ones. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you bought without a \nprescription.   \n \nCertain medicines are especially likely to affect the amount of sugar in your blood:  \n• gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol) \n• rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) \n\n Tell a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, \nand your dose of Avandia may need to be changed. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n• Avandia is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or could be pregnant, tell \n\nyour doctor. \n \n• Don’t breast-feed while you are taking Avandia. The ingredients may pass into breast milk and so \n\nmay harm your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine should not affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nAvandia contains lactose  \nAvandia tablets contain a small amount of lactose. Patients who are intolerant to lactose or have a rare \nhereditary problem of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO TAKE AVANDIA \n \nAlways take Avandia tablets exactly as your doctor has told you. Do not take more than the \nrecommended dose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nHow much to take \nThe usual starting dose is 4 mg a day.  This can be taken as one 4 mg tablet once a day, or as one \n2 mg tablet taken twice a day. \n \nAfter about 8 weeks your doctor may need to increase your dose. The maximum dose is 8 mg of \nAvandia a day. \n \nHow to take \nSwallow the tablets with some water. You can take Avandia with or without food. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n55 \n\n \nTake your tablets around the same time every day and follow any dietary advice that your doctor has \ngiven you. \n \nIf you take more Avandia than you should  \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.  \n \nIf you forget to take Avandia \nDon’t take extra tablets to make up for a missed dose. Just take your next dose at the usual time.  \n \nDon’t stop taking Avandia \nTake Avandia for as long as your doctor recommends. If you stop taking Avandia, your blood sugar \nwill not be controlled, and you may become unwell. Talk to your doctor if you want to stop. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Avandia can cause side effects, but not everybody gets them. \n \nConditions you need to look out for \n \nAllergic reactions: These are very rare in people taking Avandia. Signs include: \n• raised and itchy rash (hives) \n• swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n• collapse. \n Contact a doctor immediately if you get any of these symptoms. Stop taking Avandia. \n\n \nFluid retention and heart failure: Avandia can cause you to retain water (fluid retention) which \nleads to swelling and weight gain.  Extra body fluid can make some existing heart problems worse or \nlead to heart failure. This is more likely if you are also taking other medicines for your diabetes (like \ninsulin), if you have kidney problems, or if you are over 65. Check your weight regularly; if it goes \nup rapidly, tell your doctor. Symptoms of heart failure include:  \n• shortness of breath, waking up short of breath at night \n• getting tired easily after light physical activity such as walking \n• rapid increase in your weight \n• swollen ankles or feet. \n\n Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get any of these symptoms - either for the first time or \nif they get worse. \n\n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia): If you are taking Avandia with other medicines for diabetes, it is \nmore likely that your blood sugar could fall below the normal level. Early symptoms of low blood \nsugar are: \n shaking, sweating, faintness \n nervousness, palpitations  \n hunger.  \n\nThe severity can increase, leading to confusion and loss of consciousness.  \n Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get any of these symptoms. The dose of your \nmedicines may need to be reduced.  \n\n \nLiver problems: Before you start taking Avandia you will have a blood sample taken to check your \nliver function. This check may be repeated at intervals. These may be signs of liver problems: \n• nausea and vomiting  \n• stomach (abdominal) pain \n• loss of appetite \n• dark-coloured urine.  \n\n Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get these symptoms. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n56 \n\n \nEye problems: Swelling of the retina at the back of the eye which can cause blurred vision (macular \noedema) can be a problem for people with diabetes. New or worse cases of macular oedema have \noccurred on rare occasions in people taking Avandia and similar medicines.   \n\n Discuss with your doctor any concerns about your eyesight.   \n \nBroken bones: Bone fractures can occur in people with diabetes. The chances of this happening may \nbe higher in people, particularly women, taking Avandia for more than one year. The most common \nare breaks in feet, hands and arms. \n \nCommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people:  \n\n• chest pain (angina) \n• broken bones  \n• reduction in blood count (anaemia) \n• small increases in blood cholesterol, increased amount of fats in the blood  \n• increased weight, increased appetite  \n• constipation \n• swelling (oedema) due to water retention. \n\n \nRare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people:  \n\n• fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) causing breathlessness  \n• heart failure  \n• swelling of the retina at the back of the eye (macular oedema)  \n• liver doesn’t function as well as it should (increase in liver enzymes).  \n\n \nVery rare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people:  \n\n• allergic reactions \n• rapid and excessive weight gain caused by fluid retention. \n\nIf you get side effects \n Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed gets severe or troublesome, or if \n\nyou notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE AVANDIA \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children.  \n \nDo not use Avandia after the expiry date shown on the pack. \n \nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nIf you have any unwanted tablets, don’t put them in waste water or household rubbish. Ask your \npharmacist how to dispose of tablets you don’t need. This will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n57 \n\n6.
