The first injection of Nordimet should be performed under direct medical supervision. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nImportant warning about the dosage of Nordimet \n\nIn the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis,psoriasis and psoriatic \n\narthritis requiring dosing once a week. Nordimet must only be used once a week. Dosage errors in \n\nthe use of Nordimet can result in serious adverse reactions, including death. Please read this section \n\nof the summary of product characteristics very carefully. \n\n \n\nWhen switching from oral use to subcutaneous use, a reduction in the dose may be required, due to \n\nthe variable bioavailability of methotrexate after oral administration. \n \nFolic acid or folinic acid supplementation may be considered in accordance with current therapeutic \nguidelines. \n\n \n\nThe overall duration of treatment is decided by the doctor. \n \nPosology \n \nDosage in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe recommended initial dose is 7.5 mg of methotrexate once weekly, administered \nsubcutaneously. Depending on the individual activity of the disease and patient tolerability, the \n\ninitial dose may be increased. A weekly dose of 25 mg should in general not be exceeded. However, \n\ndoses exceeding 20 mg per week can be associated with significant increase in toxicity, especially \nbone marrow suppression. Response to treatment can be expected after approximately 4-8 weeks. \n\nOnce the desired therapeutic result has been achieved, the dose should be reduced gradually to the \n\nlowest possible effective maintenance dose. Symptoms may return after treatment discontinuation. \n \nMethotrexate treatment of rheumatoid arthritis represents long-term treatment. \n \nDosage in patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis \nIt is recommended that a test dose of 5-10 mg be administered subcutaneously one week prior to \n\ninitiation of therapy, in order to detect idiosyncratic adverse effects. The recommended initial dose \nis 7.5 mg methotrexate once weekly. The dose is to be increased gradually but should not, in \n\ngeneral, exceed a weekly dose of 25 mg of methotrexate. Doses exceeding 20 mg per week can be \n\nassociated with significant increase in toxicity, especially bone marrow suppression. Response to \ntreatment can generally be expected after approximately 2-6 weeks. Depending on the clinical \n\npicture and the changes of laboratory parameters, the therapy is then continued or discontinued. \n \nOnce the desired therapeutic result has been achieved, dose should be reduced gradually to the \nlowest possible effective maintenance dose. In a few exceptional cases a higher dose than 25 mg \n\nmight be clinically justified, but should not exceed a maximum weekly dose of 30 mg of \n\nmethotrexate as toxicity will markedly increase. \n \nMethotrexate treatment of severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis represents long-term \ntreatment. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nDose reduction should be considered in elderly patients due to reduced liver and kidney function as \n\nwell as lower folate reserves which occur with increased age (see sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 or 5.2) \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nRenal impairment \nMethotrexate should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). The dose should be adjusted as follows: \n \n\nCreatinine clearance (ml/min) Dose \n\n\u2265 60 100 % \n\n30-59 50 % \n\n< 30 Nordimet must not be used \n\n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nMethotrexate should be administered with great caution, if at all, to patients with significant current \n\nor previous liver disease, especially when caused by alcohol. Methotrexate is contraindicated if \n\nbilirubin values are > 5 mg/dl (85.5 \u00b5mol/L) (see section 4.3). \n \nUse in patient with a third distribution space (pleural effusions, ascitis) \nAs the half-life of methotrexate can be prolonged to 4 times the normal length in patients who \n\npossess a third distribution space, dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate \n\nadministration may be required (see sections 5.2 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nDosage in children and adolescents below 16 years with polyarthritic forms of juvenile idiopathic \narthritis \nThe recommended dose is 10-15 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area (BSA) per week.  \n\nIn therapy-refractory cases the weekly dose may be increased up to 20 mg/m\u00b2 BSA per week. \nHowever, an increased monitoring frequency is indicated if the dose is increased. Parenteral \n\nadministration is limited to subcutaneous injection. Patients with JIA should always be referred to a \n\nrheumatology unit specializing in the treatment of children/adolescents. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Nordimet in children < 3 years of age have not been established (see \nsection 4.4). No data available. \n \nMethod of administration \nIt must be explicitly pointed out to the patient that Nordimet is applied only once a week. It is \nrecommended to specify a certain day of the week as \u201cday for injection\u201d.  \n \nNordimet is for subcutaneous use (see section 6.6.).  \n \nThe medicinal product is for single use only. The solution is to be visually inspected prior to use. \nOnly clear solutions practically free from particles should be used. \nAny contact of methotrexate with skin and mucosa is to be avoided. In case of contamination, the \n\naffected parts are to be rinsed immediately with plenty of water (see section 6.6). \n \nPlease refer to the patient information leaflet for instructions on how to use the pre-filled pen or pre-\n\nfilled syringe. \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Severe hepatic impairment, if serum if bilirubin is > 5 mg/dl (85.5 \u00b5mol/l) (see section 4.2). \n- Alcohol abuse. \n- Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n- Pre-existing blood dyscrasias, such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, \n\nthrombocytopenia or significant anaemia. \n- Immunodeficiency. \n- Serious, acute or chronic infections such as tuberculosis and HIV. \n- Stomatitis, ulcers of the oral cavity and known active gastrointestinal ulcer disease. \n- Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n- Concurrent vaccination with live vaccines. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients must be clearly advised that the therapy is to be administered once a week, and not every \n\nday. Incorrect administration of methotrexate can lead to severe, including potentially lethal adverse \nreactions. Healthcare professionals and patients should be clearly instructed. \n \nPatients receiving therapy should be appropriately monitored, so that signs of possible toxic effects \n\nor adverse reactions can be recognised and assessed without delay. Hence, methotrexate should be \nonly administered by, or under the supervision of, doctors whose knowledge and experience include \n\nthe use of antimetabolite therapy. \nDue to the risk of severe or even fatal toxic reactions, patients should be thoroughly informed by the \n\ndoctor about the risks (including early signs and symptoms of toxicity) and recommended safety \nmeasures. They are to be informed about the necessity to immediately consult the physician if \n\nsymptoms of intoxication occur, as well as about the subsequent necessary monitoring of symptoms \n\nof intoxication (including regular laboratory tests). \nDoses exceeding 20 mg/week can be associated with significant increase in toxicity, especially bone \n\nmarrow suppression. \n \nSkin and mucosal contact with methotrexate is to be avoided. In the case of contamination, the parts \n\nconcerned should be rinsed with plenty of water. \n\n \nFertility and reproduction \n\n \nFertility \n\nMethotrexate has been reported to cause oligospermia, menstrual dysfunction and amenorrhoea in \n\nhumans, during and for a short period after cessation of therapy, and to cause impaired fertility, \naffecting spermatogenesis and oogenesis during the period of its administration - effects that appear \n\nto be reversible on discontinuing therapy.  \n\n \nTeratogenicity \u2013 Reproductive risk \n\nMethotrexate causes embryotoxicity, abortion and foetal defects in humans. Therefore, the possible \n\nrisks of effects on reproduction, pregnancy loss and congenital malformations should be discussed \n\nwith female patients of childbearing potential (see section 4.6). The absence of pregnancy must be \nconfirmed before Nordimet is used. If women of a sexually mature age are treated, effective \n\ncontraception must be performed during treatment and for at least six months after.  \n\n \nFor contraception advice for men, see section 4.6. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nRecommended examinations and safety measures \n \nBefore initiating therapy or upon resuming therapy after a rest period \nComplete blood count with differential blood count and platelets, liver enzymes, bilirubin, serum \n\nalbumin, chest X-ray and renal function tests must be conducted. If clinically indicated, exclude \n\ntuberculosis and hepatitis. \n \nDuring therapy \n\nThe tests below must be conducted every week during  the first two weeks, then every two weeks \n\nfor the next month; afterwards, depending on leukocyte count and stability of the patient, at least \nonce monthly during the next six months and at least every three months thereafter. \nIncreased monitoring frequency should also be considered when increasing the dose. Particularly \n\nelderly patients should be examined for early signs of toxicity in short intervals. \n \n- Examination of the oral cavity and throat for mucosal changes. \n\n \n- Complete blood count with differential blood count and platelets. \n\nHaematopoietic suppression induced by methotrexate may occur abruptly and at apparently \n\nsafe doses. In the event of any significant drop in leukocytes or platelets, treatment must be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate supportive therapy instituted. Patients must be \ninstructed to report all signs and symptoms suggestive of infection. In patients concomitantly \n\ntaking haematotoxic medicinal products (e.g. leflunomide), the blood count and platelets \n\nshould be closely monitored.  \n\n \n- Liver function tests. \n\nParticular attention should be paid to the onset of liver toxicity. Treatment should not be \n\ninitiated or should be discontinued if there are any abnormalities in liver function tests or \n\nliver biopsies, or if these develop during therapy. Such abnormalities should return to normal \nwithin two weeks; after which, treatment may be resumed at the discretion of the doctor. \n\n \nTemporary increases in transaminases to two or three times the upper limit of normal have \n\nbeen reported in patients at a frequency of 13-20 %. Persistent anomalies of liver-related \n\nenzymes and/or decrease in serum albumin may be indicative for severe hepatotoxicity. \n \n\nEnzyme diagnostics does not allow any reliable prediction of the development of a \n\nmorphologically detectable hepatotoxicity, i.e. even in case of normal transaminases, hepatic \n\nfibrosis only histologically identifiable or, more rarely, also hepatocirrhosis may be present. \n \n\nIn rheumatological indications, there is no evidence to support use of liver biopsies in \n\nmonitoring hepatotoxicity. For psoriasis patients the need of a liver biopsy prior to and during \n\ntherapy is controversial. Further research is needed to establish whether serial liver chemistry \ntests or propeptide of type III collagen can detect hepatotoxicity sufficiently. This assessment \n\nshould differentiate between patients without any risk factors and patients with risk factors, \n\ne.g. excessive prior alcohol consumption, persistent elevation of liver enzymes, history of \nliver disease, family history of hereditary liver disorders, diabetes mellitus, obesity and \n\nprevious contact with hepatotoxic medicinal products or chemicals and prolonged \n\nmethotrexate treatment or cumulative doses of 1.5 g or more. \n \n\nIn the event of a constant increase in liver-related enzymes, consideration should be given to \nreducing the dose or discontinuing therapy. \n\n \nDue to the potentially toxic effect on the liver, additional hepatotoxic medicinal products \n\nshould not be given during treatment with methotrexate unless clearly necessary and alcohol \nconsumption should be avoided or greatly reduced (see section 4.5). Closer monitoring of \n\nliver enzymes should be undertaken in patients concomitantly taking other hepatotoxic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. leflunomide). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nIncreased caution should generally be exercised in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes \n\nmellitus, as during methotrexate therapy hepatocirrhosis developed in isolated cases without \nintermittent increase in transaminases. \n\n \n- Renal function should be monitored via renal function tests and urinanalysis (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.3). If serum creatinine is increased, the dose should be reduced. As methotrexate is \npredominantly excreted via the renal route, increased concentrations can be expected in cases \n\nof renal impairment, which may result in severe adverse reactions. In cases of possible renal \n\nimpairment (e.g. in elderly patients), closer monitoring is required. This particularly applies \n\nto the co-administration of medicinal products which affect methotrexate excretion, cause \nkidney damage (e.g. NSAIDs) or can potentially lead to haematopoietic disorders. In patients \n\nwith impaired renal function, concomitant administration of NSAIDs is not recommended. \n\nDehydration may also potentiate the toxicity of methotrexate. \n \n- Assessment of respiratory system. \n\nQuestioning the patient with regard to possible pulmonary dysfunctions, if necessary lung \n\nfunction test. Acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis, often associated with blood \n\neosinophilia, may occur and deaths have been reported. Symptoms typically include \ndyspnoea, cough (especially a dry non-productive cough), thoracic pain and fever for which \n\npatients should be monitored at each follow-up visit. Patients should be informed of the risk \n\nof pneumonitis and advised to contact their doctor immediately should they develop \npersistent cough or dyspnoea.  \n\n \n\nIn addition, pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage has been reported with methotrexate used in \n\nrheumatologic and related indications. This event may also be associated with vasculitis and \nother comorbidities. Prompt investigations should be considered when pulmonary alveolar \n\nhaemorrhage is suspected to confirm the diagnosis. \n \n Methotrexate should be discontinued in patients with pulmonary symptoms and a thorough \n\ninvestigation (including chest x-ray) should be made to exclude infection and tumours. If \n\nmethotrexate induced lung disease is suspected, treatment with corticosteroids should be \n\ninitiated and treatment with methotrexate should not be restarted. \n \n\nPulmonary diseases induced by methotrexate were not always completely reversible. \n \n\nPulmonary symptoms require a quick diagnosis and discontinuation of methotrexate therapy. \n\nPulmonary diseases induced by methotrexate, like pneumonitis, can occur acutely at any time \nof therapy, they were not always completely reversible and have been reported already at all \n\ndoses (inclusive low doses of 7.5 mg/week). \n\n \n\nDuring methotrexate therapy, opportunistic infection can occur including pneumocystis \njiroveci pneumonia, which may take a lethal course. If a patient presents with pulmonary \n\nsymptoms, the possibility of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia should be taken into account. \n \n\nSpecial caution is required in patients with impaired pulmonary function. \n \n- Methotrexate may, due to its effect on the immune system, impair the response to \n\nvaccinations and interfere with the result of immunological tests. Concurrent vaccination \n\nusing live vaccines must not be carried out. \n\n \nParticular caution should be exercised in the presence of inactive, chronic infections (e.g. \n\nherpes zoster, tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C) due to possible activation. \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nMalignant lymphomas may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate; in which case, \n\nmethotrexate must be discontinued. If lymphomas should fail to regress spontaneously, initiation of \ncytotoxic therapy is required. \nIn patients with pathological accumulation of liquid in body cavities (\u201cthird space\u201d), such as ascites \n\nor pleural effusions, the plasma elimination half-life of methotrexate is prolonged. Pleural effusions \nand ascites should be drained prior to initiation of methotrexate treatment. \n \nConditions leading to dehydration such as emesis, diarrhoea or stomatitis, can increase the toxicity \n\nof methotrexate due to elevated levels of the active substance. In these cases use of methotrexate \n\nshould be interrupted until the symptoms cease. \n \nVitamin preparations or other products containing folic acid, folinic acid or their derivatives may \n\ndecrease the effectiveness of methotrexate. \n  \nRadiation induced dermatitis and sun-burn can reappear under methotrexate therapy \n(recall-reaction). Psoriatic lesions can exacerbate during UV-irradiation and simultaneous \n\nadministration of methotrexate. \n \nConcomitant administration of folate antagonists such as trimethoprim /sulphamethoxazole has \nbeen reported to cause an acute megaloblastic pancytopenia in rare instances. \n \nEncephalopathy / Leukoencephalopathy have been reported in oncologic patients receiving \n\nmethotrexate therapy and cannot be excluded for methotrexate therapy in non-oncologic \nindications. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201c. \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn animal experiments non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including salicylic acid \ncaused reduction of tubular methotrexate secretion and consequently increased its toxic effects. \n\nHowever, in clinical studies, where NSAIDs and salicylic acid were given as concomitant medicinal \n\nproducts to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, no increase of adverse reactions was observed. \n\nTreatment of rheumatoid arthritis with such drugs can be continued during low-dose methotrexate \ntherapy but only under close medical supervision. \nRegular alcohol consumption and administration of additional hepatotoxic medicinal products \n\nincrease the probability of hepatotoxic effects of methotrexate. \nPatients taking potentially hepatotoxic and haematoxic medicinal products during methotrexate \n\ntherapy (e.g. leflunomide, azathioprine, sulphasalazine, and retinoids) should be closely monitored \n\nfor possibly increased hepatotoxicity. Alcohol consumption must be avoided during treatment with \n\nmethotrexate. \n \nAdministration of additional haematotoxic medicinal products (e.g. metamizole) increases the \n\nprobability of severe haematoxic effects of methotrexate. \n \nOne should be aware of pharmacokinetic interactions between methotrexate, anticonvulsant \nmedicinal products (reduced methotrexate blood levels), and 5-fluorouracil (increased t\u00bd of \n\n5--fluorouracil).  \n\nSalicylates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, barbiturates, tranquillisers, oral contraceptives, \ntetracyclines, amidopyrine derivatives, sulfonamides and p-aminobenzoic acid displace \n\nmethotrexate from serum albumin binding and thus increase bioavailability (indirect dose increase).  \n\nProbenecid and mild organic acids may also reduce tubular methotrexate secretion, and thus cause \nindirect dose elevations, too. \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nAntibiotics, like penicillin, glycopeptides, sulfonamides, ciprofloxacin and cefalotin can, in \n\nindividual cases, reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate, so that increased serum concentrations \nof methotrexate with simultaneous haematological and gastro-intestinal toxicity may occur. \n \nOral antibiotics such as tetracyclines, chloramphenicol and non-absorbable broad-spectrum \n\nantibiotics may reduce intestinal methotrexate absorption or interfere with the enterohepatic \ncirculation, due to inhibition of the intestinal flora or suppression of bacterial metabolism. \n \nUnder (pre-)treatment with substances that may have adverse effects on the bone marrow (e.g. \n\nsulphonamides, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, pyrimethamine), the possibility \nof marked haematopoietic disorders should be considered. \n \nCo-administration of medicinal products which cause folate deficiency (e.g. sulphonamides, \n\ntrimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole) can lead to increased methotrexate toxicity. Particular caution \n\nshould therefore also be exercised in the presence of existing folic acid deficiency. \nOn the other hand, concomitant administration of folinic acid containing drugs or of vitamin \n\npreparations, which contain folic acid or derivatives, may impair methotrexate efficacy. \n \nA rise in the toxicity of methotrexate is generally not anticipated when methotrexate is used \nconcomitantly with other antirheumatic agents (e.g. gold compounds, penicillamine, \n\nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, cyclosporin). \n \nThough the combination of methotrexate and sulfasalazine may enhance methotrexate efficacy by \nsulfasalazine related inhibition of folic acid synthesis, and thus may lead to an increased risk of \n\nadverse reactions, these were only observed in single patients within several trials. \n \nCo-administration of proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole or pantoprazole can lead to \ninteractions: concomitant administration of methotrexate and omeprazole has led to a delay in the \n\nrenal elimination of methotrexate. In combination with pantoprazole, inhibited renal elimination of \n\nthe 7-hydroxymethotrexate metabolite, with myalgia and shivering, was reported in one case. \n \nMethotrexate may reduce theophylline clearance. Therefore, theophylline blood levels should be \n\nmonitored under concomitant methotrexate administration. \n \nExcessive consumption of beverages containing caffeine or theophylline (coffee, soft drinks \n\ncontaining caffeine, black tea) should be avoided during methotrexate therapy since the efficacy of \nmethotrexate may be reduced due to possible interaction between methotrexate and \n\nmethylxanthines at adenosine receptors. \nThe combined use of methotrexate and leflunomide may increase the risk for pancytopenia. \nMethotrexate leads to increased plasma levels of mercaptopurines. Therefore, the combination of \n\nthese may require dose adjustment. \n \nParticularly in the case of orthopaedic surgery where susceptibility to infection is high, a \ncombination of methotrexate with immune-modulating medicinal products must be used with \n\ncaution. \n\n \n\nThe use of nitrous oxide potentiates the effect of methotrexate on folate metabolism, yielding \nincreased toxicity such as severe unpredictable myelosuppression and stomatitis. Whilst this effect \n\ncan be reduced by administering calcium folinate, the concomitant use of nitrous oxide and \n\nmethotrexate should be avoided. \n \nColestyramine can increase the non-renal elimination of methotrexate by interrupting the \n\nenterohepatic circulation. Delayed methotrexate clearance should be considered in combination \n\nwith other cytostatic medicinal products. Radiotherapy during use of methotrexate can increase the \nrisk of soft tissue or bone necrosis.  \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nOn account of its possible effect on the immune system, methotrexate can falsify vaccinal and test \n\nresults (immunological procedures to record the immune reaction). During methotrexate therapy \nconcurrent vaccination with live vaccines must not be carried out (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / contraception in females \nWomen must not get pregnant during methotrexate therapy, and effective contraception must be \n\nused during treatment with methotrexate and at least 6 months thereafter (see section 4.4). Prior to \n\ninitiating therapy, women of childbearing potential must be informed of the risk of malformations \nassociated with methotrexate and any existing pregnancy must be excluded with certainty by taking \n\nappropriate measures, e.g. a pregnancy test. During treatment pregnancy tests should be repeated as \n\nclinically required (e.g. after any gap of contraception). Female patients of reproductive potential \n\nmust be counselled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. \n \nContraception in males \n\nIt is not known if methotrexate is present in semen. Methotrexate has been shown to be genotoxic in \n\nanimal studies, such that the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be \nexcluded. Limited clinical evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or \n\nmiscarriage following paternal exposure to low-dose methotrexate (less than 30 mg/week). For \n\nhigher doses, there is insufficient data to estimate the risks of malformations or miscarriage \nfollowing paternal exposure. \n\nAs precautionary measures, sexually active male patients or their female partners are recommended \n\nto use reliable contraception during treatment of the male patient and for at least 6 months after \n\ncessation of methotrexate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 6 months following \ndiscontinuation of methotrexate. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \nMethotrexate is contraindicated during pregnancy in non-oncological indications (see section 4.3). \n\nIf pregnancy occurs during treatment with methotrexate and up to six months thereafter, medical \n\nadvice should be given regarding the risk of harmful effects on the child associated with treatment \n\nand ultrasonography examinations should be performed to confirm normal foetal development. \nIn animal studies, methotrexate has shown reproductive toxicity, especially during the first trimester \n\n(see section 5.3). Methotrexate has been shown to have a teratogenic effect in humans; it has been \n\nreported to cause foetal death and/or congenital abnormalities (e.g. craniofacial, cardiovascular, \ncentral nervous system and extremity-related).  \n\n \n\nMethotrexate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, \nintrauterine growth restriction and congenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 42.5% of pregnant women exposed to low-\ndose methotrexate treatment (less than 30 mg/week), compared to a reported rate of 22.5% \nin disease-matched patients treated with drugs other than methotrexate. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Major birth defects occurred in 6.6% of live births in women exposed to low-dose \nmethotrexate treatment (less than 30 mg/week) during pregnancy, compared to \n\napproximately 4% of live births in in disease-matched patients treated with drugs other than \n\nmethotrexate. \nInsufficient data is available for methotrexate exposure during pregnancy higher than 30 mg/week, \n\nbut higher rates of spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations are expected. \n\n \n\nWhen methotrexate was discontinued prior to conception, normal pregnancies have been reported.  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nBreast-feeding \nAs methotrexate is transferred into human milk and may cause toxicity in breast-feeding children, \ntreatment is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). If use of methotrexate during \n\nthe breast-feeding period should become necessary, breast-feeding is to be stopped prior to \n\ntreatment. \n \nFertility \nMethotrexate affects spermatogenesis and oogenesis and may decrease fertility. In humans, \n\nmethotrexate has been reported to cause oligospermia, menstrual dysfunction and amenorrhoea. \n\nThese effects appear to be reversible after discontinuation of therapy in most cases. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNordimet has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Central nervous system \n\n(CNS) symptoms, such as fatigue and confusion, can occur during treatment.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nMost serious adverse reactions of methotrexate include bone marrow suppression, pulmonary \ntoxicity, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, neurotoxicity, thromboembolic events, anaphylactic shock \n\nand Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nMost frequently (very common) observed adverse reactions of methotrexate include gastrointestinal \n\ndisorders (e.g. stomatitis, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite) and abnormal liver \n\nfunction tests (e.g. increased Alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), Aspartate aminotransferase \n(ASAT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase). Other frequently (common) occurring adverse reactions \n\nare leukopenia, anaemia, thrombopenia, headache, tiredness, drowsiness, pneumonia, interstitial \n\nalveolitis/pneumonitis often associated with eosinophilia, oral ulcers, diarrhoea, exanthema, \n\nerythema and pruritus. \n \nThe most relevant adverse reaction is suppression of the haematopoietic system and gastrointestinal \n\ndisorders. \n \nList of adverse reactions \nFrequencies are defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10) common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n\n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \nUncommon: Pharyngitis. \n\nRare: Infection (incl. reactivation of inactive chronic infection), sepsis, conjunctivitis. \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \n\nVery rare: lymphoma (see \u201cdescription\u201d below) \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon: Leukopenia, anaemia, thrombopenia. \n\nUncommon: Pancytopenia. \n\nVery rare: Agranulocytosis, severe courses of bone marrow depression, lymphoproliferative \ndisorders (see \u201cdescription below\u201d). \n\nNot known: Eosinophilia \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nRare: Allergic reactions, anaphylactic shock, hypogammaglobulinaemia. \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nUncommon: Precipitation of diabetes mellitus.  \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nUncommon: Depression, confusion. \n\nRare: Mood alterations. \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon: Headache, tiredness, drowsiness. \nUncommon: Dizziness. \n\nVery rare: Pain, muscular asthenia, paraesthesia/hypoaesthesia, changes in sense of taste (metallic \n\ntaste), convulsions, meningism, acute aseptic meningitis, paralysis. \n\nNot known: Encephalopathy/ Leukoencephalopathy. \n \n\nEye disorders  \n\nRare: Visual disturbances.  \nVery rare: Impaired vision, Retinopathy.  \n \n\nCardiac disorders  \nRare: Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade. \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\nRare: Hypotension, thromboembolic events  \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nCommon: Pneumonia, interstitial alveolitis/pneumonitis often associated with eosinophilia. \nSymptoms indicating potentially severe lung injury (interstitial pneumonitis) are: dry, not \n\nproductive cough, shortness of breath and fever. \n\nRare: Pulmonary fibrosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, shortness of breath and bronchial \nasthma, pleural effusion. \n\nNot known: Epistaxis, pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage. \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: Stomatitis, dyspepsia, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain. \n\nCommon: Oral ulcers, diarrhoea. \n\nUncommon: Gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding, enteritis, vomiting, pancreatitis. \nRare: Gingivitis. \n\nVery rare: Haematemesis, haematorrhea, toxic megacolon. \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders (see section 4.4) \nVery common: Abnormal liver function tests (increased ALAT, ASAT, alkaline phosphatase and \n\nbilirubin). \n\nUncommon: Cirrhosis, fibrosis and fatty degeneration of the liver, decrease in serum albumin. \nRare: Acute hepatitis. \n\nVery rare: Hepatic failure. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nCommon: Exanthema, erythema, pruritus. \n\nUncommon: Photosensitisation, loss of hair, increase in rheumatic nodules, skin ulcer, herpes \n\nzoster, vasculitis, herpetiform eruptions of the skin, urticaria. \nRare: Increased pigmentation, acne, petechiae, ecchymosis, allergic vasculitis. \n\nVery rare: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome), increased \n\npigmentary changes of the nails, acute paronychia, furunculosis, telangiectasia.  \nNot known: Skin exfoliation / dermatitis exfoliative  \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nUncommon: Arthralgia, myalgia, osteoporosis. \nRare: Stress fracture. \n\nNot known: Osteonecrosis of jaw (secondary to lymphoproliferative disorders) \n\n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nUncommon: Inflammation and ulceration of the urinary bladder, renal impairment, disturbed \n\nmicturition. \n\nRare: Renal failure, oliguria, anuria, electrolyte disturbances. \nNot known: Proteinuria. \n\n \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon: Inflammation and ulceration of the vagina. \n\nVery rare: Loss of libido, impotence, gynaecomastia, oligospermia, impaired menstruation, vaginal \n\ndischarge. \n\n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nRare: Fever, wound-healing impairment. \n\nNot known: Asthenia, injection site necrosis, oedema. \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nLymphoma/Lymphoproliferative disorders: there have been reports of individual cases of \nlymphoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders which subsided in a number of cases once \n\ntreatment with methotrexate had been discontinued.  \n\n \n\nThe appearance and degree of severity of undesirable effects depends on the dosage level and the \nfrequency of administration. However, as severe undesirable effects can occur even at lower doses, \n\nit is indispensable that patients are monitored regularly by the doctor at short intervals. \n\nOnly mild local skin reactions (such as burning sensations, erythema, swelling, discolouration, \npruritus, severe itching, pain) were observed with subcutaneous use, decreasing during therapy. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nSymptoms of overdose \n\nThe adverse toxic effects of methotrexate mainly affect the haematopoietic and gastrointestinal \n\nsystem. Symptoms include leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, \n\nbone marrow depression, mucositis, stomatitis, oral ulceration, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal \nulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding. Some patients showed no signs of overdose. There are \n\nreports of death due to sepsis, septic shock, renal failure and aplastic anaemia. \n\n \nTreatment of overdose \n\nCalcium folinate is the specific antidote for neutralising the adverse toxic effects of methotrexate. In \n\nthe event of accidental overdose, a dose of calcium folinate equal to or higher than the offending \ndose of methotrexate should be administered intravenously or intramuscularly within 1 hour, and \n\ndosing continued until serum level of methotrexate are below 10-7 mol/L. \n\n \n\nIn the event of a massive overdose, hydration and urinary alkalisation may be required to prevent \nprecipitation of methotrexate and/or its metabolites within the renal tubules. Neither haemodialysis \n\nnor peritoneal dialysis has been shown to improve methotrexate elimination. Effective methotrexate \n\nclearance has been reported with acute, intermittent haemodialysis using a high-flux dialyser. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or \n\npsoriasis vulgaris, administration of folic or folinic acid may reduce methotrexate toxicity \n(gastrointestinal symptoms, inflammation of oral mucosa, hair loss and increase of liver enzymes) \n\n(see section 4.5). Prior to using folic acid products, monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is \n\nrecommended, since folic acid may mask an existing vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in adults \nover 50 years of age. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, other \n\nimmunosuppressants. ATC code: L04AX03 \n\n \n\nMethotrexate is a folic acid antagonist which belongs to the class of cytotoxic agents known as \nantimetabolites. It acts by the competitive inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase and thus \n\ninhibits DNA synthesis. It has not yet been clarified, as to whether the efficacy of methotrexate, in \n\nthe management of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and chronic polyarthritis, is due to an \nanti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effect and to which extent a methotrexate-induced \n\nincrease in extracellular adenosine concentration at inflamed sites contributes to these effects.  \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral application, methotrexate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. When administered \nin low doses (7.5 mg/m2 to 80 mg/m2 BSA), methotrexate has a mean bioavailability of \n\napproximately 70%, although considerable inter- and intra-subject variations are possible \n\n(25-100%). Plasma peak concentrations are attained within 1-2 hours. Subcutaneous, intravenous \nand intramuscular administration demonstrated similar bioavailability. \n\n \n\nDistribution \nApproximately 50% of methotrexate is bound to serum proteins. Upon being distributed into body \n\ntissues, high concentrations particularly in liver, kidneys and spleen in form of polyglutamates can \n\nbe found, which can be retained for weeks or months. When administered in small doses, \n\nmethotrexate passes into the body fluids in minimal amounts; under high doses (300 mg/kg body \nweight), concentrations between 4 and 7 \u00b5g/ml have been measured in the body fluids. Average \n\nterminal half-life is 6-7 hours and demonstrates considerable variation (3-17 hours). Half-life may \n\nbe prolonged to 4 times the normal length in patients with third spaces (pleural effusion, ascites). \n \nBiotransformation \nApproximately 10% of the administered methotrexate is metabolised intrahepatically. The major \n\nmetabolite is 7-hydroxymethotrexate. \n \nElimination \nExcretion takes place, mainly in unchanged form, primarily renal via glomerular filtration and \n\nactive secretion in the proximal tubulus. Approx. 5-20% of methotrexate and 1-5% of 7-\n\nhydroxymethotrexate are eliminated via the bile. Pronounced enterohepatic blood flow exists. \n \nIn case of renal insufficiency, elimination is delayed significantly. Impaired elimination in presence \n\nof hepatic insufficiency is not known. \n \nMethotrexate passes the placental barrier in rats and monkeys. \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nChronic toxicity \nChronic toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs showed toxic effects in the form of gastrointestinal \n\nlesions, myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. \n \nMutagenic and carcinogenic potential \nLong-term studies in rats, mice and hamsters did not show any evidence of a tumorigenic potential \n\nof methotrexate. Methotrexate induces gene and chromosome mutations both in vitro and in vivo. A \n\nmutagenic effect is suspected in humans. \n \nReproductive toxicology \nTeratogenic effects have been identified in four species (rats, mice, rabbits, cats). In rhesus \n\nmonkeys, no malformations comparable to humans occurred. \n \n\n \n\n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nSodium chloride \nSodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) \n\nWater for injections \n\n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other \n\nmedicinal products. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore below 25\u00b0C. \nKeep the pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nPre-filled pen \n\nPre-filled pen with a 1 mL type I glass syringe with attached stainless steel needle and a chlorobutyl \n\nrubber plunger stopper.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If  you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Nordimet is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Nordimet \n3. How to use Nordimet \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Nordimet \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Nordimet is and what it is used for \n \nNordimet contains the active substance methotrexate which works by:  \n- reducing  inflammation or swelling, and  \n-         reducing the activity of the immune system (the body\u2019s own defense mechanism). An \n\noveractive immune system has been linked to inflammatory diseases. \n \n\nNordimet is a medicine used to treat a range of inflammatory diseases: \n- active rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Active rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition \n\nthat affects the joints; \n-  severe, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis in five or more joints (the condition is therefore \n\ncalled polyarthritic), in patients who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); \n\n- a severe form of treatment resistant psoriasis (also called severe recalcitrant disabling \n\npsoriasis), in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to other treatments \nincluding phototherapy (light therapy), PUVA (ultraviolet light therapy), and retinoids (group \n\nof medicines derived from vitamin A).  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n138 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Nordimet \n \nDo not use Nordimet if: \n\n- you are allergic to methotrexate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- you have severe kidney disease (your doctor will be able to tell you if you have severe kidney \n\ndisease) \n- you have severe liver disease (your doctor will be able to tell you if you have severe liver \n\ndisease) \n- you have disorders of the blood-forming system \n- your alcohol consumption is high \n- you have an impaired immune system \n- you have a severe or existing infection, e.g. tuberculosis or HIV \n- you have gastrointestinal ulcers \n- you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see section \u201cPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\u201d) \n- you receive vaccinations with live vaccines at the same time. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nAcute bleeding from the lungs in patients with underlying rheumatologic disease has been reported \n\nwith methotrexate. If you experience symptoms of spitting or coughing up blood you should contact \n\nyour doctor immediately. \n \n\nImportant warning about the dosing of Nordimet \nMethotrexate for the therapy of rheumatic diseases or diseases of the skin must only be used once \nweekly. Incorrect dosing of methotrexate may lead to serious adverse effects which may be fatal. \n\nPlease read section 3 of this package leaflet very carefully. \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Nordimet if: \n- you have diabetes mellitus and are being treated with insulin \n-  you have inactive, prolonged infections (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C, shingles [herpes \n\nzoster]) \n- you have/had any liver or kidney disease \n- you have problems with lung function \n- you are severely overweight \n- you have abnormal accumulation of liquid in the abdomen or in the cavity between the lungs \n\nand chest wall (ascites, pleural effusions) \n- you are dehydrated or suffer from conditions leading to dehydration (e.g. dehydration as a \n\nresult of vomiting, diarrhoea or inflammation of the mouth and lips) \n \nIf you have experienced problems with your skin after radiation therapy (radiation induced \ndermatitis) or sun-burn, these conditions can reappear when taking Nordimet. \n \nChildren, adolescents and elderly \nDose instructions depend on the patient\u2019s body weight. \n \n\nUse in children under 3 years of age is not recommended due to insufficient experience of using this \n\nmedicine in this age group. \n \nChildren, adolescents and the elderly being treated with Nordimet should be kept under close \n\nmedical surveillance to identify possible side effects as early as possible. \n \nThe dose for elderly patients should be lowered due to age-related reduced liver and kidney \nfunction. \n \nSpecial precautionary measures for treatment with Nordimet \nMethotrexate temporarily affects sperm and egg production, which is reversible in most cases. \n\nMethotrexate can cause miscarriage and severe birth defects. You must avoid becoming pregnant \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n\nwhen using methotrexate and for at least six months after treatment has stopped. See also section \n\n\u201cPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\u201d.  \nSkin changes caused by psoriasis can worsen during treatment with Nordimet if exposed to \n\nultraviolet irradiation. \n \nBefore the start of treatment and recommended follow-up examinations and precautions \nBefore treatment is started your doctor may carry out blood tests, and also check how well your \n\nkidneys and liver are working. You may also have a chest X-ray. Further tests may also be done \n\nduring and after treatment. Do not miss appointments for blood tests. \n \nIf the results of any of these tests are abnormal, treatment will only be resumed when all readings \n\nare back to normal. \n \nEven when Nordimet is used at low doses, serious side effects can occur. Your doctor will carry out \n\nblood and urine tests to make sure that any side effects are identified quickly. \n \nOther medicines and Nordimet \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal or natural medicinal \nproducts. \n \nIt is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking: \n- other treatments for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis such as leflunomide, sulphasalazine \n\n(a medicine that besides arthritis and psoriasis is also used to treat ulcerative colitis), aspirin, \n\nphenylbutazone, or amidopyrine \n-      alcohol (drinking alcohol should be avoided while you are taking Nordimet) \n-      azathioprine (used to prevent rejection after an organ transplant) \n-      retinoids (used to treat psoriasis and other skin disorders) \n-      anticonvulsant medicines (used to prevent fits), such as phenytoin, valproate or \n\ncarbamazepine \n-      cancer treatments \n-      barbiturates (sleeping injection) \n-      tranquillisers \n-      oral contraceptives \n-      probenecid (used to treat gout) \n-      antibiotics \n-      pyrimethamine (which is used to prevent and treat malaria) \n-      vitamin preparations containing folic acid \n-      proton-pump inhibitors (medicines that reduce the production of gastric acid and that are used \n\nto treat severe heartburn or ulcers), such as omeprazole \n-      theophylline (used to treat asthma) \n- any vaccination with a live vaccine (must be avoided), such as measles, mumps, influenza or \n\nyellow fever vaccines. \n \nNordimet with food, drink and alcohol \nDuring treatment with Nordimet, you must not drink any alcohol and should avoid excessive \n\nconsumption of coffee, soft drinks containing caffeine and black tea as this may enhance side \n\neffects or interfere with the efficacy of Nordimet. Also, make sure you drink plenty of liquids \nduring treatment with Nordimet because dehydration (reduction in body water) can increase the \n\ntoxicity of Nordimet. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nDo not use Nordimet during pregnancy or if you are trying to become pregnant. Methotrexate can \ncause birth defects, harm unborn babies or cause miscarriages. It is associated with malformations \n\nof the skull, face, heart and blood vessels, brain and limbs. Therefore, it is very important that \n\nmethotrexate is not given to pregnant patients or patients planning to become pregnant. In women \n\nof child-bearing age any possibility of pregnancy must be excluded with appropriate measures, e.g. \na pregnancy test before starting treatment. You must avoid becoming pregnant whilst taking \n\nmethotrexate and for at least 6 months after treatment is stopped by using reliable contraception \n\nthroughout this time (see also section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nIf you do become pregnant during treatment or suspect you might be pregnant, speak to your doctor \n\nas soon as possible. You should be offered advice regarding the risk of harmful effects on the child \n\nthrough treatment. \nIf you wish to become pregnant you should consult your doctor, who may refer you for specialist \n\nadvice before the planned start of treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during treatment because methotrexate passes into breast milk. If your doctor \n\nconsiders treatment with methotrexate absolutely necessary during the lactation period, you must \n\nstop breast-feeding. \n \nMale fertility \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the \n\nfather takes methotrexate less than 30 mg/week. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. \n\nMethotrexate may be genotoxic. This means that the medicine may cause genetic mutation. \nMethotrexate can affect sperm production with the potential to cause birth defects. Therefore, you \n\nshould avoid fathering a child or to donate semen whilst taking methotrexate and for at least 6 \n\nmonths after treatment is stopped.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nSide effects affecting the central nervous system, such as tiredness and dizziness, may occur during \n\ntreatment with Nordimet. In some cases, the ability to drive vehicles and/or use machines may be \n\nimpaired. If you feel tired or dizzy, you should not drive or use machines. \n \nNordimet contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and so is essentially \n\n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use Nordimet \n\n \n\nImportant warning about the dose of Nordimet \n\nUse Nordimet only once a week for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, active juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis requiring dosing once a week. Using too much of Nordimet \n\nmay be fatal. Please read section 3 of this leaflet very carefully. If you have any questions, please \n\ntalk to your doctor or pharmacist before you take this medicine. \n\n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\nNordimet is administered once a week only. You and your doctor can decide on a suitable day each \n\nweek to receive your injection. \n \nIncorrect administration of Nordimet can lead to severe side effects that may be fatal.  \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n\n \nDose in patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe recommended starting dose is 7.5 mg methotrexate once a week.  \n \nThe doctor may increase the dose if the used dose is not effective but tolerated well. The average \n\nweekly dose is 15-20 mg. Generally, a weekly dose of 25 mg should not be exceeded. Once \nNordimet starts working, the doctor may reduce the dose gradually to the lowest possible effective \n\nmaintenance dose. \n\n \nGenerally, improvement of symptoms can be expected after 4-8 weeks of treatment. Symptoms may \n\nreturn if treatment with Nordimet is stopped. \n \nDose in children and adolescents below 16 years with polyarthritic forms of juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis \nThe doctor will calculate the dose required from the child\u2019s body surface area (m2), and the dose is \n\nexpressed as mg/m2.  \n \nUse in children under < 3 years is not recommended due to insufficient experience in this age \ngroup. \n \nUse in adults with severe forms of psoriasis vulgaris or psoriatic arthritis \nYour doctor will give you a single test dose of 5-10 mg, in order to assess possible side effects.  \nIf the test dose is well tolerated, treatment will be continued after a week with a dose of \n\napproximately 7.5 mg.  \n\n \nResponse to treatment can generally be expected after 2-6 weeks. Depending on the effects of \n\ntreatment and results of blood and urine tests, the therapy is then continued or stopped. \n\n \n\nMethod and duration of administration \nNordimet is given as injection under the skin (subcutaneously). It must be injected once weekly and \n\nit is recommended to always inject Nordimet on the same day of the week.  \n \nAt the start of your treatment, Nordimet may be injected by medical staff. However, your doctor \nmay decide that you can learn how to inject Nordimet yourself. You will receive appropriate \n\ntraining for you to do this. Under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself, unless you \n\nhave been trained to do so. \n\n \nThe duration of treatment is determined by the treating physician. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, \n\njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis with Nordimet is a long-term \n\ntreatment. \n \n\nHow to give yourself an injection of Nordimet \nIf you have difficulty handling the pen, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Do not try to inject yourself \n\nif you have not been trained on how to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your doctor or \nnurse immediately. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n142 \n\nBefore injecting yourself with Nordimet \n-  Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. \n-  Check the pen is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear, yellow solution. If not, use \n\nanother pen. \n-  Check your last injection site to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin \n\ncolour, swelling, oozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. \n-  Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each \n\ntime. \n \nInstructions on injecting yourself with Nordimet \n1) Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n \n2) Sit or lie in a relaxed, comfortable position. Make sure you can see the skin area you are going to \n\ninject.  \n \n3) The pen is pre-filled and ready to use. Visually inspect the pen. You should see a yellow fluid \n\nthrough the viewing window. You may see a small air bubble, this does not affect the injection and \n\nwill not harm you. \n \nA droplet may appear at the tip of the needle. This is normal. \n \n4) Choose an injection site and clean it with the enclosed alcohol swab. It requires 30-60 seconds to \n\nbe effective. The skin on the front side abdominal wall and the skin at the front of the thigh are \nsuitable as injection sites. \n \n5) While holding the body of the pen, pull the cap off. Once you have taken the cap off, keep the \n\npen in your hand. Do not allow the pen to touch anything else. This is to make sure that the pen is \nnot accidentally activated and that the needle stays clean. \n \n\n \n \n \n6) Make a fold in the skin by gently pinching the skin of the injection place with your forefinger \nand thumb. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n \n7) Move the pen towards the skin fold (site of injection) with the needle shield pointing directly at \n\nthe site of injection. Place the yellow needle shield against the area of injection so that the entire rim \nof the needle shield is touching the skin. \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\n \n \n8) Apply downward pressure on the pen on to your skin until you hear and feel a \u201cclick\u201d. \nThis activates the pen and the solution will inject automatically into the skin. \n \n \n\n \n \n9) The injection lasts for a maximum of 10 seconds. You will feel and hear a second \u201cclick\u201d once \nthe injection is completed. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n10) Wait another 2-3 seconds before removing the pen from your skin. The safety shield on the pen \n\nis now locked to prevent any needlestick injuries. You can now let go of the skin fold. \n \n\n \n \n11) Visually inspect the pen through the viewing window. You should see green plastic. This means \n\nthat all the fluid has been injected. Discard the used pen into the sharps bin provided. Close the \ncontainer lid tightly and place the container out of reach of children. If you accidently get \n\nmethotrexate on the surface of the skin or soft tissues you must rinse with plenty of water. \n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n\n \nIf you use more Nordimet than you should \nFollow the dose recommendations of your treating doctor. Do not change the dose without your \ndoctor\u2019s recommendation. \n \nIf you suspect that you have used too much Nordimet, tell your doctor or contact the nearest \n\nhospital immediately. Take your medicine package and this leaflet with you if you go to a doctor or \nhospital. \n \nAn overdose of methotrexate can lead to severe toxic reactions. Overdose symptoms may include \n\neasy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stools, \ncoughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds, and decreased urinating. See also \n\nsection 4. \n \nIf you forget to use Nordimet \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, but continue taking the prescribed dose \n\nas normal. Ask your doctor for advice. \n \nIf you stop taking Nordimet \nYou should not interrupt or discontinue Nordimet treatment before discussing with your doctor. If \nyou suspect that you are experiencing side effects, contact your doctor immediately for advice. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get any sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, swelling of \nthe eyelids, face or lips, rash or itching (especially affecting your whole body). \n \n\nSerious side effects \nIf you develop any of the following side effects, contact your doctor immediately: \n- inflammation of the lungs (symptoms may be general illness, dry, irritating cough, shortness \n\nof breath, breathlessness at rest, chest pain, or fever)  \n- spitting or coughing blood \n- severe peeling or blistering of the skin \n- unusual bleeding (including vomiting blood) or bruising \n- severe diarrhoea \n- ulcers in mouth \n- black or tarry stools \n- blood in the urine or stools \n- tiny red spots on the skin \n- fever \n- yellowing of the skin (jaundice) \n- pain or difficulty in passing urine \n- thirst and/or frequent urination \n- fits (convulsions) \n- loss of consciousness \n- blurred or decreased vision \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\nThe following side effects have also been reported: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \nloss of appetite, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tummy pain, inflammation and ulcers in the mouth \n\nand throat, and increase in liver enzymes. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \nReduced blood cell formation with decrease in white and/or red blood cells and/or platelets \n\n(leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia), headache, tiredness, drowsiness, inflammation of the \n\nlungs (pneumonia) with dry, non-productive cough, shortness of breath and fever, diarrhoea, rash, \nreddening of the skin, itching. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \nDecrease in the number of blood cells and platelets , dizziness, confusion, depression, fits, \n\ninflammation of blood vessels, lung damage, ulcers and bleeding in the digestive tract, liver \ndisorders, diabetes, decreased blood protein, nettle rash, light sensitivity, brown skin, hair loss, \n\nincrease of rheumatic nodules, shingles, painful psoriasis, joint or muscle pain, osteoporosis \n\n(reduction of bone mass), inflammation and ulcers of the bladder (possibly with blood in the urine), \npainful urination, severe allergic reactions, inflammation and ulcers of the vagina, slow wound \n\nhealing. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \nInflammation of the sac around the heart, fluid in the sac around the heart, severe visual \n\ndisturbance, mood fluctuations, low blood pressure, blood clots, sore throat, interruption of \n\nbreathing, asthma, inflammation of the digestive tract, bloody stools, inflamed gums, abnormal \n\ndigestion, acute hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), changed colour of nails, acne, red or purple \nspots due to vessel bleeding, bone fracture, kidney failure, decrease or absence of urine, electrolyte \n\ndisturbances, defective sperm formation, menstruation disorders. \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \nInfections, severe failure of the bone marrow, liver failure, swollen glands, sleeplessness, pain, \n\nmuscle weakness, sensation of numbness or tingling / having less sensitivity to stimulation than \n\nnormal, changes in sense of taste (metallic taste), inflammation of the lining of the brain causing \nparalysis or vomiting, red eyes, damage to the retina of the eye, fluid in the lungs, vomiting blood, \n\ncold sores, protein in the urine, fever, loss of sex drive, problems having an erection, infection \n\naround a fingernail, severe complications of the gastrointestinal tract, boils, small blood vessels in \n\nthe skin, fungal infections, damage to the blood vessels of the skin, vaginal discharge, infertility, \nmale breast enlargement (gynaecomastia), inflammation of the brain, lymphoproliferative disorders \n\n(excessive growth of white blood cells). \n \nFrequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \nBleeding from the lungs, bone damage in the jaw (secondary to excessive growth of white blood \n\ncells), tissue destruction at injection site, redness and shedding of skin, swelling. \n\n \nOnly mild local skin reactions were observed with Nordimet and these decreased during therapy. \n \nNordimet may cause a reduction in the number of white blood cells and your resistance to infection \n\nmay be decreased. If you experience an infection with symptoms such as fever and serious \n\ndeterioration of your general condition, or fever with local infection symptoms such as sore \nthroat/sore pharynx/sore mouth or urinary problems you should see your doctor immediately. A \n\nblood test will be taken to check for possible reduction of white blood cells (agranulocytosis). It is \n\nimportant to tell your doctor that you are taking Nordimet. \n \nMethotrexate is known to cause bone disorders such as joint and muscle pain and osteoporosis. The \n\nfrequency of these risks in children is not known.  \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n\nNordimet may cause serious (sometimes life-threatening) side effects. Your doctor will do tests to \n\ncheck for abnormalities developing in the blood (e.g. low white blood cells, low platelets, \nlymphoma) and changes in the kidney and the liver. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.

What Nordimet is and what it is used for \n \nNordimet contains the active substance methotrexate which works by:  \n- reducing  inflammation or swelling, and  \n-         reducing the activity of the immune system (the body\u2019s own defense mechanism). An \n\noveractive immune system has been linked to inflammatory diseases. \n \n\nNordimet is a medicine used to treat a range of inflammatory diseases: \n- active rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Active rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition \n\nthat affects the joints; \n-  severe, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis in five or more joints (the condition is therefore \n\ncalled polyarthritic), in patients who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); \n\n- a severe form of treatment resistant psoriasis (also called severe recalcitrant disabling \n\npsoriasis), in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to other treatments \nincluding phototherapy (light therapy), PUVA (ultraviolet light therapy), and retinoids (group \n\nof medicines derived from vitamin A).  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n149 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Nordimet \n \nDo not use Nordimet if: \n\n- you are allergic to methotrexate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- you have severe kidney disease (your doctor will be able to tell you if you have severe kidney \n\ndisease) \n- you have severe liver disease (your doctor will be able to tell you if you have severe liver \n\ndisease) \n- you have disorders of the blood-forming system \n- your alcohol consumption is high \n- you have an impaired immune system \n- you have a severe or existing infection, e.g. tuberculosis or HIV \n- you have gastrointestinal ulcers \n- you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see section \u201cPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\u201d) \n- you receive vaccinations with live vaccines at the same time. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nAcute bleeding from the lungs in patients with underlying rheumatologic disease has been reported \n\nwith methotrexate. If you experience symptoms of spitting or coughing up blood you should contact \n\nyour doctor immediately. \n \n\nImportant warning about the dosing of Nordimet \nMethotrexate for the therapy of rheumatic diseases or diseases of the skin must only be used once \nweekly. Incorrect dosing of methotrexate may lead to serious adverse effects which may be fatal. \n\nPlease read section 3 of this package leaflet very carefully. \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Nordimet if: \n- you have diabetes mellitus and are being treated with insulin \n-  you have inactive, prolonged infections (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C, shingles [herpes \n\nzoster]) \n- you have/had any liver or kidney disease \n- you have problems with lung function \n- you are severely overweight \n- you have abnormal accumulation of liquid in the abdomen or in the cavity between the lungs \n\nand chest wall (ascites, pleural effusions) \n- you are dehydrated or suffer from conditions leading to dehydration (e.g. dehydration as a \n\nresult of vomiting, diarrhoea or inflammation of the mouth and lips) \n \nIf you have experienced problems with your skin after radiation therapy (radiation induced \ndermatitis) or sun-burn, these conditions can reappear when taking Nordimet. \n \nChildren, adolescents and elderly \nDose instructions depend on the patient\u2019s body weight. \n \n\nUse in children under 3 years of age is not recommended due to insufficient experience of using this \n\nmedicine in this age group. \n \nChildren, adolescents and the elderly being treated with Nordimet should be kept under close \n\nmedical surveillance to identify possible side effects as early as possible. \n \nThe dose for elderly patients should be lowered due to age-related reduced liver and kidney \nfunction. \n \nSpecial precautionary measures for treatment with Nordimet \nMethotrexate temporarily affects sperm and egg production, which is reversible in most cases. \n\nMethotrexate can cause miscarriage and severe birth defects. You must avoid becoming pregnant \n\n\n\n \n\n150 \n\nwhen using methotrexate and for at least six months after treatment has stopped. See also section \n\n\u201cPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\u201d.  \nSkin changes caused by psoriasis can worsen during treatment with Nordimet if exposed to \n\nultraviolet irradiation. \n \nBefore the start of treatment and recommended follow-up examinations and precautions \nBefore treatment is started your doctor may carry out blood tests, and also check how well your \n\nkidneys and liver are working. You may also have a chest X-ray. Further tests may also be done \n\nduring and after treatment. Do not miss appointments for blood tests. \n \nIf the results of any of these tests are abnormal, treatment will only be resumed when all readings \n\nare back to normal. \n \nEven when Nordimet is used at low doses, serious side effects can occur. Your doctor will carry out \n\nblood and urine tests to make sure that any side effects are identified quickly. \n \nOther medicines and Nordimet \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal or natural medicinal \nproducts. \n \nIt is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking: \n- other treatments for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis such as leflunomide, sulphasalazine \n\n(a medicine that besides arthritis and psoriasis is also used to treat ulcerative colitis), aspirin, \n\nphenylbutazone, or amidopyrine \n-      alcohol (drinking alcohol should be avoided while you are taking Nordimet) \n-      azathioprine (used to prevent rejection after an organ transplant) \n-      retinoids (used to treat psoriasis and other skin disorders) \n-      anticonvulsant medicines (used to prevent fits), such as phenytoin, valproate or \n\ncarbamazepine \n-      cancer treatments \n-      barbiturates (sleeping injection) \n-      tranquillisers \n-      oral contraceptives \n-      probenecid (used to treat gout) \n-      antibiotics \n-      pyrimethamine (which is used to prevent and treat malaria) \n-      vitamin preparations containing folic acid \n-      proton-pump inhibitors (medicines that reduce the production of gastric acid and that are used \n\nto treat severe heartburn or ulcers), such as omeprazole \n-      theophylline (used to treat asthma) \n- any vaccination with a live vaccine (must be avoided), such as measles, mumps, influenza or \n\nyellow fever vaccines. \n \nNordimet with food, drink and alcohol \nDuring treatment with Nordimet, you must not drink any alcohol and should avoid excessive \n\nconsumption of coffee, soft drinks containing caffeine and black tea as this may enhance side \n\neffects or interfere with the efficacy of Nordimet. Also, make sure you drink plenty of liquids \nduring treatment with Nordimet because dehydration (reduction in body water) can increase the \n\ntoxicity of Nordimet. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n151 \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nDo not use Nordimet during pregnancy or if you are trying to become pregnant. Methotrexate can \ncause birth defects, harm unborn babies or cause miscarriage. It is associated with malformations of \n\nthe skull, face, heart and blood vessels, brain and limbs. Therefore, it is very important that \n\nmethotrexate is not given to pregnant patients or patients planning to become pregnant. In women \n\nof child-bearing age any possibility of pregnancy must be excluded with appropriate measures, e.g. \na pregnancy test before starting treatment. You must avoid becoming pregnant whilst taking \n\nmethotrexate and for at least 6 months after treatment is stopped by using reliable contraception \n\nthroughout this time (see also section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nIf you do become pregnant during treatment or suspect you might be pregnant, speak to your doctor \n\nas soon as possible. You should be offered advice regarding the risk of harmful effects on the child \n\nthrough treatment. \nIf you wish to become pregnant you should consult your doctor, who may refer you for specialist \n\nadvice before the planned start of treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during treatment because methotrexate passes into breast milk. If your doctor \n\nconsiders treatment with methotrexate absolutely necessary during the lactation period, you must \n\nstop breast-feeding. \n \nMale fertility \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the \n\nfather takes methotrexate less than 30 mg/week. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. \n\nMethotrexate may be genotoxic. This means that the medicine may cause genetic mutation. \nMethotrexate can affect sperm production with the potential to cause birth defects. Therefore, you \n\nshould avoid fathering a child or to donate semen whilst taking methotrexate and for at least 6 \n\nmonths after treatment is stopped.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nSide effects affecting the central nervous system, such as tiredness and dizziness, may occur during \n\ntreatment with Nordimet. In some cases, the ability to drive vehicles and/or use machines may be \n\nimpaired. If you feel tired or dizzy, you should not drive or use machines. \n \nNordimet contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and so is essentially \n\n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use Nordimet \n \n\nImportant warning about the dose of Nordimet \n\nUse Nordimet only once a week for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, active juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis,psoriasis and psoriatitic arthritis requiring dosing once a week. Using too much of \n\nNordimet may be fatal. Please read section 3 of this leaflet very carefully. If you have any \n\nquestions, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you take this medicine. \n\n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n152 \n\nNordimet is administered once a week only. You and your doctor can decide on a suitable day each \n\nweek to receive your injection. \n \nIncorrect administration of Nordimet can lead to severe side effects that may be fatal.  \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n\n \nDose in patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe recommended starting dose is 7.5 mg methotrexate once a week.  \n \nThe doctor may increase the dose if the used dose is not effective but tolerated well. The average \n\nweekly dose is 15-20 mg. Generally, a weekly dose of 25 mg should not be exceeded. Once \nNordimet starts working, the doctor may reduce the dose gradually to the lowest possible effective \n\nmaintenance dose. \n\n \nGenerally, improvement of symptoms can be expected after 4-8 weeks of treatment. Symptoms may \n\nreturn if treatment with Nordimet is stopped. \n \nDose in children and adolescents below 16 years with polyarthritic forms of juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis \nThe doctor will calculate the dose required from the child\u2019s body surface area (m2), and the dose is \n\nexpressed as mg/m2.  \n \nUse in children under < 3 years is not recommended due to insufficient experience in this age \ngroup. \n \nUse in adults with severe forms of psoriasis vulgaris or psoriatic arthritis \nYour doctor will give you a single test dose of 5-10 mg, in order to assess possible side effects.  \nIf the test dose is well tolerated, treatment will be continued after a week with a dose of \n\napproximately 7.5 mg.  \n\n \nResponse to treatment can generally be expected after 2-6 weeks. Depending on the effects of \n\ntreatment and results of blood and urine tests, the therapy is then continued or stopped. \n\n \n\nMethod and duration of administration \nNordimet is given as injection under the skin (subcutaneously). It must be injected once weekly and \n\nit is recommended to always inject Nordimet on the same day of the week.  \n \nAt the start of your treatment, Nordimet may be injected by medical staff. However, your doctor \nmay decide that you can learn how to inject Nordimet yourself. You will receive appropriate \n\ntraining for you to do this. Under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself, unless you \n\nhave been trained to do so. \n\n \nThe duration of treatment is determined by the treating physician. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, \n\njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis with Nordimet is a long-term \n\ntreatment. \n \n\nHow to give yourself an injection of Nordimet \nIf you have difficulty handling the syringe, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Do not try to inject \n\nyourself if you have not been trained on how to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your \ndoctor or nurse immediately. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n153 \n\nBefore injecting yourself with Nordimet \n-  Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. \n-  Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear, yellow solution. If not, use \n\nanother syringe. \n-  Check your last injection site to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin \n\ncolour, swelling, oozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. \n-  Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each \n\ntime. \n \nInstructions on injecting yourself with Nordimet \n1) Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n \n2) Sit or lie in a relaxed, comfortable position. Make sure you can see the skin area you are going to \n\ninject.  \n \n3) The syringe is pre-filled and ready to use. Open the blister pack by peeling back the top layer all \n\nthe way off the blister pack as shown. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n4) Precaution: DO NOT lift the product by the plunger or needle cover. Remove the syringe from \n\nthe box by the body as shown in the picture below.  \n \n\n \n \n5) Visually inspect the syringe. You should see a yellow fluid through the viewing window. You \n\nmay see a small air bubble, this does not affect the injection and will not harm you. \n \n6) Choose an injection site and clean it with the enclosed alcohol swab. It requires 30-60 seconds to \nbe effective. The skin on the front side abdominal wall and the skin at the front of the thigh are \n\nsuitable as injection sites. \n \n7) While holding the body of the syringe, pull the cap off.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n154 \n\n \n \nDo not press on the plunger before injecting yourself to get rid of air bubbles. This can lead to a \n\nloss of the medicine. Once you have taken the cap off, keep the syringe in your hand. Do not allow \n\nthe syringe to touch anything else. This is to make sure that the needle stays clean. \n \n8) Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, make a fold \n\nin the skin by gently pinching the skin of the injection place with your forefinger and thumb. Make \n\nsure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n \n9) Move the syringe towards the skin fold (site of injection) with the needle shield pointing directly \n\nat the site of injection. Insert the full length of the needle into the skin fold. \n\n \n\n10) Press down on the plunger with your finger until the syringe is empty. This will send the \nmedication under the skin.  \n \n\n \n \n11) Remove the needle by pulling it out straight. The safety shield on the syringe will automatically \n\ncover the needle to prevent any needlestick injuries. You can now let go of the skin fold. \n \n\n \n \nNote: the safety system allowing release of the safety shield, can only be activated when the syringe \n\nhas been emptied by pressing the plunger all the way down.  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n155 \n\n12) Discard the used syringe into the sharps bin provided. Close the container lid tightly and place \n\nthe container out of reach of children. If you accidently get methotrexate on the surface of the skin \nor soft tissues you must rinse with plenty of water. \n \nIf you use more Nordimet than you should \nFollow the dose recommendations of your treating doctor. Do not change the dose without your \ndoctor\u2019s recommendation. \n \nIf you suspect that you have used too much Nordimet, tell your doctor or contact the nearest \n\nhospital immediately. Take your medicine package and this leaflet with you if you go to a doctor or \nhospital. \n \nAn overdose of methotrexate can lead to severe toxic reactions. Overdose symptoms may include \n\neasy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stools, \n\ncoughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds, and decreased urinating. See also \nsection 4. \n \nIf you forget to use Nordimet \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, but continue taking the prescribed dose \nas normal. Ask your doctor for advice. \n \nIf you stop taking Nordimet \nYou should not interrupt or discontinue Nordimet treatment before discussing with your doctor. If \nyou suspect that you are experiencing side effects, contact your doctor immediately for advice. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor straight away if you get any sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, swelling of \n\nthe eyelids, face or lips, rash or itching (especially affecting your whole body). \n \n\nSerious side effects \nIf you develop any of the following side effects, contact your doctor immediately: \n- inflammation of the lungs (symptoms may be general illness, dry, irritating cough, shortness \n\nof breath, breathlessness at rest, chest pain, or fever)  \n- spitting or coughing blood \n- severe peeling or blistering of the skin \n- unusual bleeding (including vomiting blood) or bruising \n- severe diarrhoea \n- ulcers in mouth \n- black or tarry stools \n- blood in the urine or stools \n- tiny red spots on the skin \n- fever \n- yellowing of the skin (jaundice) \n- pain or difficulty in passing urine \n- thirst and/or frequent urination \n- fits (convulsions) \n- loss of consciousness \n- blurred or decreased vision \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n156 \n\nThe following side effects have also been reported: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \nloss of appetite, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tummy pain, inflammation and ulcers in the mouth \n\nand throat, and increase in liver enzymes. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \nReduced blood cell formation with decrease in white and/or red blood cells and/or platelets \n\n(leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia), headache, tiredness, drowsiness, inflammation of the \n\nlungs (pneumonia) with dry, non-productive cough, shortness of breath and fever, diarrhoea, rash, \nreddening of the skin, itching. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \nDecrease in the number of blood cells and platelets , dizziness, confusion, depression, fits, \n\ninflammation of blood vessels, lung damage, ulcers and bleeding in the digestive tract, liver \ndisorders, diabetes, decreased blood protein, nettle rash, light sensitivity, brown skin, hair loss, \n\nincrease of rheumatic nodules, shingles, painful psoriasis, joint or muscle pain, osteoporosis \n\n(reduction of bone mass), inflammation and ulcers of the bladder (possibly with blood in the urine), \npainful urination, severe allergic reactions, inflammation and ulcers of the vagina, slow wound \n\nhealing. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \nInflammation of the sac around the heart, fluid in the sac around the heart, severe visual \n\ndisturbance, mood fluctuations, low blood pressure, blood clots, sore throat, interruption of \n\nbreathing, asthma, inflammation of the digestive tract, bloody stools, inflamed gums, abnormal \n\ndigestion, acute hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), changed colour of nails, acne, red or purple \nspots due to vessel bleeding, bone fracture, kidney failure, decrease or absence of urine, electrolyte \n\ndisturbances, defective sperm formation, menstruation disorders. \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \nInfections, severe failure of the bone marrow, liver failure, swollen glands, sleeplessness, pain, \n\nmuscle weakness, sensation of numbness or tingling / having less sensitivity to stimulation than \nnormal, changes in sense of taste (metallic taste), inflammation of the lining of the brain causing \n\nparalysis or vomiting, red eyes, damage to the retina of the eye, fluid in the lungs, vomiting blood, \n\ncold sores, protein in the urine, fever, loss of sex drive, problems having an erection, infection \n\naround a fingernail, severe complications of the gastrointestinal tract, boils, small blood vessels in \nthe skin, fungal infections, damage to the blood vessels of the skin, vaginal discharge, infertility, \n\nmale breast enlargement (gynaecomastia), inflammation of the brain, lymphoproliferative disorders \n\n(excessive growth of white blood cells). \n \nFrequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\nBleeding from the lungs, bone damage in the jaw (secondary to excessive growth of white blood \n\ncells), tissue destruction at injection site, redness and shedding of skin, swelling. \n \nOnly mild local skin reactions were observed with Nordimet and these decreased during therapy. \n \nNordimet may cause a reduction in the number of white blood cells and your resistance to infection \n\nmay be decreased. If you experience an infection with symptoms such as fever and serious \ndeterioration of your general condition, or fever with local infection symptoms such as sore \n\nthroat/sore pharynx/sore mouth or urinary problems you should see your doctor immediately. A \n\nblood test will be taken to check for possible reduction of white blood cells (agranulocytosis). It is \n\nimportant to tell your doctor that you are taking Nordimet. \n \nMethotrexate is known to cause bone disorders such as joint and muscle pain and osteoporosis. The \n\nfrequency of these risks in children is not known.  \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n157 \n\nNordimet may cause serious (sometimes life-threatening) side effects. Your doctor will do tests to \n\ncheck for abnormalities developing in the blood (e.g. low white blood cells, low platelets, \nlymphoma) and changes in the kidney and the liver. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \n\nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.       How to store Nordimet \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.  \n\n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label of the pre-filled syringe \nand the carton after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore below 25\u00b0C. \nKeep the syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice that the solution is not clear and contains particles. \n \nNordimet is for single use only. Any used syringe should be discarded. \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

The PRAC concluded that an update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the \n\nadverse reaction \u201cskin exfoliation / dermatitis exfoliative\u201d with a frequency \u201cnot known\u201d was \n\nwarranted for all methotrexate containing products. The PL should be amended accordingly. \n\nIn view of available data on paraesthesia / hypoaesthesia (not restricted to extremities) from \n\nspontaneous reports, including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and a positive re-\n\nchallenge, and existing product information the PRAC considers a causal relationship between \n\nmethotrexate and paraesthesia / hypoaesthesia (not restricted to extremities) is at least a reasonable \n\npossibility. The PRAC concluded that an update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add or amend the \n\nadverse reaction \u201cparaesthesia / hypoaesthesia\u201d not restricted to the extremities with a frequency of \n\n\u201cvery rare\u201d was warranted for low dose methotrexate-containing products. The PL should be \n\namended accordingly. \n\nIn view of available data on oedema from spontaneous reports, including in some cases a close \n\ntemporal relationship, and a positive de-challenge the PRAC considers a causal relationship \n\nbetween methotrexate and oedema is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that an \n\nupdate of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction \u201coedema\u201d with a frequency \u201cnot \n\nknown\u201d was warranted for low dose methotrexate-containing products. The PL should be amended \n\naccordingly. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for methotrexate the CHMP is of the opinion that the \n\nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing methotrexate is unchanged subject to the \n\nproposed changes to the product information. \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) - you have severe kidney disease (your doctor will be able to tell you if you have severe kidney disease) - you have severe liver disease (your doctor will be able to tell you if you have severe liver disease) - you have disorders of the blood-forming system - your alcohol consumption is high - you have an impaired immune system - you have a severe or existing infection, e.g. tuberculosis or hiv - you have gastrointestinal ulcers - you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see section \"pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\") - you receive vaccinations with live vaccines at the same time. warnings and precautions acute bleeding from the lungs in patients with underlying rheumatologic disease has been reported with methotrexate. if you experience symptoms of spitting or coughing up blood you should contact your doctor immediately. important warning about the dosing of nordimet methotrexate for the therapy of rheumatic diseases or diseases of the skin must only be used once weekly. incorrect dosing of methotrexate may lead to serious adverse effects which may be fatal. please read section 3 of this package leaflet very carefully. talk to your doctor before using nordimet if: - you have diabetes mellitus and are being treated with insulin - you have inactive, prolonged infections (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis b or c, shingles [herpes zoster]) - you have/had any liver or kidney disease - you have problems with lung function - you are severely overweight - you have abnormal accumulation of liquid in the abdomen or in the cavity between the lungs and chest wall (ascites, pleural effusions) - you are dehydrated or suffer from conditions leading to dehydration (e.g. dehydration as a result of vomiting, diarrhoea or inflammation of the mouth and lips) if you have experienced problems with your skin after radiation therapy (radiation induced dermatitis) or sun-burn, these conditions can reappear when taking nordimet. children, adolescents and elderly dose instructions depend on the patient's body weight. use in children under 3 years of age is not recommended due to insufficient experience of using this medicine in this age group. children, adolescents and the elderly being treated with nordimet should be kept under close medical surveillance to identify possible side effects as early as possible. the dose for elderly patients should be lowered due to age-related reduced liver and kidney function. special precautionary measures for treatment with nordimet methotrexate temporarily affects sperm and egg production, which is reversible in most cases. methotrexate can cause miscarriage and severe birth defects. you must avoid becoming pregnant 139 when using methotrexate and for at least six months after treatment has stopped. see also section \"pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\". skin changes caused by psoriasis can worsen during treatment with nordimet if exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. before the start of treatment and recommended follow-up examinations and precautions before treatment is started your doctor may carry out blood tests, and also check how well your kidneys and liver are working. you may also have a chest x-ray. further tests may also be done during and after treatment. do not miss appointments for blood tests. if the results of any of these tests are abnormal, treatment will only be resumed when all readings are back to normal. even when nordimet is used at low doses, serious side effects can occur. your doctor will carry out blood and urine tests to make sure that any side effects are identified quickly. other medicines and nordimet tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal or natural medicinal products. it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking: - other treatments for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis such as leflunomide, sulphasalazine (a medicine that besides arthritis and psoriasis is also used to treat ulcerative colitis), aspirin, phenylbutazone, or amidopyrine - alcohol (drinking alcohol should be avoided while you are taking nordimet) - azathioprine (used to prevent rejection after an organ transplant) - retinoids (used to treat psoriasis and other skin disorders) - anticonvulsant medicines (used to prevent fits), such as phenytoin, valproate or carbamazepine - cancer treatments - barbiturates (sleeping injection) - tranquillisers - oral contraceptives - probenecid (used to treat gout) - antibiotics - pyrimethamine (which is used to prevent and treat malaria) - vitamin preparations containing folic acid - proton-pump inhibitors (medicines that reduce the production of gastric acid and that are used to treat severe heartburn or ulcers), such as omeprazole - theophylline (used to treat asthma) - any vaccination with a live vaccine (must be avoided), such as measles, mumps, influenza or yellow fever vaccines. nordimet with food, drink and alcohol during treatment with nordimet, you must not drink any alcohol and should avoid excessive consumption of coffee, soft drinks containing caffeine and black tea as this may enhance side effects or interfere with the efficacy of nordimet. also, make sure you drink plenty of liquids during treatment with nordimet because dehydration (reduction in body water) can increase the toxicity of nordimet. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. pregnancy do not use nordimet during pregnancy or if you are trying to become pregnant. methotrexate can cause birth defects, harm unborn babies or cause miscarriages. it is associated with malformations of the skull, face, heart and blood vessels, brain and limbs. therefore, it is very important that methotrexate is not given to pregnant patients or patients planning to become pregnant. in women of child-bearing age any possibility of pregnancy must be excluded with appropriate measures, e.g. a pregnancy test before starting treatment. you must avoid becoming pregnant whilst taking methotrexate and for at least 6 months after treatment is stopped by using reliable contraception throughout this time (see also section \"warnings and precautions\"). if you do become pregnant during treatment or suspect you might be pregnant, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. you should be offered advice regarding the risk of harmful effects on the child through treatment. if you wish to become pregnant you should consult your doctor, who may refer you for specialist advice before the planned start of treatment. breast-feeding do not breast-feed during treatment because methotrexate passes into breast milk. if your doctor considers treatment with methotrexate absolutely necessary during the lactation period, you must stop breast-feeding. male fertility the available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the father takes methotrexate less than 30 mg/week. however, a risk cannot be completely excluded. methotrexate may be genotoxic. this means that the medicine may cause genetic mutation. methotrexate can affect sperm production with the potential to cause birth defects. therefore, you should avoid fathering a child or to donate semen whilst taking methotrexate and for at least 6 months after treatment is stopped. driving and using machines side effects affecting the central nervous system, such as tiredness and dizziness, may occur during treatment with nordimet. in some cases, the ability to drive vehicles and/or use machines may be impaired. if you feel tired or dizzy, you should not drive or use machines. nordimet contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and so is essentially \"sodium-free\".", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nordimet", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "allergic",

about the dose of nordimet use nordimet only once a week for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis requiring dosing once a week. using too much of nordimet may be fatal. please read section 3 of this leaflet very carefully. if you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you take this medicine. always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. nordimet is administered once a week only. you and your doctor can decide on a suitable day each week to receive your injection. incorrect administration of nordimet can lead to severe side effects that may be fatal. the recommended dose is: dose in patients with rheumatoid arthritis the recommended starting dose is 7.5 mg methotrexate once a week. the doctor may increase the dose if the used dose is not effective but tolerated well. the average weekly dose is 15-20 mg. generally, a weekly dose of 25 mg should not be exceeded. once nordimet starts working, the doctor may reduce the dose gradually to the lowest possible effective maintenance dose. generally, improvement of symptoms can be expected after 4-8 weeks of treatment. symptoms may return if treatment with nordimet is stopped. dose in children and adolescents below 16 years with polyarthritic forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis the doctor will calculate the dose required from the child's body surface area (m2), and the dose is expressed as mg/m2. use in children under < 3 years is not recommended due to insufficient experience in this age group. use in adults with severe forms of psoriasis vulgaris or psoriatic arthritis your doctor will give you a single test dose of 5-10 mg, in order to assess possible side effects. if the test dose is well tolerated, treatment will be continued after a week with a dose of approximately 7.5 mg. response to treatment can generally be expected after 2-6 weeks. depending on the effects of treatment and results of blood and urine tests, the therapy is then continued or stopped. method and duration of administration nordimet is given as injection under the skin (subcutaneously). it must be injected once weekly and it is recommended to always inject nordimet on the same day of the week. at the start of your treatment, nordimet may be injected by medical staff. however, your doctor may decide that you can learn how to inject nordimet yourself. you will receive appropriate training for you to do this. under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself, unless you have been trained to do so. the duration of treatment is determined by the treating physician. treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis with nordimet is a long-term treatment. how to give yourself an injection of nordimet if you have difficulty handling the pen, ask your doctor or pharmacist. do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained on how to do so. if you are not sure what to do, talk to your doctor or nurse immediately. before injecting yourself with nordimet - check the expiry date on the medicine. do not use if the date has passed. - check the pen is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear, yellow solution. if not, use another pen. - check your last injection site to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin colour, swelling, oozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. - decide where you are going to inject the medicine. change the place where you inject each time. instructions on injecting yourself with nordimet 1) wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 2) sit or lie in a relaxed, comfortable position. make sure you can see the skin area you are going to inject. 3) the pen is pre-filled and ready to use. visually inspect the pen. you should see a yellow fluid through the viewing window. you may see a small air bubble, this does not affect the injection and will not harm you. a droplet may appear at the tip of the needle. this is normal. 4) choose an injection site and clean it with the enclosed alcohol swab. it requires 30-60 seconds to be effective. the skin on the front side abdominal wall and the skin at the front of the thigh are suitable as injection sites. 5) while holding the body of the pen, pull the cap off. once you have taken the cap off, keep the pen in your hand. do not allow the pen to touch anything else. this is to make sure that the pen is not accidentally activated and that the needle stays clean. 6) make a fold in the skin by gently pinching the skin of the injection place with your forefinger and thumb. make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. 7) move the pen towards the skin fold (site of injection) with the needle shield pointing directly at the site of injection. place the yellow needle shield against the area of injection so that the entire rim of the needle shield is touching the skin. 8) apply downward pressure on the pen on to your skin until you hear and feel a \"click\". this activates the pen and the solution will inject automatically into the skin. 9) the injection lasts for a maximum of 10 seconds. you will feel and hear a second \"click\" once the injection is completed. 10) wait another 2-3 seconds before removing the pen from your skin. the safety shield on the pen is now locked to prevent any needlestick injuries. you can now let go of the skin fold. 11) visually inspect the pen through the viewing window. you should see green plastic. this means that all the fluid has been injected. discard the used pen into the sharps bin provided. close the container lid tightly and place the container out of reach of children. if you accidently get methotrexate on the surface of the skin or soft tissues you must rinse with plenty of water. if you use more nordimet than you should follow the dose recommendations of your treating doctor. do not change the dose without your doctor's recommendation. if you suspect that you have used too much nordimet, tell your doctor or contact the nearest hospital immediately. take your medicine package and this leaflet with you if you go to a doctor or hospital. an overdose of methotrexate can lead to severe toxic reactions. overdose symptoms may include easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stools, coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds, and decreased urinating. see also section 4. if you forget to use nordimet do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, but continue taking the prescribed dose as normal. ask your doctor for advice. if you stop taking nordimet you should not interrupt or discontinue nordimet treatment before discussing with your doctor. if you suspect that you are experiencing side effects, contact your doctor immediately for advice. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nordimet", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",

(cannot be estimated from the available data): bleeding from the lungs, bone damage in the jaw (secondary to excessive growth of white blood cells), tissue destruction at injection site, redness and shedding of skin, swelling. only mild local skin reactions were observed with nordimet and these decreased during therapy. nordimet may cause a reduction in the number of white blood cells and your resistance to infection may be decreased. if you experience an infection with symptoms such as fever and serious deterioration of your general condition, or fever with local infection symptoms such as sore throat/sore pharynx/sore mouth or urinary problems you should see your doctor immediately. a blood test will be taken to check for possible reduction of white blood cells (agranulocytosis). it is important to tell your doctor that you are taking nordimet. methotrexate is known to cause bone disorders such as joint and muscle pain and osteoporosis. the frequency of these risks in children is not known. nordimet may cause serious (sometimes life-threatening) side effects. your doctor will do tests to check for abnormalities developing in the blood (e.g. low white blood cells, low platelets, lymphoma) and changes in the kidney and the liver. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety
