PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules for oral suspension. \nWhite to off-white granules. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nTranslarna is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a nonsense \nmutation in the dystrophin gene, in ambulatory patients aged 2 years and older (see section 5.1). \n \nThe presence of a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene should be determined by genetic testing \n(see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Translarna should only be initiated by specialist physicians with experience in the \nmanagement of Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy. \n \nPosology \n \nAtaluren should be administered orally every day in 3 doses. \n \nThe first dose should be taken in the morning, the second at midday, and the third in the evening. \nRecommended dosing intervals are 6 hours between morning and midday doses, 6 hours between \nmidday and evening doses, and 12 hours between the evening dose and the first dose on the next day.  \n \nThe recommended dose is 10 mg/kg body weight in the morning, 10 mg/kg body weight at midday, \nand 20 mg/kg body weight in the evening (for a total daily dose of 40 mg/kg body weight). \n\nT \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nTranslarna is available in sachets of 125 mg, 250 mg or 1000 mg. The table below provides \ninformation on which sachet strength(s) to use in the preparation of the recommended dose by body \nweight range.  \n \n\nWeight \nRange \n(kg) \n\nNumber of sachets \nMorning  Midday Evening \n\n125 mg \nsachets \n\n250 mg \nsachets \n\n1000 \nmg \n\nsachets \n\n125 mg \nsachets \n\n250 mg \nsachets \n\n1000 \nmg \n\nsachets \n\n125 mg \nsachets \n\n250 mg \nsachets \n\n1000 \nmg \n\nsachets \n12 14 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 \n15 16 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 \n17 20 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 \n21 23 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 \n24 26 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 \n27 31 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 2 0 \n32 35 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2 0 \n36 39 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 3 0 \n40 44 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 3 0 \n45 46 0 2 0 0 2 0 1 3 0 \n47 55 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 \n56 62 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 1 \n63 69 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 \n70 78 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 2 1 \n79 86 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 3 1 \n87 93 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 3 1 \n94 105 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 \n\n106 111 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 2 \n112 118 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2 \n119 125 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 2 2 \n \nDelayed or missed dose \nIf there is a delay in the administration of ataluren of less than 3 hours after the morning or midday \ndoses or less than 6 hours after the evening dose, the dose should be taken with no changes to the \nsubsequent dose schedules. If there is a delay of more than 3 hours after the morning or midday doses \nor more than 6 hours after the evening dose, the dose should not be taken, and patients should resume \ntheir usual dosing schedule. Patients should not take a double or extra dose if a dose is missed. It is \nimportant to administer the correct dose. Increasing the dose above the recommended dose may be \nassociated with reduced effectiveness. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of ataluren in patients aged 65 and older have not yet been established (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Treatment of \npatients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease is not \nrecommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nPaediatric patients with body weight \u226512 kg are treated as per the dosing recommendations by body \nweight range (see above dosing table). The recommended dose is the same for all age ranges, i.e. \n10 mg/kg body weight in the morning, 10 mg/kg body weight at midday, and 20 mg/kg body weight in \nthe evening (for a total daily dose of 40 mg/kg body weight).  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Translarna in children <12kg and aged 6 months to 2 years have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTranslarna should be administered orally after mixing it to a suspension in liquid or in semi-solid food. \nSachets should only be opened at the time of dose preparation. The full contents of each sachet should \nbe mixed with, at least 30 ml of liquid (water, milk, fruit juice) or 3 tablespoons of semi-solid food \n(yoghurt or apple sauce). The prepared dose should be mixed well before administration. The amount \nof the liquid or semi-solid food can be increased based on patient preference. Patients should take the \nentire dose. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nConcomitant use of intravenous aminoglycosides (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients who do not have a nonsense mutation \n \nPatients must have a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene as part of their underlying disease state, \nas determined by genetic testing. Patients who do not have a nonsense mutation should not receive \nataluren. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAn increase in ataluren exposure and in ataluren metabolite has been reported in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min). The toxicity of the metabolite is unknown. Higher ataluren \nexposure was associated with potential decrease in efficacy. Therefore, patients with severe renal \nimpairment or end-stage renal disease should be treated with ataluren only if the anticipated clinical \nbenefit outweighs the potential risk, and should be closely monitored for possible metabolite toxicity \nand decrease in efficacy. A lower ataluren dose should be considered. \n \nTreatment should not be initiated in previously untreated patients with eGFR <30 ml/min (see sections \n4.2 and 5.2). \n \nChanges in lipid profile \n \nBecause changes in lipid profile (increased triglycerides and cholesterol) were reported for some \npatients in clinical trials, it is recommended that total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides be \nmonitored on an annual basis in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD) \npatients receiving ataluren, or more frequently as needed based on the patient\u2019s clinical status. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nHypertension with use of concomitant systemic corticosteroids \n \nBecause hypertension with use of concomitant systemic corticosteroids was reported for some \npatients in clinical trials, it is recommended that resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure be \nmonitored every 6 months in nmDMD patients receiving ataluren concomitantly with \ncorticosteroids, or more frequently as needed based on the patient\u2019s clinical status.  \n \nRenal function monitoring \n \nBecause small increases in mean serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and cystatin C were \nobserved in the controlled studies of nmDMD, it is recommended that serum creatinine, BUN, and \ncystatin C be monitored every 6 to 12 months in nmDMD patients receiving ataluren, or more \nfrequently as needed based on the patient\u2019s clinical status. \n \nPotential interactions with other medicinal products \n \nCaution should be exercised when ataluren is co-administered with medicinal products that are \ninducers of UGT1A9, or substrates of OAT1 or OAT3 (see section 4.5). \n \nAminoglycosides \n \nAminoglycosides have been shown to reduce the readthrough activity of ataluren in vitro. In addition, \nataluren was found to increase nephrotoxicity of intravenous aminoglycosides. The co-administration \nof these medicinal products with ataluren should be avoided (see section 4.3). Since the mechanism by \nwhich ataluren increases nephrotoxicity of intravenous aminoglycosides is not known, concomitant \nuse of other nephrotoxic medicinal products with ataluren is not recommended. If this is unavoidable \n(e.g. vancomycin to treat MRSA) careful monitoring of renal function is advised (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAminoglycosides \n \nAtaluren should not be co-administered with intravenous aminoglycosides, based on cases of \ndecreased renal function observed in a clinical trial in patients with nmCF (see section 4.3).  \n \nElevations of serum creatinine occurred in several nmCF patients treated with ataluren and \nintravenous aminoglycosides together with other antibiotics for cystic fibrosis exacerbations. The \nserum creatinine elevations resolved in all cases, with discontinuation of the intravenous \naminoglycoside, and either continuation or interruption of Translarna. These findings suggested that \nco-administration of Translarna and intravenous aminoglycosides may potentiate the nephrotoxic \neffect of the aminoglycosides. Therefore, if treatment with intravenous aminoglycosides is necessary \nthe treatment with Translarna should be stopped and can be resumed 2 days after administration of the \naminoglycoside has ended. The effect of co-administration of ataluren with other nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products is unknown. \n \nDehydration may be a contributing factor in some of these cases. Patients should maintain adequate \nhydration while taking ataluren (see section 4.4). \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on ataluren pharmacokinetics \nBased on in vitro studies, ataluren is a substrate of UGT1A9. Co-administration of rifampicin, a strong \ninducer of metabolic enzymes including UGT1A9, decreased ataluren exposure by 29%. The \nsignificance of these findings for humans is unknown. Caution should be exercised when ataluren is \nco-administered with medicinal products that are inducers of UGT1A9 (e.g. rifampicin). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nEffect of ataluren on pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \nBased on in vitro studies, ataluren has the potential to inhibit UGT1A9, organic anion transporter 1 \n(OAT1), organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 \n(OATP1B3). Co-administration of ataluren with mycophenolate mofetil in healthy subjects did not \naffect the exposure of its active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (a substrate of UGT1A9). No dose \nadjustment is required when ataluren is co-administered with medicinal products that are substrates of \nUGT1A9.  \n \nIn a clinical study to evaluate the potential for ataluren to inhibit the OATP1B3 transport system using \na single-dose of 80 mg telmisartan, an in-vitro selective OATP1B3 substrate, ataluren increased the \nexposure to telmisartan by 28%. This effect is considered clinically not relevant. However, the \nmagnitude of this effect could be larger for the 40 mg dose of telmisartan. Therefore, caution should \nbe exercised when ataluren is co-administered with medicinal products that are substrates of OAT1 or \nOATP1B3 because of the risk of increased concentration of these medicinal products (e.g. oseltamivir, \naciclovir, captopril, furosemide, bumetanide, valsartan, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, \npitavastatin).  \n \nCaution should also be exercised when ataluren is co-administered with OAT3 substrates (e.g. \nciprofloxacin), especially those OAT3 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. In a clinical \nstudy, the extent of exposure for ciprofloxacin was 32% higher in the presence of ataluren. In a \nseparate clinical study, the extent of exposure for adefovir was 60% higher in the presence of ataluren. \nCaution should be exercised when ataluren is co-administered with adefovir.  \n \nBased on the in vitro studies, ataluren is not expected to be an inhibitor of neither p-gp mediated \ntransport nor of cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism. Similarly, ataluren is not expected in vivo to \nbe an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.  \n \nCoadministration of corticosteroids (deflazacort, prednisone, or prednisolone) with ataluren did not \naffect the plasma concentrations of ataluren. No clinically relevant change in the plasma \nconcentrations of corticosteroids was seen with co-administration of ataluren. These data indicate no \napparent drug-drug interaction between corticosteroids and ataluren, and no dose adjustments are \nrequired. \n \nMedicinal products that affect the p-glycoprotein transporter \n \nIn vitro, ataluren is not a substrate for the p-glycoprotein transporter. The pharmacokinetics of ataluren \nare unlikely to be affected by medicinal products that inhibit the p-glycoprotein transporter. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of ataluren in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity only at doses that resulted in maternal toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nAs a precautionary measure, it is recommended to avoid the use of ataluren during pregnancy. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ataluren/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ataluren/metabolites in milk \n(see section 5.3). A risk to the breastfed new-borns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ataluren. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFertility \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no hazard for humans based on a standard male and female fertility study in \nrats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe effect of ataluren on driving, on cycling, or on using machines has not been tested. Patients who \nexperience dizziness should use caution when driving, cycling or using machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile of ataluren is based on pooled data from two randomised, double-blind, 48-week \nplacebo-controlled studies conducted in a total of 232 male patients with Duchenne muscular \ndystrophy (nmDMD) caused by a nonsense mutation treated at the recommended dose of \n40 mg/kg/day (10, 10, 20 mg/kg; n=172) or at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (20, 20, 40 mg/kg; n=60), as \ncompared to placebo-treated patients (n=172). \n \nThe most common adverse reactions in the 2 placebo-controlled studies were vomiting, diarrhoea, \nnausea, headache, upper abdominal pain, and flatulence, all occurring in \u22655% of all ataluren-treated \npatients. In both studies, 1/232 (0.43%) patients treated with ataluren discontinued due to an adverse \nreaction of constipation and 1/172 (0.58%) placebo patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse \nreaction of disease progression (loss of ambulation).  \n \nAn open-label study was performed including patients aged 2-5 years (n=14) to evaluate the PK and \nsafety of ataluren. A higher frequency of malaise (7.1%), pyrexia (42.9%), ear infection (28.6%), and \nrash (21.4%) were reported in patients aged 2-5 years compared with patients 5 years of age and older. \nHowever, these conditions are reported more frequently in the younger children in general. Safety data \nfrom 28 weeks of therapy showed a similar safety profile of ataluren in patients 2-5 years as compared \nwith patients aged 5 years and older. \n \nAdverse reactions were generally mild or moderate in severity, and no treatment-related serious \nadverse events were reported among ataluren-treated patients in these 2 studies. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe adverse reactions reported in patients with nmDMD treated with the recommended daily dose of \n40 mg/kg/day ataluren in the 2 placebo-controlled studies are presented in Table 1. Adverse reactions \nreported in >1 patient in the 40 mg/kg/day group at a frequency greater than that of the placebo group \nare presented by MedDRA System Organ Class, Preferred Term, and frequency. Frequency groupings \nare defined to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10) and common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10).  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1.

Long term safety data is not available. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions (laboratory abnormalities) \n \nSerum lipids \nAn increase in serum lipids, i.e. cholesterol and triglycerides, was observed. There have been cases \nreported where this increase to abnormal high values was already observed after 4 weeks. \n \nRenal function tests \nDuring the randomised, placebo-controlled studies, small increases in mean serum creatinine, BUN, \nand cystatin C were observed. The values tended to stabilize early in the study and did not increase \nfurther with continued treatment. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nHealthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg of ataluren experienced transient, \nlow-grade symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. No serious adverse reactions were \nobserved in these subjects. In the event of a suspected overdose, supportive medical care should be \nprovided including consulting with a healthcare professional and close observation of the clinical \nstatus of the patient. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for disorders of the musculo-skeletal system, ATC code: \nM09AX03 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nA nonsense mutation in DNA results in a premature stop codon within an mRNA. This premature stop \ncodon in the mRNA causes disease by terminating translation before a full-length protein is generated. \nAtaluren enables ribosomal readthrough of mRNA containing such a premature stop codon, resulting \nin production of a full-length protein. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nNonclinical in vitro experiments in nonsense mutation cellular assays and fish larvae cultured in an \nataluren solution have shown that ataluren enabled ribosomal readthrough with a bell-shaped \n(inverted-U shaped) concentration-response relationship. It is hypothesised that the in vivo dose \nresponse relationship may also be bell-shaped, but in vivo data were too limited to confirm this \nhypothesis in a mouse model for nmDMD and in humans. \n \nNonclinical in vitro studies suggest that continuous exposure to ataluren may be important for \nmaximizing activity and that effects of the active substance on ribosomal read-through of premature \nstop codons reverse shortly after withdrawal of ataluren. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Translarna were assessed in 2 randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, trials in nmDMD. The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was change in 6 \nMinute Walk Distance (6MWD) at Week 48. Other endpoints included in both trials were time to \npersistent 10% worsening in 6MWD, change in time to run/walk 10 meters at Week 48, change in \ntime to climb 4 stairs at Week 48, and change in time to descend 4 stairs at Week 48. Patients were \nrequired to have documented confirmation of the presence of a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin \ngene as determined by gene sequencing.  \n   \nStudy 1 evaluated 174 male patients, aged 5 to 20 years. All patients were required to be able to walk \n\u226575 meters without the need for assistive devices during a screening 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). \nThe majority of patients in all treatment groups were Caucasian (90%). Patients were randomised in a \n1:1:1 ratio and received ataluren or placebo 3 times per day (morning, midday, and evening), with 57 \nreceiving ataluren 40 mg/kg/day (10, 10, 20 mg/kg), 60 receiving ataluren 80 mg/kg/day (20, 20, \n40 mg/kg), and 57 receiving placebo.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nIn Study 1, a post hoc analysis of the primary endpoint showed that from baseline to Week 48, patients \nreceiving ataluren 40 mg/kg/day had a 12.9 meters mean decline in 6MWD, and patients receiving \nplacebo had a 44.1-meter mean decline in 6MWD (Figure 1). Thus, the mean change in observed \n6MWD from baseline to Week 48 was 31.3 meters better in the ataluren 40 mg/kg/day arm than in the \nplacebo arm (p=0.056). In a statistical based model the estimated mean difference was 31.7 meters \n(adjusted p=0.0367). There was no difference between ataluren 80 mg/kg/day and placebo. \n \nThese results indicate that ataluren 40 mg/kg/day slows the loss of walking ability in nmDMD \npatients. \n \nFigure 1.

There was no difference between ataluren 80 mg/kg/day and placebo.

All patients were required to be able to walk \n\u2265150 meters and less than 80% predicted without the need for assistive devices during a screening \n6MWT. The majority of patients in both treatment groups were Caucasian (76%). Patients were \nrandomised in a 1:1 ratio and received ataluren 40 mg/kg/day (n=115) or placebo (n=115) 3 times per \nday (morning, midday, and evening). \n \nAtaluren-treated patients experienced clinical benefit as measured by numerically favorable \ndifferences versus placebo across the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. As the primary \nendpoint (change in 6MWD from baseline to Week 48) did not reach statistical significance (p\u22640.05), \nall other p-values should be considered nominal. \n \nIn the ITT population, the difference between the ataluren and placebo arms in mean change in \nobserved 6MWD from baseline to Week 48 was 15.4 meters better in the ataluren 40 mg/kg/day arm \nthan in the placebo arm. In a statistical based model the estimated mean difference was 13.0 meters \n(p=0.213), Figure 4.

In the ITT population, the hazard ratio for ataluren versus placebo was 0.75 (p=0.160), \nrepresenting a 25% reduction in the risk of 10% 6MWD worsening.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety, pharmacokinetics and exploratory effectiveness of Translarna were assessed in an open-\nlabel study in children between 2 and 5 years of age with nmDMD. The efficacy of Translarna in \nchildren aged 2 - 5 years has been established on extrapolation from patients aged >5years. \n \nIn the clinical program investigating the efficacy and safety of monotherapy ataluren in patients with \nnonsense mutation cystic fibrosis, no statistically significant effect was observed in the primary and \nkey secondary clinical outcome measures (ppFEV1 and pulmonary exacerbation rate) in adults and \nchildren aged 6 years and older. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nataluren in two subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 28 days and infants from \n28 days to less than 6 months in nmDMD, as per Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) decision in the \ngranted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nataluren in one subset of the paediatric population aged 6 months to less than 2 years old in nmDMD, \nas per Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) decision in the granted indication (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.European Medicines Agency will \nreview new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as \nnecessary. \n \n\n- 10m Run/Walk 4-Stair Climb 4-Stair Descend ti) 0 \n\"'C \nC \n0 \n(,) \n(1) \nti) \n\nu.i 2 (/) \n+I \nC \n\n-1.8 s ns -1 .2 s (1) \nC) E -1.8 s \nC -\nC (1) 4 \n(1) C \n\nl!?

Based on the urinary recovery of \nradioactivity in a single-dose study of radiolabelled ataluren, the oral bioavailability of ataluren is \nestimated to be \u2265 55%. Ataluren plasma concentrations at steady state increase proportionally with \nincreasing dose. Steady-state plasma concentrations are dose-proportional for ataluren doses between \n10 and 50 mg/kg, and no accumulation is observed after repeated dosing.  \n \nDistribution \nIn vitro, ataluren is 99.6% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent of plasma \nconcentration. Ataluren does not distribute into red blood cells. \n \nBiotransformation \nAtaluren is metabolized by conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) \nenzymes, predominantly UGT1A9 in liver, intestine and kidney.  \n \nIn vivo, the only metabolite detected in plasma after oral administration of radio-labelled ataluren was \nthe ataluren-O-1\u03b2-acyl glucuronide; exposure to this metabolite in humans was approximately 8% of \nthe plasma AUC of ataluren. \n \nElimination \nAtaluren plasma half-life ranges from 2-6 hours and is unaffected either by dose or repeated \nadministration. The elimination of ataluren is likely dependent on hepatic and renal glucuronidation of \nataluren followed by renal and hepatic excretion of the resulting glucuronide metabolite. \n \nAfter a single oral dose of radiolabelled ataluren, approximately half of the administered radioactive \ndose is recovered in the faeces and the remainder was recovered in the urine. In the urine, unchanged \nataluren and the acyl glucuronide metabolite account for <1% and 49%, respectively, of the \nadministered dose. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are dose-proportional for ataluren doses between 10 and 50 mg/kg, \nand no accumulation is observed after repeated dosing. Based on data in healthy volunteers, the \nrelative bioavailability of ataluren is approximately 40% lower at steady-state than after the initial \ndose. The onset of reduction in relative bioavailability is estimated to occur approximately 60 hours \nafter the first dose. The steady-state is established after approximately two weeks of thrice daily \ndosing. \n \nCharacteristic in specific groups of subjects or patients \n \nAge \nBased on data from subjects ranging in age from 2 years to 57 years, there is no apparent effect of age \non ataluren plasma exposure. Age-adjusted dosing is not required. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ataluren has been evaluated in study PTC124-GD-030 over a duration of 4 \nweeks. Ataluren plasma concentrations in patients from 2 to less than 5 years old were consistent with \nthose seen in patients above the age of 5 years receiving the 10/10/20 mg/kg dose regimen. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nGender \nFemales were not studied in nmDMD clinical trials. However there were no apparent effects of gender \non ataluren plasma exposure in other populations. \n \nRace \nIt is unlikely that the pharmacokinetics of ataluren are significantly affected by UGT1A9 \npolymorphisms in a Caucasian population. Due to the low number of other races included in the \nclinical studies, no conclusions can be drawn on the effect of UGT1A9 in other ethnic groups. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nIn a pharmacokinetic study in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, following a single \ndose administration, ataluren plasma exposure changed by -13%, 27%, and 61% for the mild, \nmoderate and severe groups, respectively, and 46% for the end-stage renal disease group compared \nwith the normal renal function group. In addition, a 3 to 8 fold increase in ataluren metabolite has been \nreported in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min). Following multiple dosing, the \nincrease in ataluren and ataluren metabolite is anticipated to be higher in patients with severe renal \nimpairment and end-stage renal disease when compared with patients with normal renal function at \nsteady state. Patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease \nshould be treated with ataluren only if the anticipated clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nBased on a pharmacokinetic assessment conducted in groups with either mild, moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment versus a control group of healthy subjects, no dose adjustment is required for \npatients with any degree of hepatic impairment. No apparent differences of the total ataluren exposure \nin the control, mild, and severe hepatic impairment groups were observed. An approximately 40% \ndecrease of mean total ataluren exposure in the moderate hepatic impairment group versus the control \ngroup was noted probably due to the small sample size and variability. \n \nNon-ambulatory \nThere were no apparent differences in either steady-state relative bioavailability or apparent clearance \ndue to loss of ambulation. No dosing adjustment is needed for patients who are becoming non-\nambulatory. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and genotoxicity.  \n \nA standard package of reproduction toxicity studies was available. No effects on male and female \nfertility were observed, but effects of early juvenile treatment on fertility during adulthood were not \ninvestigated. In rats and rabbits embryo-foetal toxicity (e.g. increased early resorptions, post-\nimplantation loss, decreased viable foetuses) and signs of delayed development (increased skeletal \nvariations) were found in the presence of maternal toxicity. Exposure at the no observed adverse effect \nlevel (NOAEL) was similar to (rabbit) or 4 times (rat) the systemic exposure in humans (40 \nmg/kg/day). Placental transfer was shown of radiolabelled ataluren in rats. At a single tested, relatively \nlow, maternal dose of 30 mg/kg, the concentration of foetal radioactivity was \u2264 27% of the maternal \nconcentration. In the rat pre/postnatal developmental toxicity study, at exposure about 5 times human \nexposure, significant maternal toxicity as well as effects on offspring body weight and development of \nambulatory activity were observed. The maternal systemic exposure at the no observed effect level \n(NOEL) for neonatal toxicity was about 3 times human exposure. At a single, relatively low, maternal \ndose of 30 mg/kg radiolabelled ataluren, the highest measured concentration of radioactivity in rat \nmilk was 37% of the maternal plasma concentration. Presence of radioactivity in pup plasma \nconfirmed absorption from the milk by the pups. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nRenal toxicity (nephrosis in the distal nephron) occurred in repeat oral dose studies in mice at systemic \nexposure equivalent to 0.3 times the steady state AUC in patients administered Translarna at \nrespective morning, midday, and evening doses of 10-, 10-, 20-mg/kg and higher. \n \nIn a 26-week transgenic mouse model for carcinogenicity, no evidence of carcinogenicity was found. \nIn a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, one case of hibernoma was found. In addition, at exposure much \nhigher than in patients an increase of (rare) urinary bladder tumours was found. Significance of the \nurinary bladder tumours for humans is considered unlikely. \n \nOne out of two 26-week rat repeat dose studies, initiated in 4-5 weeks old rats, showed a dose related \nincrease of the incidence of malignant hibernoma, a rare tumour in rats. In addition, one case of \nmalignant hibernoma was found at the highest dose in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. Background \nincidence of this tumour type in rats as well as humans is very low and the mechanism causing these \ntumours in the rat studies (including its relation to ataluren treatment) is unknown. The significance \nfor humans is not known. \n \nA 1-year study in 10-12 weeks old dogs demonstrated findings in the adrenal gland (focal \ninflammation and degeneration in the glucocorticoid-producing regions of the cortex) and a mild \ncompromise of cortisol production after exogenous stimulation with adrenocorticotropic hormone. \nThese findings were seen in dogs at systemic exposure equivalent to 0.8 times the steady state AUC in \npatients administered Translarna at respective morning, midday, and evening doses of 40 mg/kg/day \nand higher. In a rat distribution study a high adrenal concentration of ataluren was observed. \n \nIn addition to the above mentioned effects, several other less adverse effects were found in the repeat \ndose studies; in particular decreased body weight gain, food intake and increased liver weight without \na histological correlate and of unclear clinical significance. Also rat and dog studies showed changes \nin plasma lipid (cholesterol and triglycerides) suggestive of changes in fat metabolism. \n \nNo adverse findings, including in the adrenal gland, were observed in a 3-month study in neonatal \ndogs (1-week old) followed by a 3-month recovery period up to steady state systemic exposures \nequivalent to the steady state AUC in patients. In preliminary studies in neonatal dogs (1-week old), \ninitial systemic exposures equivalent to 5-10 times the steady state AUC in patients were not tolerated \nin some animals. \n \n \n6.

What Translarna is and what it is used for \n \nTranslarna is a medicine that contains the active substance ataluren. \n \nTranslarna is used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a specific genetic defect that \naffects normal muscle function. \n \nTranslarna is used to treat patients aged 2 years and older, who are able to walk. \n \nYou or your child will have been tested by your doctor before starting treatment with Translarna, in \norder to confirm that your disease is suitable for treatment with this medicine. \n \nHow does Translarna work? \n \nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by genetic changes that result in an abnormality in a muscle \nprotein called dystrophin which is needed for muscles to work properly. Translarna enables the \nproduction of working dystrophin and helps muscles work properly. \n \n \n2.
