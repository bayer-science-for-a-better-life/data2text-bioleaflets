NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nCeplene 0.5 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\n \n\nOne vial of 0.5 mL of solution contains 0.5 mg of histamine dihydrochloride. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\nClear, colourless aqueous solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nCeplene maintenance therapy is indicated for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in \n\nfirst remission concomitantly treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2). The efficacy of Ceplene has not been \n\nfully demonstrated in patients older than age 60. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nCeplene maintenance therapy should be administered following completion of consolidation therapy \n\nin patients concomitantly treated with IL-2 under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\nmanagement of acute myeloid leukaemia. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nFor dosing instructions for Ceplene in combination with IL-2, see posology below.    \n\n \n\nInterleukin-2 (IL-2) \n\n \n\nIL-2 is administered twice daily as a subcutaneous injection 1 to 3 minutes prior to the \n\nadministration of Ceplene; each dose of IL-2 is 16,400 IU/kg (1 µg/kg). \n\n \n\nInterleukin-2 (IL-2) is commercially available as a recombinant IL-2; aldesleukin. The dispensing and \n\nstorage directions in the section 6.6 are specific to aldesleukin. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nCeplene \n\n \n\n0.5 mL solution is sufficient for a single dose (see section 6.6). \n\nCeplene is administered 1 to 3 minutes after each injection of IL-2.  Each 0.5 mL Ceplene dose is \n\ninjected slowly, over 5-15 minutes.  \n\n \n\nTreatment cycles \n\n \n\nCeplene and IL-2 are administered for 10 treatment cycles: each cycle consists of a treatment period of \n\n21 days (3 weeks) followed by a three-week or six-week treatment-free period. \n\nFor cycles 1-3, each cycle consists of 3 weeks of treatment, followed by a 3-week treatment free \n\nperiod. For cycles 4-10, each cycle consists of 3 weeks of treatment, followed by a 6-week treatment \n\nfree period.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosing regimen is presented in Tables 1 and 2. \n\n \n\nTable 1: For treatment cycles 1-3 with Ceplene and IL-2 \n\n \n\nWeek number (w)* Treatment* \n\nCycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 \n\nw.1 to w.3 \n\n(Days 1-21) \nw.7 to w.9 \n\n(Days 1-21) \nw.13 to w.15 \n\n(Days 1-21) \n\nIL-2 16 400 IU/kg followed by 0.5 mL Ceplene. \n\nTwice daily.  \n\nw.4 to w.6 w.10 to w.12 w.16 to w.18 Treatment-free (3 weeks) \n\n*see dose modification for provisions for the modification to dose and dosage schedule \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2:  For treatment cycles 4-10 with Ceplene and IL-2, same as for Table 1 above, with the \n\nexception of number of cycles and duration of rest periods \n\n \n\nWeek number (w)* Treatment* \n\nCycles \n\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \n\nw.19 \n\nto \n\nw.21 \n\nw.28 \n\nto \n\nw.30 \n\nw.37 \n\nto \n\nw.39 \n\nw.46 \n\nto \n\nw.48 \n\nw.55- \n\nto \n\nw.57 \n\nw.64 \n\nto \n\nw.66 \n\nw.73 \n\nto \n\nw.75 \n\nIL-2 16 400 IU/kg followed by 0.5 mL \n\nCeplene.

Doses of Ceplene and IL-2 should be modified as necessary based on \n\nindividual patient tolerance to treatment.  It is recommended that dose modifications be addressed \n\nearly in treatment.  The dose reductions can be temporary or permanent.  \n\nShould Ceplene related toxicities occur (such as hypotension, headache), the injection time can be \n\nincreased from 5 minutes to a maximum duration of 15 minutes. \n\n \n\nFor patients experiencing grade 1 toxicity events \n\nNo altered dose recommendations with the exception of grade 1 neurologic toxicity and grade 1 \n\ngeneralised toxic dermatitis. For the dose recommendations for these grade 1 toxicity events refer to \n\nthe relevant sections below: \n\n \n\nFor patients experiencing grade 1-4 neurologic toxicity  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n-for grade 1 to 3 toxicity, treatment should be discontinued until grade 0 toxicity event has \n\n been achieved.  Treatment should then be resumed at a 20% dose reduction for both Ceplene \n\n and IL-2. \n\n-for grade 4 toxicity, discontinuation of treatment should be considered.  \n\n \n\nFor patients experiencing grade 1-4 generalised toxic dermatitis  \n\n-for grade 1 toxicity, the treatment should be delayed for 48 hours or until all symptoms have \n\n been resolved.  Treatment should then be resumed using the full dose of Ceplene, but  \n\n reducing the IL-2 dose by 20%.   \n\n-for grade 2 toxicity, the IL-2 dose should be reduced 50% and only increased to full dose if  \n\n the symptoms do not reappear.  Ceplene and IL-2 doses should be separated by 60 minutes,  \n\n which should be maintained throughout treatment.   \n\n-for grade 3 and 4 toxicity, treatment should be discontinued and not resumed until events  \n\n have been resolved.  Treatment should only be resumed after consideration of risk – benefit \n\n to the patient. \n\n \n\nFor patients experiencing grade 2 (including cardiac function, renal, hepatic) toxicity \n\n- treatment should be discontinued until the event has returned to grade 1 \n\n- the time of injection of the dose of Ceplene should be extended to a maximum of 15 minutes. \n\n- for cardiac, hepatic or renal toxicities the dose should be reduced by 20% for both Ceplene \n\n  and IL-2. \n\n \n\nFor patients experiencing grade 3 and 4 (including hypotension, arrhythmia) toxicities \n\n- treatment should be discontinued until the event is resolved.  A maximum delay of one \n\n  treatment cycle can be considered for the resolution of grade 3 and 4 events. \n\n \n\nFor persistent hypotension, headache, arrhythmia, cardiac, hepatic and renal toxicities \n\n- the time of injection of the dose of Ceplene should be extended to a maximum of  \n\n15 minutes. \n\n- the dose amount of both Ceplene and IL-2 should be reduced by 20%. \n\n \n\nFever \n\n- IL-2 can be discontinued for 24 hours and then restarted at a 20% dose reduction level. \n\n \n\nAbnormal WBC counts \n\n- the dose of IL-2 can be reduced by 20% for the remaining duration of the treatment course \n\n and if abnormal WBC counts re-occur during the following cycle a permanent IL-2 reduction  \n\n is recommended. \n\n \n\nLocalised toxic dermatitis \n\n- treatment should be discontinued until symptoms resolved. Treatment can be resumed by \n\n  administering Ceplene at the full dose and IL-2 at 50%. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients  \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of Ceplene has not been fully demonstrated in patients older than age 60. \n\n \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment may be more sensitive to the blood pressure lowering effects of \n\nCeplene. Although the degree of renal impairment has no demonstrable effect on the pharmacokinetic \n\ndisposition of Ceplene, caution is warranted when Ceplene is administered to patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment. However, no Ceplene dose reduction is normally required in renally impaired \n\npatients. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nCeplene should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2). Plasma Ceplene levels are higher in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment, \n\nand these patient groups tend to experience more tachycardia and lower blood pressure after Ceplene \n\ndosing than do patients with normal or mildly affected liver function. Plasma drug levels were not \n\npredictive of adverse effects, however, and effects did not correlate closely with drug exposure. Dose \n\nreduction of Ceplene is normally not required in hepatically impaired patients, but caution should be \n\nused in these patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Ceplene in children below 18 years of age have not yet been established. \n\nNo data are available.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nCeplene is for subcutaneous use only.  \n\n \n\nOne to 3 minutes after the subcutaneous administration of IL-2 has been completed, Ceplene should be \n\nadministered by slow subcutaneous injection at a rate not to exceed 0.1 mL (0.1 mg histamine \n\ndihydrochloride) per minute.  The usual time for administering a 0.5 mL Ceplene dose is 5 minutes.  \n\nTo reduce potential adverse reactions, the administration time may be lengthened to a maximum of \n\n15 minutes, see below. Ceplene can be administered via an ambulatory infusion syringe pump or by \n\ncontrolled manual subcutaneous injection by syringe with a timer. \n\n \n\nThe first dose of Ceplene and IL-2 on day 1 of the initiation of the first cycle of treatment should be \n\nadministered in the clinic under direct supervision by a physician.  Patient monitoring on day 1 should \n\ninclude vital signs, including pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate.  If the patient experiences a \n\nsignificant change in vital signs, the physician should evaluate the status of the patient and continue to \n\nmonitor vital signs; these patients should be monitored during subsequent treatments. \n\n \n\nSubsequent injections of Ceplene may be self-administered at home by a patient who demonstrates a \n\ngood understanding of necessary precautions and who has demonstrated adequate injection skills.  \n\nInjections should be preferably administered in a supervised setting in the presence of an adult family \n\nmember, friend, or other care provider who is capable of responding appropriately should signs or \n\nsymptoms of hypotension occur.  \n\n \n\nThe preferred injection areas are the thighs and the abdomen. Ceplene should not be injected into the \n\nsame anatomic region as IL-2.  \n\n \n\nThe twice daily dosing of IL-2 and Ceplene should be separated by a minimum of 6 hours. Patients \n\nshould remain at rest for 20 minutes after injection of Ceplene. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of Interleukin-2 (aldesleukin) before administration, see \n\ncommercially available IL-2 SmPC. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n Patients with significantly compromised cardiac function, e.g., NYHA Class III/IV. \n\n Patients receiving systemic steroid therapy, clonidine and H2 blocking agents. \n\n Patients who have received an allogenic stem cell transplant. \n\n During pregnancy. \n\n During breast feeding. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n\n \n\nCeplene should be administered 1 to 3 minutes after IL-2 administration, and not concomitantly. \n\nRapid subcutaneous injection or injection into a vascular space may result in severe hypotension, \n\ntachycardia, or syncope.   \n \n\nTreatment with Ceplene in conjunction with IL-2 should be used with caution in patients with poorly \n\ncompensated cardiac function.  Patients with cardiac disease should be evaluated for ventricular \n\nejection fraction and wall function by echocardiography or nuclear medicine stress test and then \n\ntreated with caution. \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored during treatment for possible clinical complications due to hypotension \n\nor hypovolaemia.  Ceplene should be administered in the clinic under supervision of the physician on \n\nday 1 of the initial treatment cycle.  Patient monitoring on day 1 should include vital signs, including \n\npulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate. \n\n \n\nPatient monitoring during subsequent treatment days or cycles should be performed as long as the \n\npatient continues to experience significant changes in vital signs during administration of Ceplene.  If \n\nsignificant hypotension or related symptoms are observed in subsequent treatment cycles, dose \n\nreduction should be initiated and if required, administered in hospital until responses to treatment \n\nallow for home administration. \n\n \n\nCaution should be used for patients with any of the following: symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, \n\npast or present peptic or oesophageal ulcer disease with a history of bleeding, clinically significant \n\nrenal disease and stroke within the last 12 months.  Where appropriate, consideration should be made \n\nto providing concomitant treatment with a proton pump inhibitor. \n\n \n\nPatients with clinically significant infection requiring the use of antibiotics, antifungals, or antivirals, \n\nor who have completed prior anti-infectious therapy within 14 days of starting treatment should be \n\ntreated with caution unless the use of antibiotics and antivirals were for prophylaxis purposes. \n\n \n\nPatients with a prior history of autoimmune disease (including systemic lupus, inflammatory bowel \n\ndisease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis) should be treated with caution. \n\nMonitoring of laboratory test results is recommended including standard haematological and blood \n\nchemistry tests. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving the following medicinal products should be treated with caution (see section 4.5): \n\n- Beta-blockers or other anti-hypertensive agents.  \n\n- H1 blocking agents and neuroleptics (anti-psychotics) with H1 receptor blocking properties.  \n\n- Tricyclic anti-depressants that may have H1 and H2 receptor blocking properties.  \n\n- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and anti-malarial and anti-trypanosomal agents.  \n\n- Neuromuscular blocking agents, narcotic analgesics, and various contrast media.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nWhile posology differs, when Ceplene is used in conjunction with IL-2, physicians should also refer to \n\nthe Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for IL-2 and observe the respective medicinal \n\nproduct interactions. \n\n \n\nH2 receptor antagonists with imidazole structures similar to histamine, e.g., cimetidine, systemic \n\nsteroids and clonidine, must not be used during treatment with Ceplene (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers and other anti-hypertensive agents should be used with caution during treatment with \n\nCeplene.  Concurrent administration of medicinal products with cardiotoxicity or blood pressure \n\nlowering effects may increase the toxicity of Ceplene. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nH1 receptor blocking antihistamines or neuroleptics (anti-psychotics) with H1 receptor blocking \n\nproperties that might decrease efficacy of Ceplene should be avoided. \n \n\nTricyclic anti-depressants may have H1 and H2 receptor blocking properties and should be avoided.  \n\n \n\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors, anti-malarial, and anti-trypanosomal active substances may alter the \n\nmetabolism of Ceplene and should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIt has been noted that neuromuscular blocking agents, narcotic analgesics, and various contrast media \n\ncan induce the release of endogenous histamine; therefore in patients undergoing diagnostic or \n\nsurgical procedures, the additive effect of Ceplene treatment should be considered prior to the \n\nprocedure (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential and sexually active men must use effective methods of contraception \n\nduring treatment with Ceplene and IL-2. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nFor Ceplene, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.  Animal studies showed \n\nreproductive toxicity but only at maternotoxic doses, and did not indicate direct harmful effects with \n\nrespect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see \n\nsection 5.3).  Ceplene in conjunction with IL-2 must not be used during pregnancy. \n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether histamine is excreted in human breast milk.  The excretion of histamine in milk \n\nhas not been studied in animals, but at maternotoxic doses in rats, offspring showed slight toxicity \n\nduring early lactation (see section 5.3).  Ceplene in conjunction with IL-2 must not be used during \n\nbreast-feeding.  \n\n \n\nRefer to the IL-2 SmPC for information on pregnancy and breast-feeding with IL-2.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo clinical data are available on the effects of Ceplene on fertility.  Animal studies revealed no \n\nadverse effects on fertility apart from a slight reduction in implantations and viable foetuses (see \n\nsection 5.3).   \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nCeplene has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Administration of Ceplene \n\ncan cause hypotension and may result in dizziness, light-headedness and blurred vision.  Patients \n\nshould not drive or operate machines for at least 1 hour after receiving Ceplene. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions were reported to be at least possibly related to IL-2 and Ceplene treatment in almost \n\nall patients in studies in AML. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe most common adverse reactions experienced by 30% or more of patients receiving IL-2 and \n\nCeplene (listed in descending order of frequency) were: flushing, headache, fatigue, injection site \n\ngranuloma, pyrexia and injection site erythema. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to the treatment of low-dose IL-2 with \n\nCeplene in AML studies (n=280 for the IL-2 and Ceplene treatment arm) are listed below by body \n\nsystem organ, class and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \n\nin order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common ( 1/10), common \n\n( 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n\n(< 1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations upper respiratory tract \ninfections \n\nVery common \n\npneumonia Common \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders \n\neosinophilia, thrombocytopenia Very common \nleucopenia, \n\nneutropenia \n\nCommon \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nanorexia Common \n\nPsychiatric disorders insomnia Common \nNervous system disorders headache, dizziness, dysgeusia Very common \nCardiac disorders tachycardia Very common \n\npalpitations Common \n\nVascular disorders flushing, hypotension Very common \nRespiratory, thoracic, and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\ncough, dyspnoea Very common \n\nnasal congestion Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhoea Very common \n\nvomiting, abdominal pain \n\nupper, dry mouth, gastritis, \n\nabdominal distention \n\nCommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nrash Very common \n\n erythema, hyperhidrosis, night \n\nsweats, pruritus \nCommon \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders \n\narthralgia, myalgia Very common \npain in extremity, back pain Common \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\ninjection site granuloma, \n\nfatigue, pyrexia, injection site \n\nerythema, feeling hot, injection \n\nsite reaction, injection site \n\npruritus, influenza like illness, \n\nchills, injection site \n\ninflammation, injection site \n\npain \n\nVery common \n\ninjection site urticaria, injection \n\nsite bruising, injection site rash, \n\ninjection site swelling, \n\nasthenia, chest pain \n\nCommon \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nOther oncology (advanced tumour) studies \n\n \n\nCeplene and low dose IL-2 have been investigated in other clinical studies at different doses (1 mg \n\nhistamine dihydrochloride twice a day) and with different dose regimens of low-dose IL-2 and \n\ninterferon-alfa.

It  \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare  \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nAdministration of Ceplene or IL-2 by rapid infusion or into vascular spaces, at higher doses than the \n\napproved ones, may exaggerate the adverse reactions associated with Ceplene.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, other immunostimulants, ATC code: L03AX14. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCeplene/IL-2 is an immunotherapy which aims to induce immune-mediated destruction of residual \n\nmyeloid leukaemic cells and thereby to prevent relapse of leukaemia.  The role of Ceplene is to protect \n\nlymphocytes, in particular NK cells and T cells, which are responsible for the immune-mediated \n\ndestruction of residual leukaemic cells.  The role of IL-2 is to promote the functions of NK cells and T \n\ncells by activating the anti-leukaemic properties of these cells and by expanding these cell populations \n\nby inducing cell cycle proliferation.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nThe mechanism by which Ceplene improves the anti-leukaemic function of lymphocytes in AML is \n\nnot completely established; it is considered to be by inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS or \n\n‘oxygen free radicals’), which are synthesised by monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes.  ROS are \n\nknown to limit the anti-leukaemic effects of lymphocyte activators such as IL-2, by triggering \n\ndysfunction and death by apoptosis in NK cells and T cells.  Ceplene inhibits NAPDH oxidase which \n\ninitiates the formation and release of ROS from phagocytes. By inhibiting oxidase function and \n\nreducing ROS production, Ceplene protects IL-2-activated NK cells and T cells from oxygen free \n\nradical-induced inhibition and apoptosis. The concomitant administration of Ceplene and IL-2 \n\ntherefore aims to optimise the anti-leukaemic functions of NK cells and T cells. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThere have been 2 clinical studies to evaluate the use of Ceplene in the maintenance of remission in \n\nadult AML patients.  Study AML-1 was exploratory, enrolling 39 AML patients in remission to \n\ndetermine the dose and feasibility of Ceplene administered together with IL-2.  Results of this pilot \n\nstudy were used to design and implement a multi-national phase 3 trial.  The randomised phase 3 trial \n\n(0201) compared Ceplene+IL-2 treatment to no treatment in 261 patients in first remission (CR1) and \n\nin another 59 patients in subsequent remission after relapse (CR>1).  For CR1 patients, the median \n\nduration of leukaemia-free survival increased from 291 days (9.7 months) to 450 days (15 months) \n\nafter Ceplene/IL-2 versus no maintenance treatment (Intention to Treat [ITT], p=0.01. n=261).  The \n\nnumber of CR1 patients remaining leukaemia-free for 3 years was 40% after Ceplene+IL-2 versus \n\n26% in patients not receiving this treatment (p=0.01). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nCeplene is indicated for use in adults. There are no data available on pharmacodynamic properties in \n\nchildren below 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that due to \n\nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \n\nproduct. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become \n\navailable every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.   \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nHistamine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection.  Maximum plasma concentration is \n\nreached approximately 10 minutes after end of subcutaneous infusion.  Histamine concentrations and \n\nPK were highly variable across studies, as well as within the normal volunteer and patient groups.   \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nPatients showed a higher degree of variability with respect to systemic exposure as compared to \n\nhealthy subjects. Overall systemic exposure of Ceplene was greater in patients versus healthy subjects. \n\nHowever, this difference was not statistically significant. \n\nIt is not known whether histamine crosses the placenta. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation/Elimination \n\n \n\nHistamine is eliminated by metabolism in kidney, liver and other tissues.  The main enzymes involved \n\nin the metabolism of histamine are HNMT (histamine-N-methyltransferase) and DAO (diamine \n\noxidase).  The metabolites are mainly excreted in urine.  The mean half-life was 0.75 to 1.5 hours in \n\npatients. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nThere are no significant effects of age or weight on the pharmacokinetic properties of histamine.  \n\nClearance of Ceplene is almost twice as high in females resulting in considerably lower systemic \n\nexposure than in males.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of histamine are similar in healthy volunteers with normal renal function \n\ncompared to volunteers with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.  In subjects with severe renal \n\nimpairment, there were decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at plasma histamine \n\nconcentrations which caused no appreciable decrease in blood pressure in other subjects.  Thus, \n\nsubjects with severe renal impairment may be more sensitive to the blood pressure lowering effects of \n\nexogenously administered histamine than subjects with normal renal function or subjects with mild or \n\nmoderate renal impairment.  Although the degree of renal impairment has little effect on the PK \n\ndisposition of histamine, caution should be used in the administration of histamine to patients with \n\nsevere renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nA study was performed to measure the PK of histamine in normal volunteers compared to patients \n\nwith mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment.  There were no clinically significant differences \n\nin safety parameters or in pharmacodynamics.  Plasma histamine concentrations were highly variable \n\nand were considerably higher in the groups of patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment \n\n(medians 10 and 5 times the normal volunteers respectively).  Patients with all degrees of hepatic \n\nimpairment may have tachycardia or hypotension for 30-60 minutes after Ceplene+IL-2 \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated-dose \n\ntoxicity, local tolerance and genotoxicity. Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at \n\nexposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure, indicating little \n\nrelevance to clinical use.  No carcinogenicity studies have been performed on Ceplene. \n\n \n\nHistamine dihydrochloride was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at doses resulting in several hundred-\n\nfold greater systemic exposures than the clinical exposure. In female rats dosed before mating to \n\ngestation day 7, slightly reduced numbers of implantations and viable foetuses were found, but without \n\nany dose-response and within the range of historical control data. In the peri-post natal development \n\nstudy, high doses of histamine dihydrochloride caused maternal toxicity, and the offspring showed \n\ntoxicity during lactation (fewer live pups at day 21 compared to lactation at day 4) but not after \n\nweaning.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Ceplene is and what is used for \n \n\nCeplene belongs to a group of medicines called immunomodulatory medicines.  These medicines help \n\nthe body’s immune system fight diseases like cancer by improving the immune system’s natural role \n\nin fighting disease.  The active substance in Ceplene is histamine dihydrochloride; it is identical to a \n\nnaturally occurring substance in the body.  It is used together with low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2), \n\nanother medicine which helps the immune system to fight diseases like cancer.  \n\n \n\nCeplene is used in adult patients, together with IL-2, to treat a particular type of leukaemia called \n\nacute myeloid leukaemia (AML) which is a cancer of blood forming cells in the bone marrow. It is \n\nused to maintain the remission (the period during which the disease is less severe or not detectable).  \n\nCeplene with IL-2 will help your immune system attack any remaining cancer cells after a previous \n\ncancer treatment.  \n\n \n\nDuring your treatment, you will always use IL-2 AND Ceplene.  Ask your doctor if you have any \n\nquestions about Ceplene or IL-2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ceplene \n \n\nDo not use Ceplene \n\n \n\n If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to histamine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n\n If you have severe heart problems. \n\n If you are receiving one of the following medicines:  \n- Steroids such as prednisone and dexamethasone.  They are used to inhibit activity of \n\nthe immune system (immunosuppressant) and to reduce inflammation.   \n\n- Clonidine, a medicine used to reduce high blood pressure. \n- H2 blockers such as cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine or nizatidine which are used to \n\ntreat stomach ulcers, indigestion (dyspepsia) or heartburn. \n\n If you have received a stem cell transplant (a kind of bone marrow transplant) from a donor.  \n\n If you are pregnant. \n\n If you are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Ceplene. \n\n \n\nCeplene and IL-2 are not to be injected at the same time. IL-2 has to be injected first. Ceplene must be \n\ninjected 1 to 3 minutes later. \n\n \n\nCeplene must be injected slowly in the layer of tissue just under the skin (subcutaneously), over a \n\nperiod of approximately 5 to 15 minutes.  Rapid injection can cause a drop in your blood pressure and \n\nmake you feel faint or even pass out. \n\n \n\nYou will start your treatment with Ceplene in the clinic under supervision of a doctor.  You must be \n\nmonitored to check how you respond to treatment.  Your doctor will check your blood pressure, pulse \n\nrate and lung function.  Your doctor will also carry out some blood tests during treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you have had one of the following conditions you will be monitored in the hospital during the next \n\ntreatment days or the next cycles of treatment: \n\n bleeding ulcers, \n\n stroke, \n\n narrowing of the arteries (systemic peripheral arterial disease), \n\n heart disease (for severe heart problems see above “Do not use Ceplene”), \n\n a history of auto-immune disease (a disease where the immune system attacks the body’s own \ncells or tissues, such as systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or \n\npsoriasis). \n\n \n\nIf you are taking any other medicines mentioned under “Other medicines and Ceplene” or if you are to \n\nhave an operation or special X-ray investigation requiring an injection, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have an infection, your doctor will closely monitor you.  If you have had an infection within \n\n14 days of starting this treatment which required you to take medicines to treat infections (antibiotics, \n\nantifungals or antivirals), your doctor will closely monitor you. \n\n \n\nIf you have kidney problems, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.  A decrease of blood \n\npressure may occur.   \n\n \n\nIf you have liver problems, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.  Your doctor may change \n\nyour dose.  \n\n\n\n25 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nCeplene use is not recommended in children and adolescents, as there is no information available \n\nabout using this medicine in this age group.   \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Ceplene \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking any of the following medicines, please be sure to discuss this with your doctor or \n\npharmacist before using Ceplene. Some of them must not be taken during treatment with Ceplene or \n\nmay need special precautions: \n\n Steroids such as prednisone and dexamethasone.  They are used to inhibit activity of the \nimmune system (immunosuppressant) and to reduce inflammation (see above “Do not use \n\nCeplene”). \n\n H2 blockers such as cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine or nizatidine. They are used to treat \nstomach ulcers, indigestion (dyspepsia) or heartburn (see above “Do not use Ceplene”).   \n\n Antihistamines used to treat allergy.  \n\n Certain anti-psychotics such as chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, thoridazine, clozapine and \nrisperidone.  They are used to treat mental conditions.  \n\n Tricyclic antidepressant medicines such as amitryptiline, imipramine, or monoamine oxidase \ninhibitors, such as phenelzine, isocarboxazide, tranylcypromine or moclobemide.  They are \n\nused to treat depression.  \n\n Anti-malarial or medicines used to treat infections responsible for sleeping sickness. \n\n Beta-blockers, such as propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol. They are used for angina and heart \nbeat disorders. \n\n Any treatment for high blood pressure (for example thiazide diuretics [bendrofluazide], ACE \ninhibitors [captopril], calcium antagonists [nifedipine] and alpha-blockers [prazosin]).  \n\n \n\nAlso, if you are to have an operation or special X-ray investigation requiring an injection, first make \n\nsure that your doctor knows that you are receiving Ceplene.  Certain medicines used for an operation \n\n(for example neuromuscular blocking medicines and narcotic pain-killers) or dyes used for certain X-\n\nrays may interfere with this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nThere is no information about the use of Ceplene in pregnant women. Therefore, the treatment with \n\nCeplene and IL-2 must not be used during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nFor both men and women using this treatment, an effective method of contraception must be used as it \n\nis important not to conceive a child while being treated with Ceplene and IL-2. \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether Ceplene appears in breast milk. Therefore Ceplene and IL-2 must not be used \n\nduring breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nDo not drive or use machines within one hour after receiving a Ceplene injection as it may reduce \n\nblood pressure causing dizziness, light-headedness and blurred vision. This can affect your ability to \n\ndrive and operate machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n3. How to take Ceplene \n \n\nAlways use Ceplene exactly as your doctor has instructed.  You should check with your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse if you are not sure about this. \n\n \n\nThis treatment must be prescribed and supervised by a physician with knowledge of acute myeloid \n\nleukaemia. \n\n \n\nRecommended dose \n\n \n\nSince you will be using both IL-2 and Ceplene in a combined treatment, information about both \n\ndosages is provided: \n\n \n\nInterleukin-2 (IL-2) \n\n \n\nIL-2 is injected twice daily as a subcutaneous injection (in the layer of tissue just under the skin) \n\n1 to 3 minutes before the injection of Ceplene.  Each dose is calculated from your body weight. Your \n\ndoctor will let you know how much it is and how to inject it.  \n\n \n\nCeplene \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Ceplene is 0.5 mL of solution twice a day given as a slow subcutaneous injection (in \n\nthe layer of tissue just under the skin).   \n\n \n\nCeplene must be injected 1 to 3 minutes after IL-2. \n\n \n\nThe two medicines, IL-2 and Ceplene, are both injected twice a day, with a minimum of 6 hours \n\nbetween injections. \n\n \n\nTreatment periods and treatment breaks \n\n \n\nThe treatment with IL-2 and Ceplene lasts for 81 weeks and is cyclic.  \n\n For the first 18 weeks: you will use IL-2 and Ceplene daily for 3 weeks, followed by a 3 week \nbreak (no treatment at all). \n\n For the following 63 weeks: you will use IL-2 and Ceplene daily for 3 weeks, followed by a  \n6 week break (no treatment at all). \n\n \n\nInjecting Ceplene yourself \n\n \n\nYour doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject IL-2 and Ceplene yourself.   \n\nYour doctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself.  Do not try to inject yourself unless a \n\nqualified professional has trained you.   \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that you always have someone with you when injecting this medicine, such as an \n\nadult family member, friend or other care provider who could help you if you feel light-headed or \n\nfaint.   \n\n \n\nFor further instructions on how to inject this medicine yourself, please read the section \n\n“INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELF-INJECTION OF CEPLENE” at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may advise you that it is appropriate to use a syringe pump to regulate the injection of \n\nCeplene.  If you are using a syringe pump you must refer to the instructions provided by the pump \n\nmanufacturer and the training provided by your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Ceplene than you should \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nYou must use this medicine exactly as it has been prescribed for you.  If you accidentally inject more \n\nthan you were told to, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Ceplene \n\n \n\nDo not take any additional dose to make up for the forgotten doses.  Continue with the treatment as \n\nprescribed.  If you have missed one of your doses in a day, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Ceplene \n\n \n\nIf you want to stop taking Ceplene you should try to consult your doctor in advance. Please inform \n\nyour doctor immediately if you have stopped taking Ceplene by your own decision.  \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

It is important that you do not try to give yourself the \n\ninjection unless you have received special training from your doctor or nurse.  If you are not sure \n\nabout how to give yourself the injection or you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for \n\nhelp.  \n\n \n\nIf you feel faint or dizzy during or after the injections, tell your doctor before injecting your next dose.  \n\nYour doctor may want to increase the time you take to complete your injection, or change your dose.   \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nYou will have to inject Ceplene and IL-2 twice a day by subcutaneous injection (in the layer of tissue \n\njust under the skin), according to the directions provided by your doctor.   \n\n \n\nAlways inject IL-2 first.  Ceplene must be injected 1 to 3 minutes later.   \n\n \n\nCeplene must not be mixed with any other products and must not be diluted. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will explain to you how to prepare and inject IL-2. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that you always have someone with you when injecting Ceplene, such as an adult \n\nfamily member, friend, or other care provider to help you if you feel light-headed or faint.   \n\n \n\nPREPARATION FOR INJECTION OF CEPLENE  \n\n \n\nTo prepare a dose of Ceplene you will need the following:  \n\n 1 vial of Ceplene solution (0.5 mL) \n\n 1 sterile graduated syringe with needle \n\n 1 alcohol wipe  \n \n\nMethod \n\n \n\n1 Take 1 vial out of the carton.  Check the expiry date (EXP) on the vial label.   \n\n2. Do not use if the date has passed the last day of the month shown. \n\n3. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n4. Double check the vial label to make sure you are using the correct medicine.  The solution must be \n\nclear and colourless.  If not, use another vial and inform your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n5. Remove the plastic cap from the vial, exposing the stopper with the inner rubber circle. \n\n6. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber part of the stopper.  Do not touch the stopper with your \n\nhands. \n\n7. Pick up the sterile syringe.  Notice the numbered marks on it.  Each mark (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.) \n\nrepresents one-tenth of a millilitre (0.1 mL).  With the needle cover on, pull back the plunger and \n\ndraw air into the syringe to the level (number of millilitres) instructed by your doctor.  See \n\nFigure 1. \n  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8. Pull the needle cover straight off.  With the vial standing on a flat surface, insert the needle straight \n\nthrough the rubber stopper into the vial. \n\n \n\n9. Push the plunger of the syringe down to inject air into the vial.  See Figure 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10 Holding both the vial and the syringe, turn the vial upside down.  Adjust the syringe so that the tip of \n\nthe needle is slightly above the rubber stopper but still within the solution.  See Figure 3. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11.  Slowly pull back the plunger to draw the solution into the syringe, filling it to the level (number \n\n of millilitres) instructed by your doctor.  If bubbles appear in the syringe, push the solution \n\n slowly back into the vial and withdraw the solution again. \n\n12  Take the needle out of the vial.  Do not lay the syringe down or let the needle touch anything. \n\n13.  Replace the cover on the needle.  Place the syringe on a clean flat surface. \n\n14.  There may be a small amount of solution left in the vial. This is to be returned to the pharmacist \n\nfor disposal.  \n\n  NOTE: The vial of Ceplene contains an overfill to facilitate the dose extraction of a single \n\n0.5 mL dose. \n\n15.  Double check the syringe to make sure that you have withdrawn the correct amount.  \n\n16.  Take the syringe and follow the “INSTRUCTIONS FOR INJECTION” information below.  \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR INJECTION \n\nFigure 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nYou will usually inject two doses of 0.5 mL in a day, unless your doctor has prescribed a lower dose \n\nfor you. \n\n \n\nFor the injection you will need the following:  \n\n 1 prepared syringe for your IL-2 injection (refer to the IL-2 package leaflet and your  \ndoctor’s dose instructions). \n\n 1 prepared syringe containing Ceplene. \n\n Alcohol wipe(s). \n\n A timer, clock or watch with a second hand. \n\n A puncture-proof container so you can dispose of used syringes safely. \n\n \n\nMethod \n\n \n\n1. Find a comfortable, well-lit place to sit and where you can lie back.  Place the pre-prepared \n\nsyringes containing IL-2, Ceplene and an opened alcohol wipe where you can reach them.  For \n\nyour safety it is very important that you are sitting where you can lean back or lie flat when you \n\nperform the injections. \n\n2. Inject IL-2 as you have been instructed. \n\n3. Wait 1 to 3 minutes. \n\n4. Decide where you will inject Ceplene.  You may choose the inner or outer thighs, arms or stomach.  \n\nCeplene and IL-2 must not be injected into the same region.  For example, if you inject IL-2 in \n\nthe left arm, you could inject Ceplene into the left or right thigh, the stomach, or the right arm.  \n\nAlways vary the site that you inject.  For possible injection sites, see Figure 4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n5. Make sure that the area of the skin you select is exposed.  Use an alcohol wipe to clean it.  Allow \n\nthe area to dry for 10 seconds. \n\n6. Pinch up a section of the cleaned skin between your thumb and forefinger, without squeezing it.  \n\nSee Figure 5.  \n\n \n\n   Figure 5 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7. Hold the needle either vertically (90°) or at a 45° angle to the skin and insert it under the skin as far \n\nas it will go in one quick motion.  The needle must be inserted under the skin, but not into any \n\nblood vessels below the skin.  See Figure 6. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8. Slightly pull back the plunger.  If blood appears, do not inject Ceplene because the needle has \n\nentered a blood vessel.  Withdraw and discard the syringe as instructed.  Obtain new supplies and \n\nstart the procedure over again, even if 3 minutes have passed after injection of IL-2. \n\n9. Notice the numbered marks on each syringe.  Each mark (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.) represents one-tenth of \n\na millilitre (0.1 mL). \n\n10. Push down the syringe plunger and inject one-tenth of a millilitre (0.1 mL) every minute, or more   \n\nslowly if instructed to do so by your doctor. See Figure 7.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11. Never inject Ceplene any faster or all at once. \n\n12. When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from your skin. \n\n13. Apply gentle pressure with the alcohol wipe over the injection site without rubbing it. \n\n14.
