PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nTAVLESSE 100 mg film-coated tablets \nApproximately 9.0 mm round, biconvex, dark orange film-coated tablet debossed \u201c100\u201d on one side \nand \u201cR\u201d on the other side.  \n \nTAVLESSE 150 mg film-coated tablets \nApproximately 7.25 mm x 14.5 mm oval, biconvex, light orange film-coated tablet debossed \u201c150\u201d on \none side and \u201cR\u201d on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1. Therapeutic indications \n \nTAVLESSE is indicated for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients \nwho are refractory to other treatments (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2. Posology and method of administration \n \nFostamatinib treatment should be initiated and remain under the supervision of a physician who is \nexperienced in the treatment of haematological diseases. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nFostamatinib dosing requirements must be individualised based on the patient\u2019s platelet counts. The \nlowest dose of fostamatinib to achieve and maintain a platelet count of at least 50,000/\u00b5L should be \nused. Dose adjustments are based upon the platelet count response and tolerability (see table 2). \n \nThe recommended starting dose of fostamatinib is 100 mg twice daily.  \n \nAfter initiating fostamatinib, the dose can be increased to 150 mg twice daily after 4 weeks based on \nplatelet count and tolerability. A daily dose of 300 mg daily must not be exceeded. \n \nMissed dose \nIn the case of a missed dose of fostamatinib, patients should take their next dose at its regularly \nscheduled time. \n \nDiscontinuation \n \nTreatment with fostamatinib should be discontinued after 12 weeks of fostamatinib therapy if the \nplatelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding. \n \nMonitoring and dose modifications \n \nFostamatinib dose modification is recommended based on tolerability and platelet counts. \nManagement of some adverse reactions may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation \n(see table 1 and table 2).  \n \nClinical haematology, blood pressure and liver function tests should be monitored regularly \nthroughout therapy with fostamatinib (see section 4.4.) and the dosing should be adjusted as outlined \nin table 1. For example, if a patient is on the maximum dose at the time of an adverse reaction, the first \ndose reduction would be from 300 mg/day to 200 mg/day. \n \nTable 1: Dose reduction schedule \n\nDaily Dose \nAdministered as: \n\nAM PM \n300 mg/day 150 mg 150 mg \n200 mg/day 100 mg 100 mg \n150 mg/day 150 mg1 --- \n100 mg/day2 100 mg1 --- \n\n1 Once daily fostamatinib should be taken in the morning. \n2 If further dose reduction below 100 mg/day is required, discontinue fostamatinib. \n \nThe recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are provided in table 2.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nTable 2: Recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions \nAdverse reaction Recommended action \n\nHypertension \nStage 1: systolic between \n130-139 or diastolic between \n80-89 mmHg \n\nInitiate or increase dose of antihypertensive medication for \npatients with increased cardiovascular risk, and adjust as needed \nuntil blood pressure (BP) is controlled. \nIf the BP target is not met after 8 weeks, reduce fostamatinib to \nnext lower daily dose (refer to table 1). \n\nStage 2: systolic at least 140 or \ndiastolic at least 90 mmHg \n\nInitiate or increase dose of antihypertensive medication, and \nadjust as needed until BP is controlled. \nIf BP remains 140/90 mmHg or higher for more than 8 weeks, \nreduce fostamatinib to next lower daily dose (refer to table 1). \nIf BP remains 160/100 mmHg or higher for more than 4 weeks \ndespite aggressive antihypertensive therapy, interrupt or \ndiscontinue fostamatinib. \n\nHypertensive crisis: systolic over \n180 and/or diastolic over \n120 mmHg \n\nInterrupt or discontinue fostamatinib. \nInitiate or increase dose of antihypertensive medication, and \nadjust as needed until BP is controlled. If BP returns to less than \nthe target BP, resume fostamatinib at same daily dose. \nIf repeat BP is 160/100 mmHg or higher for more than 4 weeks \ndespite aggressive antihypertensive treatment, discontinue \nfostamatinib.  \n\nHepatotoxicity \nAST/ALT is 3 x ULN or higher \nand less than 5 x ULN  \n\nIf patient is symptomatic (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal \npain): \nInterrupt fostamatinib. \nRecheck LFTs every 72 hours until ALT/AST values are no \nlonger elevated (below 1.5 x ULN) and total BL remains less \nthan 2 x ULN. \nResume fostamatinib at next lower daily dose (refer to table 1). \nIf patient is asymptomatic: \nRecheck LFTs every 72 hours until ALT/AST are below \n1.5 x ULN) and total BL remains less than 2 x ULN. \nConsider interruption or dose reduction of fostamatinib if \nALT/AST and TBL remain in this category (AST/ALT is 3 to 5 x \nULN; and total BL remains less than 2 x ULN). \nIf interrupted, resume fostamatinib at next lower daily dose (refer \nto table 1) when ALT/AST are no longer elevated (below \n1.5 x ULN) and total BL remains less than 2 x ULN. \n\nAST/ALT is 5 x ULN or higher \nand total BL is less than 2 x \nULN \n\nInterrupt fostamatinib. \nRecheck LFTs every 72 hours: \nIf AST and ALT decrease, recheck until ALT and AST are no \nlonger elevated (below 1.5 x ULN) and total BL remains less \nthan 2 x ULN; resume fostamatinib at next lower daily dose \n(refer to table 1). \nIf AST/ALT persist at 5 x ULN or higher for 2 weeks or more, \ndiscontinue fostamatinib.  \n\nAST/ALT is 3 x ULN or higher \nand total BL is greater than 2 x \nULN \n\nDiscontinue fostamatinib. \n\nElevated unconjugated (indirect) \nBL in absence of other LFT \nabnormalities  \n\nContinue fostamatinib with frequent monitoring since isolated \nincrease in unconjugated (indirect) BL may be due to UGT1A1 \ninhibition. \n\nDiarrhoea \nDiarrhoea Manage diarrhoea using supportive measures (e.g., dietary \n\nchanges, hydration and/or antidiarrhoeal medication) early after \nthe onset until symptom(s) have resolved.  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nAdverse reaction Recommended action \nIf symptom(s) become severe (Grade 3 or above), temporarily \ninterrupt fostamatinib. \nIf diarrhoea improves to mild (Grade 1), resume fostamatinib at \nthe next lower daily dose (refer to table 1). \n\nNeutropenia \nNeutropenia If absolute neutrophil count decreases (ANC less than \n\n1.0 x 109/L) and remains low after 72 hours, temporarily interrupt \nfostamatinib until resolved (ANC greater than 1.5 x 109/L). \nResume fostamatinib at the next lower daily dose (refer to \ntable 1). \n\nALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; BP = blood pressure; BL = bilirubin;  \nULN = upper limit of normal; ANC = absolute neutrophil count \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nFostamatinib should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment, monitoring of liver function throughout therapy with fostamatinib \nshould be done. Dose regimen adjustment according to platelet counts and tolerability may be required \n(see table 1 and table 2, and section 4.4).  \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.  \n \nPaediatric population \nFostamatinib should not be used in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age because of \nadverse reactions on actively growing bones observed in nonclinical studies (see section 5.3). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFostamatinib is for oral use. \n \nThe tablets should be taken twice daily, whole with or without food (see section 5.2). In the event of \ngastric upset, tablets may be taken with food. \n \n4.3. Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nPregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInformation is based on ITP placebo-controlled population unless specified.  \n \nExcipients:  \n \nTAVLESSE 100 mg film-coated tablets contains 23 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 1.2% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nTAVLESSE 150 mg film-coated tablets contains 34 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 1.7% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nHypertension \n \nOver the range of doses studied in healthy volunteers, the effect of R406 (the major active metabolite \nof fostamatinib) on BP appears to be dose-dependent and varies among subjects. In the ITP placebo-\ncontrolled population, increased blood pressure, including the development of hypertension, was \nreported in patients treated with fostamatinib. Hypertensive crisis occurred in 1 (1%) patient. Patients \nwith pre-existing hypertension may be more susceptible to the hypertensive effects of fostamatinib. In \nclinical studies, the blood pressure effects resolved within a week of discontinuing treatment.  \n \nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure should be monitored every two weeks until stable, then monthly, and \nadjust or initiate antihypertensive therapy to ensure maintenance of blood pressure control during \nfostamatinib therapy. If increased blood pressure persists despite appropriate therapy, the physician \nshould consider fostamatinib dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation (see section 4.2). \n \nLiver function test abnormalities and risk of hepatotoxicity \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies, laboratory testing showed maximum ALT/AST levels more than 3 x \nthe upper limit of normal (ULN) in 9% of patients receiving fostamatinib and no patients receiving \nplacebo.  \n \nSparse data suggest an increase risk of hyperbilirubinemia in patients with genetic polymorphisms of \nUGT1A1, e.g. Gilbert, the physician should monitor these patients frequently (see section 4.2). \n \nFor all patients, transaminases recovered generally to baseline levels within 2 to 6 weeks of dose-\nmodification. The physician should monitor liver function tests monthly during treatment. If ALT or \nAST increase more than 3 x ULN, the physician should manage hepatotoxicity by treatment \ninterruption, reduction or discontinuation. Concomitant total bilirubin increases greater than 2 X ULN \nshould lead to treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2). \n \nComplete blood counts (CBCs) \n \nThe physician should monitor CBCs, including platelet counts, monthly until a stable platelet count (of \nat least 50,000/\u00b5L) is achieved. Thereafter, the physician should continue to monitor CBCs, including \nneutrophils, regularly. \n \nDiarrhoea \n \nDiarrhoea is the most common adverse reaction with fostamatinib treatment, but severe diarrhoea \noccurred in 1% of patients. Patients should be monitored for the development of diarrhoea and \nmanaged by using supportive care measures (e.g., dietary changes, hydration and/or antidiarrhoeal \nmedication) early after the onset of symptoms. If diarrhoea becomes severe (Grade 3 or above), \nadministration of fostamatinib should be interrupted, reduced, or discontinued (see section 4.2). \n \nNeutropenia \n \nNeutropenia occurred in 7% of patients treated with fostamatinib; febrile neutropenia occurred in 1% \nof patients. Patients with neutropenia may be more susceptible to infections.  \n \nThe physician should monitor the absolute neutrophil count monthly. The physician should manage \ntoxicity with fostamatinib interruption, reduction or discontinuation (see section 4.2). \n \nInfections \n \nInfections, including pneumonia and respiratory tract infections, have been reported during clinical \ntrials (see section 4.8).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nThe patient should be monitored for infection during treatment. The benefit risk of continuing therapy \nduring an infection should be evaluated by the physician. \n \nBone remodeling \n \nSince fostamatinib was shown in vitro to not only target SYK but also other tyrosine kinases that are \ninvolved in the bone metabolism (e.g., VEGFR, RET), any potential untargeted effects on bone \nremodelling or formation remain undetermined, especially in patients with osteoporosis, patients with \nfractures or young adults where epiphyseal fusion has not yet occurred. Closer monitoring in these \npatients is therefore recommended. The benefit risk of continuing therapy during the healing of a bone \nfracture should be thoroughly evaluated by the physician. \n \n4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on fostamatinib \n \nConcomitant use of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer (600 mg once daily for 8 days) with a single \ndose of 150 mg fostamatinib decreased R406 AUC by 75% and Cmax by 59%. \n \nConcomitant use of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 inducers decreases exposure to R406, which \nmay result in reduced efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 \ninducers is not recommended. \n \nConcomitant use of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases exposure to R406 (the \nmajor active metabolite), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. The patient should be \nmonitored for toxicities of fostamatinib that may require dose reduction (see table 2) when given \nconcurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. For treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor of shorter \nperiods, e.g. antifungals or antibacterial treatment, dose reductions could be warranted from the \nbeginning of the additional treatment. A two-fold reduction in dose frequency (i.e. from 150 mg twice \ndaily to 150 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily to 100 mg once daily) of fostamatinib in the \npresence of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted. The physician should consider resuming the \nfostamatinib dose that was used prior to concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 2 to 3 days \nafter discontinuation of the inhibitor. \n \nConcomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (200 mg twice daily for 3.5 days) with a \nsingle dose of 80 mg fostamatinib (0.53 times the 150 mg dose) increased R406 AUC by 102% and \nCmax by 37%.  \n \nOther medicinal products with strong CYP3A4 inhibition potential when coadministered with \nfostamatinib are: \n \nboceprevir, cobicistat, conivaptan, danoprevir and ritonavir, elvitegravir and ritonavir, grapefruit \njuice, indinavir and ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir and ritonavir, paritaprevir and \nritonavir and (ombitasvir and/or dasabuvir), posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir and ritonavir, \ntelaprevir, tipranavir and ritonavir, troleandomycin, voriconazole, clarithromycin, diltiazem, \nidelalisib, nefazodone, nelfinavir \n \nConcomitant use of verapamil, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (80 mg three times daily for 4 days) \nwith a single dose of 150 mg fostamatinib increased R406 (the major active metabolite) AUC by 39% \nand Cmax by 6%. \n \nIncrease in gastric pH does not affect exposure of R406 \n \nCoadministration of fostamatinib with 150 mg ranitidine, an H2-blocker that increases gastric pH did \nnot have clinically relevant impact on R406 exposure.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nEffects of fostamatinib on other medicinal products \n \nCYP3A4 substrate  \nConcomitant use of fostamatinib may increase systemic exposure of some CYP3A4 substrate \nmedicinal products. Patients should be monitored for toxicities of CYP3A4 substrate medicinal \nproducts, that may require dose reduction when given concurrently with fostamatinib.  \n \nConcomitant use of simvastatin (single dose 40 mg) with fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice \ndaily increased simvastatin AUC by 64% and Cmax by 113% and simvastatin acid AUC by 66% and \nCmax by 83%. \n \nConcomitant use of midazolam (single dose 7.5 mg) with fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice \ndaily increased midazolam AUC by 23% and Cmax by 9%. \n \nConcomitant use of a combined hormonal contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol with \nfostamatinib 100 mg administered twice daily increased AUC by 28% and Cmax by 34%. \n \nBCRP and P-gp substrate \nConcomitant use of fostamatinib may increase concentrations of P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin) and \nBCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin). The toxicities of these drugs should be monitored as a dose \nreduction may be required when given concurrently with fostamatinib. For rosuvastatin, shift to \nanother treatment should be considered and for digoxin, additional therapeutic drug monitoring could \nbe necessary. \n \nConcomitant use of rosuvastatin (single dose 20 mg) with fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice \ndaily increased rosuvastatin AUC by 95% and Cmax by 88%. \n \nConcomitant use of digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice daily \nincreased digoxin AUC by 37% and Cmax by 70%. \n \nCYP2C8 substrate \nConcomitant use of fostamatinib does not affect the exposure of CYP2C8 substrate drugs. No dose \nadjustment of CYP2C8 substrate drug is necessary.  \n \nConcomitant use of pioglitazone (single dose 30 mg) with fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice \ndaily increased pioglitazone AUC by 18% and decreased Cmax by 17%. Hydroxyl-pioglitazone AUC \nand Cmax decreased by 10% and by 9%, respectively. \n \nEffect on warfarin \nSince SYK-inhibition may have potential effects on platelet aggregation, anticoagulant activity (e.g. \nINR) where relevant should be monitored when anticoagulants with narrow therapeutic index such as \nwarfarin, are co-administered with fostamatinib. \n \nCo-administration with JAK-inhibitor, TPO-RAs, rituximab and other immune-modulating agents has \nnot been investigated. \n \nIn vitro studies \n \nFostamatinib is an inhibitor of the human P-gp efflux transporter in vitro. \n \nCYP3A4 and UGT1A9 are involved in the metabolism of R406. R406 is a substrate of P-gp but not of \nother major transporters (OAT1/3, OCT2, OATP1B1/3, MRP2, and BCRP). R406 can inhibit \nCYP3A4 and BCRP, and can induce CYP2C8 activity. R406 is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and \nUGT2B7.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nR406 is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Inhibition of UGT1A1 may result in increased unconjugated \nbilirubin in the absence of other LFT abnormalities. Patients should be monitored for toxicity for drugs \nthat are metabolised extensively by UGT1A1. \n \nAlthough R406 shows no inhibitory activity against UGT2B7 in vitro and is considered as a weak \nUGT1A1 inhibitor in vivo, the effect on other UGTs has not been determined. The potential of PK \nDDI for co-administration with acetaminophen therefore remains undetermined. \n \n4.6. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and at least one \nmonth after the last dose. \n \nPregnancy \n \nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, fostamatinib can cause foetal \nharm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnant women should be advised about the potential \nrisk to a foetus  \n \nPregnancies occurring during clinical trials resulted in healthy newborns as well as \nstillbirths/spontaneous abortions and miscarriages (see sections 4.3 and 5.3).  \n \nIf a patient becomes pregnant while taking fostamatinib, therapy should be discontinued. Fostamatinib \nis contraindicated during pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether fostamatinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of fostamatinib \nmetabolites in milk (see section 5.3) A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding \nshould be discontinued during treatment with fostamatinib and for at least one month after the last \ndose.  \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effect of fostamatinib on human fertility. Based on the finding of reduced \npregnancy rates in animal studies, fostamatinib may affect female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \nStudies in animals have shown no adverse effect on male fertility. Given there is no evidence for \nmutagenic or clastogenic potential, there is no concern for male-mediated birth defects. \n \n4.7. Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFostamatinib is not expected to influence the ability to drive or to use machines. The patient should \navoid driving cars or using machines if feeling dizzy. \n \n4.8. Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn the ITP placebo-controlled studies, serious adverse drug reactions were febrile neutropenia, \ndiarrhoea, pneumonia, and hypertensive crisis, which each occurred in 1% of patients receiving \nfostamatinib. In addition, severe adverse reactions observed in patients receiving fostamatinib \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nincluded dyspnea and hypertension (both 2%); and neutropenia, arthralgia, chest pain, diarrhoea, \ndizziness, nephrolithiasis, pain in extremity, toothache, syncope and hypoxia (all 1%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are presented from the placebo-controlled clinical trials and organised according \nto primary system organ class (SOC) for each preferred term in MedDRA. The adverse reactions are \nranked by frequency within each SOC, and presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies \nare defined as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), \nrare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nTable 3: Tabulated list of the adverse reactions \nMedDRA SOC Frequency Adverse reactions \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Pneumonia \n\nCommon Upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory tract \ninfection, bronchitis, lower respiratory tract \ninfection, viral upper respiratory tract infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic \ndisorders \n\nCommon Neutropenia, febrile neutropenia \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Dizziness \nCommon Dysgeusia \n\nVascular disorders Very \nCommon \n\nHypertension \n\nUncommon Hypertensive crisis \nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Diarrhoea, nausea, frequent bowel movement \n\nCommon Abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain \nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nCommon Rash, rash erythematous, rash macular \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon Chest pain, fatigue, influenza like illness \n\nInvestigations Very common Alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate \naminotransferase increased, blood pressure (BP) \nincreased, BP diastolic abnormal, BP diastolic \nincreased, BP systolic increased, hepatic enzyme \nincreased, liver function test abnormal \n\nCommon Neutrophil count decreased \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with fostamatinib were hypertension, liver \nfunction test abnormaltities, diarrhoea, neutropenia and infections. \n \nHypertension \n \nIncreases in blood pressure were dose dependent in early studies with fostamatinib in healthy subjects \n(see section 4.4). Hypertension events were reversible within days after dose discontinuation in these \nsubjects.  \n \nIn the ITP placebo-controlled population, hypertension-related adverse reactions were reported for \n27.5% of patients receiving fostamatinib and 12.5% of patients receiving placebo in the placebo-\ncontrolled studies. Hypertension-related adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity, \nwith 2 patients receiving fostamatinib and 1 subject receiving placebo experiencing severe \nhypertension. Hypertensive crises was reported as a serious adverse reaction and occurred in 1 (1%) \npatient receiving fostamatinib. Dose modification (reduction or interruption) was required for 4 \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\npatients receiving fostamatinib and no placebo patients. Study drug was withdrawn due to a \nhypertension-related adverse reaction in 1 patient receiving placebo and no patients receiving \nfostamatinib.  \n \nApproximately 20% of patients receiving fostamatinib required at least 1 intervention for \nhypertension-related events: increase in antihypertensive medications and/or a new antihypertensive \nmedication.  \n \nLiver function test abnormalities and risk of hepatotoxicity \n \nMild to moderate increases in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) were observed in fostamatinib treated \nsubjects in phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, occurring more frequently at the higher doses tested \n(250 mg oral twice daily). These changes were mild and all were reversible (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn the ITP placebo-controlled population, transaminase elevation adverse reactions (ALT increased \nand AST increased) were reported in 11% and 9% of patients receiving fostamatinib. All transaminase \nelevations were mild or moderate in severity and dose modification (dose reduction or dose \ninterruption) was required in 8 patients. One patient discontinued fostamatinib due to a transaminase \nelevation (ALT increased); this event resolved after discontinuation of treatment.  \n \nIn the ITP placebo-controlled population, laboratory testing showed maximum ALT/AST levels more \nthan 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 9% of patients receiving fostamatinib and no patients \nreceiving placebo. Maximum ALT and/or AST levels were > 10 x ULN in 1 patient receiving \nfostamatinib. Transaminase elevations recovered to baseline levels within 2 to 4 weeks of dose \nmodification. The median (range) time to onset of transaminase elevation was 58 days (43 to 127), and \nthe median (range) duration of each event was 14.5 days (6 to 28 days). \n \nDiarrhoea \n \nGastrointestinal complaints, specifically noninfectious diarrhoea events, were among the most \ncommon adverse reactions reported in patients treated with fostamatinib throughout the clinical \ndevelopment program. Non-infectious diarrhoea events are considered definitely related to \nfostamatinib treatment (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled ITP population, noninfectious diarrhoea was the most commonly reported GI \ncomplaint, occurring in 31% of subjects receiving fostamatinib. Noninfectious diarrhoea events were \nmost frequently mild-to-moderate in severity. The majority of subjects with moderate diarrhoea \nreceived antidiarrhoeal agents (loperamide) to mitigate their symptoms. Severe diarrhoea was reported \nin 1% of patients receiving fostamatinib during the placebo-controlled period. Dose modification \n(interruption or reduction) was reported for approximately 5% of subjects receiving fostamatinib; \nhowever study drug was discontinued because of adverse events (AEs) of diarrhoea in a single \nfostamatinib subject during the placebo-controlled period.  \n \nApproximately 25% of patients receiving fostamatinib experienced noninfectious diarrhoea during the \nfirst 12 weeks of treatment during the placebo-controlled period. Among the patients receiving \nfostamatinib who had moderate or severe diarrhoea, the median time to the first occurrence of \nmoderate or severe diarrhoea was 57 days and the median duration of the events was approximately \n15 days.  \n \nNeutropenia \n \nIn the initial Phase 1 human subject study, it was observed that at higher fostamatinib doses (up to \n300 mg twice daily), the biologically active component of fostamatinib produced significant \nreductions in neutrophils, which were rapidly reversible upon discontinuation of therapy (see section \n4.4). The rapidity of the recovery suggested a compartment effect more than an effect on progenitors. \nThis effect on neutrophils was observed in all clinical programs. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nIn the placebo-controlled ITP population, neutropenia adverse reactions were reported for 7% of \npatients in the fostamatinib group and no patients in the placebo group. Most neutropenia adverse \nreactions were not associated with an infection and were mild or moderate in severity. Severe \nneutropenia was reported in 2 patients; 1 of these was a serious adverse reaction of febrile neutropenia \nthat was attributed to an unknown infection. Three patients required dose modification for neutropenia \nper protocol, and study drug was discontinued due to neutropenia in 1 patient. All neutropenia adverse \nreactions except 1 resolved by the end of the study.  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled ITP population, 2 patients receiving fostamatinib and no patients receiving \nplacebo had a decrease in neutrophils to between \u2265 0.5 and < 1.0 \u00d7 109/L. Seven patients receiving \nfostamatinib and 1 patient receiving placebo had neutrophil counts decrease to between \u2265 1.0 and \n< 1.5 \u00d7 109/L. No patient had a decrease in neutrophils to < 0.5 \u00d7 109/L. \n \nInfections \n \nIn the placebo-controlled ITP population, infection adverse reactions were reported in 30% of patients \nreceiving fostamatinib and 20% of patients receiving placebo (see section 4.4). Infections involving \nthe respiratory tract accounted for 60% of the adverse events in the fostamatinib group and 40% of the \nevents in the placebo group. No systemic opportunistic infections were reported in the fostamatinib \nprogram. Serious adverse reactions for infection were uncommon. Severe infection events included \npneumonia and influenza-like illness (1 patient each in the fostamatinib group) and sepsis (1 patient in \nthe placebo group). One patient in the fostamatinib group discontinued study treatment due to an \ninfection (pneumonia). Neutropenia was rarely associated with infection.  \n \nElderly population  \n \nOf the total number of patients in clinical studies of fostamatinib, 16.4% were 65 years of age and \nolder, while 2.4% were 75 years of age and older. In general, incidences of adverse reactions were \nhigher in the older population.  \n \nIn patients 65 years of age and older, 6 (21%) patients experienced serious adverse events and 5 (18%) \nexperienced adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal while in patients under 65 years of age, \n7 (9%) and 5 (7%) experienced serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment \nwithdrawal, respectively. In patients 65 years of age and older who received fostamatinib, 11 (39%) \npatients experienced hypertension versus 2 (18%) placebo compared to 17 (23%) in patients under \n65 years of age versus 4 (11%) placebo. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9. Overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with fostamatinib, and the amount of R406 cleared by \ndialysis is negligible. There has not been any experience of overdose in the clinical development \nprogram. In the event of an overdose, the physician should monitor the patient closely for signs and \nsymptoms of adverse reactions as described in section 4.2, and treat the reactions with supportive care.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, other systemic haemostatics. ATC code: B02BX09 \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \nMechanism of action \n \nFostamatinib mediates its activity effectively through its major metabolite, R406, which is a tyrosine \nkinase inhibitor with demonstrated activity against spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). R406 inhibits signal \ntransduction of B-cell receptors and Fc-activating receptors, which play a key role in antibody-\nmediated cellular responses. The fostamatinib metabolite R406 reduces antibody-mediated destruction \nof platelets. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of fostamatinib has been demonstrated in two Phase III, randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled studies (C788-047 and C788-048) in adult patients with previously treated \npersistent (3-12 months since diagnosis) or chronic (greater than 12 months since diagnosis) ITP.  \n \nRandomised, placebo-controlled studies \nA total of 150 patients with persistent or chronic ITP, who had an insufficient response to previous \ntreatment (which included corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, splenectomy, and/or a thrombopoietin \nreceptor agonists) were enrolled in two identical, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that were \nconducted in different countries.  \n \nFor each study, patients were randomised 2:1 to fostamatinib or placebo for 24 weeks; randomisation \nwas stratified with respect to prior splenectomy and severity of thrombocytopenia. Stable concurrent \nITP therapy (glucocorticoids [less than 20 mg prednisone equivalent per day], azathioprine, or \ndanazol) was allowed, and rescue therapy was permitted, if needed. All patients initially received \nstudy drug at 100 mg twice daily (or matching placebo). Based on platelet count and tolerability, dose \nescalation to 150 mg twice daily (or matching placebo) was undertaken in 86% of patients at Week 4 \nor later.  \n \nPatients enrolled in the placebo-controlled studies had a median age of 54 years old (range: 20 to \n88 years; median age in C788-047 was 57.0 and in C788-048 was 49.5 years), and the majority were \nfemale (61%) and were white (93%). Prior ITP treatments were varied (median of 3, range of 1-14), \nwith the most common including corticosteroids (94%), immunoglobulins (53%), and thrombopoietin \nreceptor agonists (TPO-RA) (48%). Most patients had chronic ITP (93%), with a median time since \nITP diagnosis of 8.5 years, and 35% had undergone splenectomy. At baseline, the median platelet \ncount was 16,000/\u00b5L (with almost half [45%] less than 15,000/\u00b5L) and 47% were on stable ITP \ntherapy. Of the 102 patients with ITP who received fostamatinib, 28 (27%) were 65 years of age and \nolder while 11 (11%) were 75 years of age and older. \n \nIn Study C788-047, 76 patients were randomised; 51 to the fostamatinib group and 25 to the placebo \ngroup. In Study C788-048, 74 patients were randomised; 50 to the fostamatinib group and 24 to the \nplacebo group. The efficacy of fostamatinib was based on the primary endpoint of stable platelet \nresponse (at least 50,000/\u00b5L on at least 4 of the 6 visits between Weeks 14 to 24). Study outcomes for \nC788-047 and C788-048 are shown in table 4. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nTable 4: Study outcomes from placebo-controlled clinical studies \n\nStudy \nOutcomes \n\nStatistical \nParameters \n\nStudy C788-047 Study C788-048 Pooled studies \nRefractory \npopulation6 \n\nFosta \n(N=51) \n\nPBO \n(N=25) \n\nFosta \n(N=50) \n\nPBO \n(N=24) \n\nFosta \n(N=101) \n\nPBO \n(N=49) \n\nFosta \n(N= 72) \n\nPBO \n(N=33) \n\nStable \nplatelet \nresponse1,2 \n\nn (%) 8 (16) 0 (0) 9 (18) 1 (4) 17 (17) 1 (2) 10 (14) 0 (0) \nCI 95% (5.7, 25.7) (0, 0) (7.4, 28.7) (0, 12.2) (9.5, 24.1) (0, 6.0) (5.9, 21.9) (0.0, 0.0) \np-value p3 = 0.0471 NS p3=0.0071 P3=0.0287 \n\nEligible for \nC788-0494 at \nWeek 125 \n\nn (%) 28 (55) 22 (88) 33 (66) 19 (79) 61 (60) 41 (84) 43 (60) 29 (88) \n\nCompleted \nstudy \n(Week 24) \n\nn (%) 12 (24) 1 (4) 13 (26) 2 (8) 25 (25) 3 (6) 16 (22) 1 (3) \n\n1 Includes all patients with platelet counts and excludes patients whose platelet counts were measured following \nrescue therapy after Week 10.  \n\n2 Stable platelet response was prospectively defined as a platelet count of at least 50,000/\u00b5L on at least 4 of the \n6 visits between Weeks 14 and 24. \n\n3 p-value from Fisher Exact test \n4 C788-049: open label extension study \n5 Patients who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks were eligible to enrol in open-label extension study. \n6 Refractory patient population defined as the subgroup of patients who had received three or more prior other \n\nITP therapies \nFosta = fostamatinib; PBO = placebo; NS = Did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between \n\ntreatment arms \n \nAn initial therapeutic response (platelet count \u2265 50,000/\u03bcL) was observed within 6 weeks for most \nresponders (11 of 17 responders) and within 12 weeks for all stable responders. \n \nAmong patients who were stable responders, the median platelet count increased to 95,000/\u00b5L across \npost-baseline visits with a maximum of 150,000/\u00b5L. Rescue medication was required by 30% and \n45% of patients receiving fostamatinib or placebo, respectively. \n \nDuring the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of bleeding occurred in 29% and 37% of patients \nin the fostamatinib and placebo arms, respectively. The incidence of moderate or severe \nbleeding-related adverse events (AEs) (16.3% vs. 9.9%) and serious adverse events (SAEs) (10.2% vs \n5.0%) was about twice as high in the placebo group compared with the fostamatinib group. Only one \nsubject treated with fostamatinib experienced a severe bleeding-related event (contusion), while three \nsubjects treated with placebo experienced severe events (gastrointestinal haemorrhage, menorrhagia \nand petechiae). In sum, there were trends for reduced bleeding-related AEs with fostamatinib \ncompared to placebo; differences between the groups were not statistically significant.  \n \nSubset analyses \nPlatelet count responses for patients treated with TAVLESSE were further analysed as shown in table \n5. Results are shown for both the pooled population (from Studies C788-047 and C788-048) and a \nrefractory patient population defined as the subgroup of patients who had received three or more prior \nother ITP therapies. For all platelet count parameters, the results for the pooled population are \ncomparable to the refractory patient population. \n \nTable 5: Summary of platelet count parameters by subgroup \u2013 pooled patient population \n\n(C788-047 and C788-048) and refractory patient population \n\nParameters \n\nPooled Population \nFostamatinib \n\nN=101 \n\nRefractory Patient Population \nFostamatinib \n\nN=72 \nSubject With Platelet Response (\u226550000/\u00b5L) at Week 12, n (%)  \n    Yes 23 (22.8%) 14 (19.4%) \n    No 78 (77.2%) 58 (80.6%) \nChange From Baseline in Platelet Count (/\u00b5L) at Week 12  \n    Median 4000 3000 \n    Range (-15000, 220000) (-5000, 159000) \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nMedian Platelet Count (/\u00b5L) Over Time  \n    Median 22000 16750 \n    Range (1000, 254500) (1000, 105500) \n \nExtension Study \nThe C788-049 trial is an open label extension study. Patients from C788-047 and C788-048 who \ncompleted 24 weeks of treatment, or who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks, were eligible to \nenrol in this study. Patients remained blinded to their treatment assignment from the previous study \n(fostamatinib or placebo), so their starting dose in this study was based on their final platelet count. \n \nFor the C788-049 trial, 123 patients were enrolled, 44 patients previously randomised to placebo and \n79 patients previously randomised to fostamatinib.  \n \nPlacebo Crossover: In a prospectively defined analysis, the 44 subjects treated with placebo in the \nprior study were evaluated for stable response for fostamatinib (from the first 24 weeks of the study) \nwith their placebo data as the comparator for this objective measure. Ten of these subjects (22.7%) \n(including a single subject who was classified as a placebo responder in the prior study) met the \ncriteria for stable response. Thus, the difference in response from fostamatinib compared with placebo \nwas 20.5% (95% CI = 8.5-32.4).  \n \nExtension: Among the patients who achieved stable response in C788-047, C788-048 and C788-049 \ntrials, 18 subjects maintained the platelet count of at least 50,000/\u00b5L for 12 months or longer. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nfostamatinib in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of thrombocytopenia for \npatients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), who have had an insufficient response to a \nprevious treatment (e.g., corticosteroids), (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2. Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, the prodrug fostamatinib is rapidly converted to its active metabolite \nR406, presumably via enzymes in the gut.  \n \nAfter oral administration of fostamatinib, the mean absolute bioavailability of R406 was 55% with \nhigh variability (range 30 \u2013 85 %). The median Tmax of R406 is approximately 1.5 hours (range: 1 to \n4 hours). Negligible levels of fostamatinib were found in plasma.  \n \nAfter a single 150 mg oral dose of fostamatinib, mean (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) exposure estimates \nof R406 are 550 (\u00b1 270) ng/mL for Cmax and 7080 (\u00b1 2670) ng/mL for AUC. R406 exposure is \napproximately dose proportional up to 200 mg twice daily (1.3 times the 150 mg dose). R406 \naccumulates approximately 2- to 3-fold upon twice daily dosing at 100\u2013160 mg (0.67 to 1.06 times the \n150 mg dose). \n \nDistribution \n \nFostamatinib is highly bound to plasma proteins (98.3% in human plasma) and distributes reversibly \ninto blood cells. The mean (\u00b1 SD) volume of distribution at steady-state of R406 is 256 (\u00b1 92) L. \n \nMetabolism \n \nFostamatinib is metabolised in the gut by alkaline phosphatase to the major active metabolite, R406. \nR406 is extensively metabolised, primarily through pathways of CYP450-mediated oxidation (by \nCYP3A4) and glucuronidation (by UDP glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]1A9). R406 is the \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\npredominant moiety in the systemic circulation, and there was minimal exposure to any R406 \nmetabolites. \n \nElimination/Excretion \n \nIn humans, the mean (\u00b1 SD) terminal half-life of R406 is approximately 15 (\u00b1 4.3) hours. \nApproximately 20% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine, primarily in the form \nof an N-glucuronide of R406. Renal elimination of parent drug was low. The remaining radioactivity \n(~80%) was recovered in the faeces, mainly represented by 2 major metabolites of R406.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nR406 pharmacokinetics is linear and exposure is approximately dose-proportional up to 200 mg twice \ndaily (1.3 times the 150 mg dose). R406 accumulates approximately 2- to 3-fold upon twice daily \ndosing at 100-160 mg (0.67 to 1.06 times the 150 mg dose). \n \nFood interaction  \n \nAdministration of fostamatinib with a high-calorie, high-fat meal (deriving approximately 150, 250, \nand 500\u2013600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively) increased R406 AUC by 23% \nand Cmax by 15%, indicating fostamatinib can be administered with or without food. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics analyses indicate fostamatinib is not altered based on age, sex, \nrace/ethnicity.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of fostamatinib is not altered in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance [CLcr] = 30 to < 50 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft Gault equation and end stage renal \ndisease requiring dialysis), or hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C). \n \n5.3. Preclinical safety data \n \nIn two fostamatinib 4-week rat studies (with the calcium and sodium salts), chondrodystrophy of the \nfemoral head was observed in some animals in the highest dose groups (that were still juvenile/young \nduring the treatment interval) and was not fully reversible by the end of the recovery period. \n \nIn a 1-month study in juvenile rabbits, fostamatinib produced growth plate dysplasia in the proximal \nfemur and femoro-tibial joint and reduced bone marrow cellularity in the femur and sternum at 30 and \n60 mg/kg/day. Increased degenerate/necrotic ovarian follicles occurred in females at all fostamatinib \ndose levels (including 10 mg/kg/day). The changes noted in the growth plates and ovaries are \nconsistent with an anti-angiogenic effect. \n \nFostamatinib was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in mice when administered daily by oral gavage \nat doses up to 500/250 mg/kg/day, and was not carcinogenic in rats when administered by oral gavage \nat 45 mg/kg/day. Fostamatinib and its major active metabolite (R406) were not mutagenic in an in \nvitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte \nchromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.  \n \nStudies in animals have shown no adverse effect on male fertility. Given there is no evidence for \nmutagenic or clastogenic potential, there is no concern for male-mediated birth defects. In a fertility \nstudy with oral fostamatinib, all mating (e.g., time to mating, breeding proficiency), sperm \nassessments (e.g., number and motility), and organ weight (e.g., paired testis weight) parameters in \nmale rats were unaffected by doses as high as 40 mg/kg/day. This dose yields an AUC of R406 \napproximately 3.8 times that of the MRHD. All mating and fertility parameters in female rats were \nunaffected by doses as high as 11 mg/kg/day. This dose would yield an AUC of R406 similar to that of \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nthe MRHD. A slight decrease in pregnancy rates and an increase in post-implantation loss were seen at \n25 mg/kg/day. This dose would yield an AUC of R406 2.6 times that of the MRHD. \n \nIn animal reproduction studies, administration of fostamatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during \norganogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-foetal mortality (post-\nimplantation loss), alterations to growth (lower foetal weights), and structural abnormalities \n(variations and malformations) at maternal exposures (AUCs) approximately 0.3 and 10 times the \nhuman exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) respectively. \n \nA slight decrease in pregnancy rates and an increase in post-implantation loss in female rats was \nobserved. Nonclinical studies have established that the administration of fostamatinib during \npregnancy can increase the risk of embryonic loss, retard growth, and promote specific malformations \nof the kidney (including agenesis) and associated urogenital (e.g. ureter) tissues, as well as \nvariations/malformations in major vessel and skeletal development. These effects are consistent with \nknown targets of fostamatinib, including Syk (target), VEGFR-2 (off target) and Ret-kinase (off \ntarget). Based on nonclinical studies, any latent issues with female fertility is not expected after \nfostamatinib is withdrawn. \n \nIn pregnant rats and rabbits, R406 was found to cross the placenta. In general, the maternal plasma \nR406 concentrations were greater than the foetal plasma R406 concentrations. \n \nIn rodents, R406 was detected in maternal milk in concentrations 5- to 10-fold higher than in maternal \nplasma. \n \n \n6.

What TAVLESSE is and what it is used for \n \nWhat TAVLESSE is \nTAVLESSE contains the active substance fostamatinib. It specifically targets an enzyme called spleen \ntyrosine kinase, that plays an important part in the destruction of platelets. In this way TAVLESSE \nlimits platelet destruction by the immune system and increases platelet count in the body. This helps \nreduce the risk of severe bleeding. \n \nWhat TAVLESSE is used for \nTAVLESSE is used to treat adults with low platelet counts due to chronic immune thrombocytopenia \n(ITP) when an earlier treatment for ITP has not worked well enough. ITP is an autoimmune disease, in \nwhich the body\u2019s own immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood. Platelets are needed \nto help create clots and stop bleeding. \n \n2.
