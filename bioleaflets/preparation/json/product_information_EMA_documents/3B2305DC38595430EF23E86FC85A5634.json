NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAccofil 30 MU/0.5 ml solution for injection or infusion in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains 60 million units (MU) (equivalent to 600 micrograms [μg]) of filgrastim.  \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 MU (equivalent to 300 micrograms of filgrastim in 0.5 ml solution \nfor injection or infusion. \n \nFilgrastim is a recombinant methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor produced in \nEscherichia coli (BL21) by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect  \n \nEach ml of solution contains 50 mg of sorbitol (E420) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection or infusion  \n \nClear, colourless solution \n \n \n4. CLINCAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAccofil is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile \nneutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the \nexception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the \nduration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow \ntransplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and \nefficacy of Accofil are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.  \n \nAccofil is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). \n \nIn patients, children or adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term \nadministration of Accofil is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and \nduration of infection-related events. \n \nAccofil is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 x 109/L) \nin patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other \noptions to manage neutropenia are inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAccofil therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience in \ngranulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment and haematology and has the necessary \ndiagnostic facilities. The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nwith an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the \nmonitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed.  \n \nPosology  \n \nEstablished cytotoxic chemotherapy  \nThe recommended dose of filgrastim is 0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day). The first dose of \nAccofil should not be administered less than 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy. In \nrandomised clinical trials, a subcutaneous dose of 230 microgram/m2/day (4.0 to 8.4 \nmicrogram/kg/day) was used. \n \nDaily dosing with filgrastim should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the \nneutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Following established chemotherapy for solid \ntumours, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukaemias, it is expected that the duration of treatment required \nto fulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days. Following induction and consolidation treatment for acute \nmyeloid leukaemia the duration of treatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 days) depending on \nthe type, dose and schedule of cytotoxic chemotherapy used.  \n \nIn patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen \n1-2 days after initiation of filgrastim therapy. However, for a sustained therapeutic response, filgrastim \ntherapy should not be discontinued before the expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil count has \nrecovered to the normal range. Premature discontinuation of filgrastim therapy, prior to the time of the \nexpected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended.  \n \nIn patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation  \nThe recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 micrograms/kg/day). The first \ndose of filgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least \n24 hours after bone marrow infusion.  \n \nOnce the neutrophil nadir has been passed, the daily dose of filgrastim should be titrated against the \nneutrophil response as follows: \n \n\nNeutrophil count  Filgrastim dose adjustment  \n> 1.0 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days  Reduce to 0.5 MU (5µg) /kg/day  \nThen, if ANC remains > 1.0 x 109/L for 3 \nmore consecutive days  \n\nDiscontinue filgrastim \n\nIf the ANC decreases to < 1.0 x 109/L during the treatment period, the dose of filgrastim should \nbe re-escalated according to the above steps  \n\nANC = absolute neutrophil count \n \nFor mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in patients undergoing \nmyelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation  \nThe recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1.0 MU (10 \nµg)/kg/day for 5-7 consecutive days. The timing of leukapheresis: 1 or 2 leukaphereses on days 5 and \n6 are often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses may be necessary. Filgrastim \ndosing should be maintained until the last leukapheresis.  \n \nThe recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is \n0.5 MU (5 µg)/kg/day given daily from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the \nexpected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. \nLeukapheresis should be performed during the period when the ANC rises from  \n< 0.5 x 109/L to > 5.0 x 109/L. For patients who have not had extensive chemotherapy, one \nleukapheresis is often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses are recommended. \n \nFor the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation  \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nFor PBPC mobilisation in normal donors, filgrastim should be administered at 1.0 MU (10 µg)/kg/day \nfor 4 - 5 consecutive days. Leukapheresis should be started at day 5 and continued until day 6 if \nneeded in order to collect 4 x 106\n\n \nCD34+ cells/kg recipient bodyweight.  \n\n \nIn patients with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN)  \nCongenital neutropenia \nThe recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU (12 µg)/kg/day as a single dose or in divided doses.  \n \nIdiopathic or cyclic neutropenia \nThe recommended starting dose is 0.5 MU (5 µg)/kg/day as a single dose or in divided doses.  \n \nDose adjustments \nFilgrastim should be administered daily by subcutaneous injection until the neutrophil count has \nreached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 109/L. When the response has been obtained, the \nminimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established. Long-term daily administration is \nrequired to maintain an adequate neutrophil count. After one to two weeks of therapy, the initial dose \nmay be doubled or halved depending upon the patient's response. Subsequently, the dose may be \nindividually adjusted every 1-2 weeks to maintain the average neutrophil count between 1.5 x 109/L \nand 10 x 109/L.A faster schedule of dose escalation may be considered in patients presenting with \nsevere infections. In clinical studies, 97% of patients who responded had a complete response at doses \nof ≤ 24 µg/kg/day. The long-term safety of administration of filgrastim at doses above 24 µg/kg/day) \nin patients with SCN has not been established.  \n \nIn patients with HIV infection  \nFor reversal of neutropenia  \nThe recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 0.1 MU (1 µg)/kg/day, with titration up to a maximum \nof 0.4 MU (4 µg)/kg/day until a normal neutrophil count is reached and can be maintained (ANC > 2.0 \nx 109/L). In clinical studies, more than 90% of patients responded at these doses, achieving a reversal \nof neutropenia in a median of 2 days.  \n \nIn a small number of patients (< 10%), doses up to 1.0 MU(10 µg)/kg/day were required to achieve \nreversal of neutropenia. \n \nFor maintenance of normal neutrophil counts  \nWhen reversal of neutropenia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose to maintain a normal \nneutrophil count should be established. Initial dose adjustment to alternate day dosing with 30 MU \n(300 µg)/day is recommended. Further dose adjustment may be necessary, as determined by the \npatient's ANC, to maintain the neutrophil count at > 2.0 x 109/L. In clinical studies, dosing with 30 \nMU (300 µg)/day on 1 - 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 109/L, with the \nmedian dose frequency being 3 days per week. Long-term administration may be required to maintain \nthe ANC > 2.0 x 109/L.  \n \nSpecial population \nElderly  \nClinical trials with filgrastim have included a small number of elderly patients but special studies have \nnot been performed in this group and therefore specific posology recommendations cannot be made. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nStudies of filgrastim in patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function demonstrate that it \nexhibits a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals. \nDose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.  \n \nPaediatric patients in the SCN and cancer settings  \nSixty-five percent of patients studied in a SCN trial program were under 18 years of age. The efficacy \nof the treatment was clear for this age group, which included most patients with congenital \nneutropenia. There were no differences in the safety profiles for paediatric patients treated for SCN. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \nsimilar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \nThe dosage recommendations in paediatric patients are the same as those in adults receiving \nmyelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nEstablished cytotoxic chemotherapy  \nFilgrastim may be administered as a daily subcutaneous injection or alternatively as a daily \nintravenous infusion diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution over 30 minutes. For further \ninstructions on dilution prior to infusion see section 6.6. The subcutaneous route is preferred in most \ncases. There is some evidence from a study of single dose administration that intravenous dosing may \nshorten the duration of effect. The clinical relevance of this finding to multiple dose administration is \nnot clear. The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical circumstance.  \n \nPatients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation  \nFilgrastim is administered as an intravenous short-term infusion over 30 minutes or as a subcutaneous \nor intravenous continuous infusion over 24 hours, in each case after dilution in 20 ml of glucose 50 \nmg/ml (5%) solution. For further instructions on dilution with glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution prior to \ninfusion see section 6.6.  \n \nIn patients with mobilisation of PBPC  \nFilgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone \nFilgrastim may be given as a 24 hour subcutaneous continuous infusion or subcutaneous injection. For \ninfusions filgrastim should be diluted in 20ml of 5% glucose solution (see section 6.6).  \n \nFilgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy \nFilgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n \nFilgrastim for PBPCs for mobilisation in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation \nFilgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn patients with SCN \nFor congenital, idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia, filgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn patients with HIV infection  \nFor the reversal of neutropenia and maintenance of normal neutrophil counts in patients with HIV \ninfection, filgrastim is administered subcutaneously.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs), the trade \nname of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file.  \n \nSpecial warnings and precautions across indications \n \nFilgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established \ndosage regimens. \n \nFilgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia who develop \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nleukaemia or have evidence of leukaemic evolution. \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \nbeen reported in patients treated with filgrastim. Permanently discontinue filgrastim in patients with \nclinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer filgrastim to patients with a history of \nhypersensitivity to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.  \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \nantibodies against filgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present. \n  \nSpecial precautions in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) \n \nMalignant cell growth \nG-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-\nmyeloid cells in vitro. \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome or Chronic myeloid leukemia \nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or \nchronic myelogenous leukaemia have not been established. Therefore, filgrastim is not indicated for \nuse in these conditions. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast \ntransformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. \n \nAcute myeloid leukaemia \nIn view of limited safety and efficacy data in patients with secondary AML, filgrastim should be \nadministered with caution. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in de novo AML \npatients aged < 55 years with good cytogenetics [t (8; 21), t (15; 17), and inv (16)] have not been \nestablished. \n \nOther special precautions \nOsteoporosis \nMonitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases \nwho undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months. \n \nPulmonary adverse effects \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF \nadministration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher \nrisk. The onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological \nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of \nAdult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Filgrastim should be discontinued and appropriate \ntreatment given in these cases. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration, \nand is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hemoconcentration. Patients \nwho develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard \nsymptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n \nGlomerulonephritis \nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nSpecial precautions in cancer patients \n \nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \nCases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported uncommonly following administration \nof filgrastim. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. Individuals receiving filgrastim who report left \nupper abdominal and/ or shoulder tip pain should be evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic \nrupture. Dose reductions of Filgrastim have been noted to slow or stop the progression of splenic \nenlargement in patients with severe chronic neutropenia, and in 3% of patients a splenectomy was \nrequired. \n \nLeukocytosis \nWhite blood cell counts of 100 x 109/L or greater have been observed in less than 5% of patients \nreceiving filgrastim at doses above 0.3 MIU/kg/day (3 µg/kg/day). No undesirable effects directly \nattributable to this degree of leukocytosis have been reported. However, in view of the potential risks \nassociated with severe leukocytosis, a white blood cell count should be performed at regular intervals \nduring filgrastim therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/L after the expected nadir, filgrastim \nshould be discontinued immediately. However, during the period of administration of filgrastim for \nPBPC mobilisation, filgrastim should be discontinued or its dosage should be reduced if the leukocyte \ncounts rise to > 70 x 109/L. \n \nRisks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy \nSpecial caution should be used when treating patients with high dose chemotherapy because improved \ntumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic agents may \nlead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic and dermatologic effects (please \nrefer to the prescribing information of the specific chemotherapy agents used). \n \nEffect of chemotherapy on erythrocytes and thrombocytes \nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy. Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy \n(e.g. full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should \nbe taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to \ncause severe thrombocytopenia. \n \nThe use of filgrastim-mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of \nthrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy. \n \nOther special precautions \nThe effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been \nstudied. Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil \ncounts. Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors, neutrophil response may be diminished (such \nas those treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration \nby tumour). \n \nVascular disorders, including veno-occlusive disease and fluid volume disturbances, have been \nreported occasionally in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation. \n \nThere have been reports of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF \nafter allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient abnormal bone scans. This should be considered when interpreting bone-\nimaging results. \n \nSpecial precautions in patients undergoing PBPC mobilization \n \nMobilization of PBPC \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nThere are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods \n(filgrastim alone, or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient \npopulation. The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of \nCD34+ cells mean that direct comparison between different studies is difficult. It is therefore difficult \nto recommend an optimal method. The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in relation \nto the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient.  \n \nPrior exposure to cytotoxic agents \nPatients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy may not show sufficient \nmobilisation of PBPC to achieve the recommended minimum yield (2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) or \nacceleration of platelet recovery to the same degree. \n \nSome cytotoxic agents exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool and may \nadversely affect progenitor mobilisation. Agents such as melphalan, carmustine (BCNU) and \ncarboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor mobilisation, \nmay reduce progenitor yield. However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or carmustine \n(BCNU) together with filgrastim has been shown to be effective for progenitor mobilisation. When \nperipheral blood progenitor cell transplantation is envisaged it is advisable to plan the stem cell \nmobilization procedure early in the treatment course of the patient. Particular attention should be paid \nto the number of progenitors mobilised in such patients before the administration of high-dose \nchemotherapy. If yields are inadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms of \ntreatment not requiring progenitor support should be considered. \n \nAssessment of progenitor cell yields \nIn assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular \nattention should be paid to the method of quantitation. The results of flow cytometric analysis of \nCD34+ cell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and therefore, recommendations \nof numbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution. \n \nStatistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34+ cells re-infused and the rate of \nplatelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship. \n \nThe recommendation of a minimum yield of ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg is based on published \nexperience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution. Yields in excess of this minimum yield \nappear to correlate with more rapid recovery; those below with slower recovery. \n \nSpecial precautions in normal donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization \n \nMobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be \nconsidered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. \n \nPBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory \neligibility criteria for stem cell donation. Particular attention should be paid to haematological values \nand infectious diseases. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim has not been assessed in normal donors \nless than 16 years or greater than 60 years of age.  \n \nThrombocytopenia \nThrombocytopenia has been reported very commonly in patients receiving filgrastim .Platelet counts \nshould therefore be monitored closely.  \n \nTransient thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 109/L) following filgrastim administration and \nleukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied. Among these, two cases of platelets < 50 x \n109/L were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure. If more than one leukapheresis is \nrequired, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets < 100 x 109/L prior to \nleukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets are < 75 x 109/L.  \n \nLeukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nin haemostasis. Filgrastim administration should be discontinued or its dosage should be reduced if the \nleukocyte counts rise to > 70 x 109/L. Donors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be \nmonitored until haematological indices return to normal.  \n \nTransient cytogenetic abnormalities have been observed in normal donors following G-CSF use. The \nsignificance of these changes is unknown. Nevertheless, a risk of promotion of a malignant myeloid \nclone cannot be excluded. It is recommended that the apheresis centre perform a systematic record and \ntracking of the stem cell donors for at least 10 years to ensure monitoring of long-term safety. \n \nCommon but generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and uncommon cases of splenic rupture \nhave been reported in healthy donors and patients following administration of G-CSFs. Some cases of \nsplenic rupture were fatal. Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical \nexamination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in donors and/or \npatients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain.  \n \nIn normal donors, dyspnoea has been reported commonly and other pulmonary adverse events \n(haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhage, lung infiltrates, and hypoxia) have been reported \nuncommonly. In case of suspected or confirmed pulmonary adverse events, discontinuation of \ntreatment with filgrastim should be considered and appropriate medical care given.  \n \nSpecial precautions in recipients of allogeneic PBPC mobilised with filgrastim \n \nCurrent data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the \nrecipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with \nbone marrow transplantation. \n \nSpecial precautions in SCN patients \n \nBlood cell counts \nThrombocytopenia has been reported commonly in patients receiving filgrastim. Platelet counts should \nbe monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Consideration should \nbe given to intermittent cessation or decreasing the dose of filgrastim in patients who develop \nthrombocytopenia, i.e. platelets consistently < 100,000/mm3. \nOther blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, \nwhich require close monitoring of cell counts. \n \nTransformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome \nSpecial care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic \ndisorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia and myeloid leukaemia. Complete blood cell \ncounts with differential and platelet counts and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and \nkaryotype should be performed prior to treatment. \n \nThere was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in \nclinical trial patients with SCN treated with filgrastim. This observation has only been made in \npatients with congenital neutropenia. MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease \nand are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy. A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had \nnormal cytogenetic evaluations at baseline was subsequently found to have abnormalities, including \nmonosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation. If patients with SCN develop abnormal cytogenetics, the \nrisks and benefits of continuing filgrastim should be carefully weighed; filgrastim should be \ndiscontinued if MDS or leukaemia occurs. It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of \npatients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic \ntransformation. It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow \nexaminations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months). \n \nOther special precautions \nCauses of transient neutropenia such as viral infections should be excluded. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nCases of splenomegaly have been reported very commonly and cases of splenic rupture have been \nreported commonly following administration of filgrastim. Individuals receiving filgrastim who report \nleft upper abdominal and/ or shoulder tip pain should be evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic \nrupture. \n \n Splenomegaly is a direct effect of treatment with filgrastim. Thirty-one percent (31%) of patients in \nstudies were documented as having palpable splenomegaly. Increases in volume, measured \nradiographically occurred early during filgrastim therapy and tended to plateau later in treatment. Dose \nreductions were noted to slow or stop the progression of splenic enlargement and in 3% of patients a \nsplenectomy was required. Spleen size should be evaluated regularly. Abdominal palpation should be \nsufficient to detect abnormal increases in splenic volume. \n \nHaematuria was common and proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients. Regular urinalysis \nshould be performed to monitor this event. \n \nThe safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been \nestablished. \n \nSpecial precautions in patients with HIV infection \n \nCases of splenomegaly have been reported  commonly following administration of filgrastim. \nIndividuals receiving filgrastim who report left upper abdominal and/ or shoulder tip pain should be \nevaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. \n \nBlood cell counts \nANC should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Some \npatients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in neutrophil count to the initial \ndose of filgrastim. It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for the first 2 to 3 days of \nfilgrastim administration. Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is measured at least twice \nweekly for the first two weeks and subsequently once per week or once every other week during \nmaintenance therapy. During intermittent dosing with 30 MU (300 microgram)/day of filgrastim, there \ncan be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time. In order to determine a patient's trough or \nnadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement immediately prior \nto any scheduled dosing with filgrastim. \n \nRisk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medicinal products \nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \nmyelosuppressive medicinal products. As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater \nnumber of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of \ndeveloping thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see \nabove). \n \nInfections and malignancies causing myelosuppression \nNeutropenia may be due to bone marrow infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium \navium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma. In patients with known bone marrow-infiltrating \ninfections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition in \naddition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia. The effects of filgrastim on \nneutropenia due to bone marrow-infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established. \n \nSpecial precautions in sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease \n \nSickle cells crises, in some cases fatal, have been reported with the use of filgrastim in subjects with \nsickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of \nfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease and only after careful evaluation of the \npotential risks and benefits. \n \nAll patients \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \nAccofil contains sorbitol (E420) as an excipient at a concentration of 50 mg/ml. Patients with rare \nhereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not use this medicinal product. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \nmarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic \nchemotherapy have not been definitively established. In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing \nmyeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended \nin the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence from a small \nnumber of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5-Fluorouracil indicates that the severity \nof neutropenia may be exacerbated. \n \nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been \ninvestigated in clinical trials. \n \nSince lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, it is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim. \nAlthough this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an \ninteraction is harmful. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity. An increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed in rabbits at \nhigh multiples of the clinical exposure and in the presence of maternal toxicity (see section 5.3). There \nare reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women has been \ndemonstrated.  \nFilgrastim is not recommended   during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether filgrastim or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-\nfeeding child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from filgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \nand the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nFilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAccofil may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nDizziness may occur following the administration of Accofil (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during Filgrastim treatment include: anaphylactic \nreaction, serious pulmonary adverse events (including interstitial pneumonia and ARDS), capillary \nleak syndrome, severe splenomegaly/splenic rupture, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome or \nleukaemia in SCN patients, GvHD in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transfer or peripheral \nblood cell progenitor cell transplant and sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. \n  \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain (which includes \nbone pain, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal \nchest pain, neck pain), anaemia, vomiting, and nausea. In clinical trials in cancer patients \nmusculoskeletal pain was mild or moderate in 10%, and severe in 3% of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe data in the tables below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical trials and spontaneous \nreporting.

These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant \ndiseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medications or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). \n \nIn randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies, filgrastim did not increase the incidence of \nundesirable effects associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. In those clinical trials, undesirable effects \nreported with equal frequency in cancer patients treated with filgrastim/chemotherapy and \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nplacebo/chemotherapy included nausea and vomiting, alopecia, diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia, mucositis, \nheadache, cough, skin rash, chest pain, generalised weakness, sore throat, constipation and pain. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim. \nThe mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving filgrastim is unknown. The frequency is estimated \nas uncommon from clinical trial data.  \n \nSweets syndrome \nCases of Sweets syndrome (acute febrile dermatosis) have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \nThe frequency is estimated as uncommon from clinical trial data.  \n \nPulmonary adverse events \nIn clinical studies and the post-marketing setting pulmonary adverse effects including interstitial lung \ndisease, pulmonary oedema, and lung infiltration have been reported in some cases with an outcome of \nrespiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see section 4.4)  \n \nSplenomegaly and Splenic rupture \nCases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported uncommonly following administration \nof filgrastim. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal (see section 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity-type reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea and \nhypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment in clinical studies and in post-marketing \nexperience. Overall, reports were more common after intravenous administration. In some cases, \nsymptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. Filgrastim should be \npermanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.  \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, isolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with \nsickle cell disease (see section 4.4). The frequency is estimated as uncommon from clinical trial data. \n \nCutaneous vasculitis \nCutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with Filgrastim. The mechanism of \nvasculitis in patients receiving Filgrastim is unknown. During long term use cutaneous vasculitis has \nbeen reported in 2% of SCN patients. \n \nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) \nPseudogout has been reported in cancer patients treated with filgrastim, and the frequency is estimated \nas uncommon from clinical trial data. \n \nLeukocytosis \nLeukocytosis (WBC > 50 x 109/L) was observed in 41% of donors and transient thrombocytopenia \n(platelets < 100 x 109/L) following filgrastim treatment and leukapheresis was observed in 35% of \ndonors.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \nsimilar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy suggesting no age-related \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. The only consistently reported adverse event was \nmusculoskeletal pain which is no different from the experience in the adult population. \nThere is insufficient data to further evaluate filgrastim use in paediatric subjects. \n \nOther special populations  \n \nGeriatric use \nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects over 65 years of age \ncompared to younger adult (>18 years of age) subjects receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and clinical \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nexperience has not identified differences in the responses between elderly and younger adult patients. \nThere are insufficient data to evaluate Accofil use in geriatric subjects for other approved Accofil \nindications.  \n \nPaediatric SCN patients \nCases of decreased bone density and osteoporosis have been reported in paediatric patients with severe \nchronic neutropenia receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim.  \n  \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of Accofil overdose have not been established. Discontinuation of filgrastim therapy \nusually results in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days, with a return to normal \nlevels in 1 to 7 days. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors, ATC code: L03AA02 \nAccofil is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nHuman G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils \nfrom the bone marrow. Accofil containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in \nperipheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some SCN \npatients, filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and \nbasophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia \nalready prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses. \nNeutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by \ntests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating \nneutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.  \n \nUse of filgrastim in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to significant reductions in the \nincidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Treatment with filgrastim \nsignificantly reduces the duration of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospitalisation after \ninduction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myeloablative therapy followed by bone \nmarrow transplantation. The incidence of fever and documented infections were not reduced in either \nsetting. The duration of fever was not reduced in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed \nby bone marrow transplantation.  \n \nUse of filgrastim, either alone, or after chemotherapy, mobilises haematopoietic progenitor cells into \nperipheral blood. These autologous PBPCs may be harvested and infused after high-dose cytotoxic \ntherapy, either in place of, or in addition to bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of PBPCs \naccelerates haematopoietic recovery reducing the duration of risk for haemorrhagic complications and \nthe need for platelet transfusions. Recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim \nexperienced significantly more rapid haematological recovery, leading to a significant decrease in time \nto unsupported platelet recovery when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \nOne retrospective European study evaluating the use of G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow \ntransplantation in patients with acute leukaemias suggested an increase in the risk of GvHD, treatment \nrelated mortality (TRM) and mortality when G-CSF was administered. In a separate retrospective \ninternational study in patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, no effect on the risk of \nGvHD, TRM and mortality was seen. A meta-analysis of allogeneic transplant studies, including the \nresults of nine prospective randomized trials, 8 retrospective studies and 1 case-controlled study, did \nnot detect an effect on the risks of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD or early treatment-related mortality.  \n \n\nRelative risk (95% CI) of GvHD and TRM following treatment with G-CSF after bone marrow \n(BM) transplantation \n\nPublication  Period of \nStudy  \n\nN  Acute Grade          \nII - IV GvHD  \n\nChronic \nGvHD  \n\nTRM  \n\nMeta-Analysis  (2003)  1986 - \n2001\n\na \n \n\n1198  1.08 \n(0.87, 1.33)  \n\n1.02 \n(0.82, 1.26)  \n\n0.70 \n(0.38, 1.31)  \n\nEuropean Retrospective \nStudy (2004)  \n\n1992 - \n2002\n\nb \n \n\n1789  1.33 \n    (1.08, 1.64)  \n\n1.29 \n(1.02, 1.61)  \n\n1.73 \n(1.30, 2.32)  \n\nInternational Retrospective  \nStudy (2006)  \n\n1995 - \n2000\n\nb \n \n\n2110  1.11 \n  (0.86, 1.42)  \n\n1.10 \n(0.86, 1.39)  \n\n1.26 \n(0.95, 1.67)  \n\na\nAnalysis includes studies involving BM transplant during this period; some studies used GM-CSF  \n\nb\nAnalysis includes patients receiving BM transplant during this period  \n\n \nUse of filgrastim for the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC \ntransplantation  \nIn normal donors, a 10 micrograms/kg/day dose administered subcutaneously for 4 - 5 consecutive \ndays allows a collection of ≥ 4 x 106 \n\n \nCD34+ cells/kg recipient body weight in the majority of the \n\ndonors after two leukaphereses.  \n \nUse of filgrastim in adults with SCN (severe congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia) induces a \nsustained increase in ANCs in peripheral blood and a reduction of infection and related events.  \n \nUse of filgrastim in patients with HIV infection maintains normal neutrophil counts to allow scheduled \ndosing of antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive treatments. There is no evidence that patients with \nHIV infection treated with filgrastim show an increase in HIV replication. \n \nAs with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on \nhuman endothelial cells. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of recommended doses, serum concentrations were maintained \nabove10 ng/ml for 8 - 16 hours.  \n \nDistribution  \n \nThe volume of distribution in blood is approximately 150 ml/kg.  \n \nElimination  \n \nClearance of filgrastim has been shown to follow first-order pharmacokinetics after both subcutaneous \nor intravenous administration. The serum elimination half-life of filgrastim is approximately 3.5 hours, \nwith a clearance rate of approximately 0.6 ml/min/kg. Continuous infusion with Accofil over a period \nof up to 28 days, in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation, resulted in no \nevidence of drug accumulation and comparable half-lives.  \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \nLinearity \n \nThere is a positive linear correlation between the dose and the serum concentration of filgrastim, \nwhether administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Following subcutaneous administration of \nrecommended doses , serum concentrations were maintained above 10ng/ml for 8 to 16 hours. The \nvolume of distribution in blood is approximately 150ml/kg. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nFilgrastim was studied in repeated dose toxicity studies up to 1 year in duration which revealed \nchanges attributable to the expected pharmacological actions including increases in leukocytes, \nmyeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, extramedullary granulopoiesis and splenic enlargement. These \nchanges all reversed after discontinuation of treatment.  \nEffects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. Intravenous (80 \nµg/kg/day) administration of filgrastim to rabbits during the period of organogenesis was maternally \ntoxic and increased spontaneous abortion, post-implantation loss, and decreased mean live litter size \nand fetal weight were observed.  \nBased on reported data for another filgrastim product similar to Accofil, comparable findings plus \nincreased fetal malformations were observed at 100 µg/kg/day, a maternally toxic dose which \ncorresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately 50-90 times the exposures observed in patients \ntreated with the clinical dose of 5 µg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect level for embryo-fetal \ntoxicity in this study was 10 µg/kg/day, which corresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately \n3-5 times the exposures observed in patients treated with the clinical dose.  \nIn pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal toxicity was observed at doses up to 575 µg/kg/day. Offspring of \nrats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods, exhibited a delay in external \ndifferentiation and growth retardation (≥20 µg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 \nµg/kg/day).  \nFilgrastim had no observed effect on the fertility of male or female rats.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection or infusion  \n \nClear, colourless solution \n \n \n4. CLINCAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAccofil is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile \nneutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the \nexception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the \nduration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow \ntransplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and \nefficacy of Accofil are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.  \n \nAccofil is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). \n \nIn patients, children or adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term \nadministration of Accofil is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and \nduration of infection-related events. \n \nAccofil is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 x 109/L) \nin patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other \noptions to manage neutropenia are inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAccofil therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience in \ngranulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment and haematology and has the necessary \ndiagnostic facilities. The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nwith an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the \nmonitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed.  \n \nPosology  \n \nEstablished cytotoxic chemotherapy  \nThe recommended dose of filgrastim is 0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day). The first dose of \nAccofil should not be administered less than 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy. In \nrandomised clinical trials, a subcutaneous dose of 230 microgram/m2/day (4.0 to 8.4 \nmicrogram/kg/day) was used. \n \nDaily dosing with filgrastim should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the \nneutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Following established chemotherapy for solid \ntumours, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukaemias, it is expected that the duration of treatment required \nto fulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days. Following induction and consolidation treatment for acute \nmyeloid leukaemia the duration of treatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 days) depending on \nthe type, dose and schedule of cytotoxic chemotherapy used.  \n \nIn patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen \n1-2 days after initiation of filgrastim therapy. However, for a sustained therapeutic response, filgrastim \ntherapy should not be discontinued before the expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil count has \nrecovered to the normal range. Premature discontinuation of filgrastim therapy, prior to the time of the \nexpected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended.  \n \nIn patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation  \nThe recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 micrograms/kg/day). The first \ndose of filgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least \n24 hours after bone marrow infusion.  \n \nOnce the neutrophil nadir has been passed, the daily dose of filgrastim should be titrated against the \nneutrophil response as follows: \n \n\nNeutrophil count  Filgrastim dose adjustment  \n> 1.0 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days  Reduce to 0.5 MU (5 µg)/kg/day \nThen, if ANC remains > 1.0 x 109/L for 3 \nmore consecutive days  \n\nDiscontinue filgrastim  \n\nIf the ANC decreases to < 1.0 x 109/L during the treatment period, the dose of filgrastim should \nbe re-escalated according to the above steps  \n\nANC = absolute neutrophil count \n \nFor mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in patients undergoing \nmyelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation  \nThe recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1.0 MU (10 \nµg)/kg/day for 5-7 consecutive days. The timing of leukapheresis: 1 or 2 leukaphereses on days 5 and \n6 which is often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses may be necessary. \nFilgrastim dosing should be maintained until the last leukapheresis. \n \nThe recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is \n0.5 MU (5 µg)/kg/day given daily from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the \nexpected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. \nLeukapheresis should be performed during the period when the ANC rises from  \n< 0.5 x 109/L to > 5.0 x 109/L. For patients who have not had extensive chemotherapy, one \nleukapheresis is often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses are recommended. \n  \nFor the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation  \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nFor PBPC mobilisation in normal donors, filgrastim should be administered at 1.0 MU (10 µg)/kg/day \nfor 4 - 5 consecutive days. Leukapheresis should be started at day 5 and continued until day 6 if \nneeded in order to collect 4 x 106\n\n \nCD34+ cells/kg recipient bodyweight.  \n\n \nIn patients with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN)  \n \nCongenital neutropenia \nThe recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU (12 µg)/kg/day as a single dose or in divided doses.  \n \nIdiopathic or cyclic neutropenia \nThe recommended starting dose is 0.5 MU (5 µg)/kg/day as a single dose or in divided doses.  \n \nDose adjustments \nFilgrastim should be administered daily by subcutaneous injection until the neutrophil count has \nreached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 109/L. When the response has been obtained, the \nminimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established. Long-term daily administration is \nrequired to maintain an adequate neutrophil count. After one to two weeks of therapy, the initial dose \nmay be doubled or halved depending upon the patient's response. Subsequently, the dose may be \nindividually adjusted every 1-2 weeks to maintain the average neutrophil count between 1.5 x 109/L \nand 10 x 109/L.A faster schedule of dose escalation may be considered in patients presenting with \nsevere infections. In clinical studies, 97% of patients who responded had a complete response at doses \nof ≤ 24 µg/kg/day. The long-term safety of administration of filgrastim at doses above 24 µg/kg/day in \npatients with SCN has not been established.  \n \nIn patients with HIV infection  \n \nFor reversal of neutropenia \nThe recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 0.1 MU (1 µg )/kg/day given daily with titration up to \na maximum of 0.4 MU (4 µg )/kg/day until a normal neutrophil count is reached and can be \nmaintained (ANC > 2.0 x 109/L). In clinical studies, more than 90% of patients responded at these \ndoses, achieving a reversal of neutropenia in a median of 2 days.  \nIn a small number of patients (< 10%), doses up to 1.0 MU (10 µg) /kg/day were required to achieve \nreversal of neutropenia. \n \nFor maintenance of normal neutrophil counts \nWhen reversal of neutropenia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose to maintain a normal \nneutrophil count should be established. Initial dose adjustment to alternate day dosing with 30 MU \n(300 µg)/day is recommended. Further dose adjustment may be necessary, as determined by the \npatient's ANC, to maintain the neutrophil count at > 2.0 x 109/L. In clinical studies, dosing with 30 \nMU (300 µg )/day on 1 - 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 109/L, with the \nmedian dose frequency being 3 days per week. Long-term administration may be required to maintain \nthe ANC > 2.0 x 109/L.  \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nClinical trials with filgrastim have included a small number of elderly patients but special studies have \nnot been performed in this group and therefore specific posology recommendations cannot be made. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nStudies of filgrastim in patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function demonstrate that it \nexhibits a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals. \nDose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.  \n \nPaediatric patients in the SCN and cancer settings  \nSixty-five percent of patients studied in a SCN trial program were under 18 years of age. The efficacy \nof the treatment was clear for this age group, which included most patients with congenital \nneutropenia. There were no differences in the safety profiles for paediatric patients treated for SCN. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \nsimilar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \nThe dosage recommendations in paediatric patients are the same as those in adults receiving \nmyelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nEstablished cytotoxic chemotherapy  \nFilgrastim may be administered as a daily subcutaneous injection or alternatively as a daily \nintravenous infusion diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution over 30 minutes. For further \ninstructions on dilution prior to infusion see section 6.6. The subcutaneous route is preferred in most \ncases. There is some evidence from a study of single dose administration that intravenous dosing may \nshorten the duration of effect. The clinical relevance of this finding to multiple dose administration is \nnot clear. The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical circumstance.  \n \nPatients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation  \nFilgrastim is administered as an intravenous short-term infusion over 30 minutes or as a subcutaneous \nor intravenous continuous infusion over 24 hours, in each case after dilution in 20 ml of glucose 50 \nmg/ml (5%) solution. For further instructions on dilution with glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution prior to \ninfusion see section 6.6.  \n \nIn patients with mobilisation of PBPC  \nFilgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone: \nFilgrastim may be given as a 24 hour subcutaneous continuous infusion or subcutaneous injection. For \ninfusions filgrastim should be diluted in 20ml of 5% glucose solution (see section 6.6). \n \nFilgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy  \nFilgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n \nFilgrastim for PBPC mobilisation  in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation  \nFilgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn patients with SCN \nFor congenital, idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia, filgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn patients with HIV infection  \nFor the reversal of neutropenia and maintenance of normal neutrophil counts in patients with HIV \ninfection, filgrastim is administered subcutaneously.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs), the trade \nname of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file.  \n \nSpecial warnings and precautions across indications \n \nFilgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established \ndosage regimens. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nFilgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia who develop \nleukaemia or have evidence of leukaemic evolution. \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions ,occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \nbeen reported in patients treated with filgrastim. Permanently discontinue filgrastim in patients with \nclinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer filgrastim to patients with a history of \nhypersensitivity to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.  \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \nantibodies against filgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present. \n  \nSpecial precautions in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) \n \nMalignant cell growth \nG-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-\nmyeloid cells in vitro. \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome or Chronic myeloid leukemia \nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or \nchronic myelogenous leukaemia have not been established. Therefore, filgrastim is not indicated for \nuse in these conditions. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast \ntransformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. \n \nAcute myeloid leukaemia \nIn view of limited safety and efficacy data in patients with secondary AML, filgrastim should be \nadministered with caution. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in de novo AML \npatients aged < 55 years with good cytogenetics [t (8; 21), t (15; 17), and inv (16)] have not been \nestablished. \n \nOther special precautions \nOsteoporosis \nMonitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases \nwho undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months. \n \nPulmonary adverse effects \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF \nadministration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher \nrisk. The onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological \nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of \nAdult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Filgrastim should be discontinued and appropriate \ntreatment given in these cases. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration, \nand is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hemoconcentration. Patients \nwho develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard \nsymptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n \nGlomerulonephritis \nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nSpecial precautions in cancer patients \n \nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \nCases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported uncommonly following administration \nof filgrastim. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. Individuals receiving filgrastim who report left \nupper abdominal and/ or shoulder tip pain should be evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic \nrupture. Dose reductions of Filgrastim have been noted to slow or stop the progression of splenic \nenlargement in patients with severe chronic neutropenia, and in 3% of patients a splenectomy was \nrequired. \n \nLeukocytosis \nWhite blood cell counts of 100 x 109/L or greater have been observed in less than 5% of patients \nreceiving filgrastim at doses above 0.3 MIU/kg/day (3 µg/kg/day). No undesirable effects directly \nattributable to this degree of leukocytosis have been reported. However, in view of the potential risks \nassociated with severe leukocytosis, a white blood cell count should be performed at regular intervals \nduring filgrastim therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/L after the expected nadir, filgrastim \nshould be discontinued immediately. However, during the period of administration of filgrastim for \nPBPC mobilisation, filgrastim should be discontinued or its dosage should be reduced if the leukocyte \ncounts rise to > 70 x 109/L. \n \nRisks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy \nSpecial caution should be used when treating patients with high dose chemotherapy because improved \ntumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic agents may \nlead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic and dermatologic effects (please \nrefer to the prescribing information of the specific chemotherapy agents used). \n \nEffect of chemotherapy on erythrocytes and thrombocytes \nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy. Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy \n(e.g. full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should \nbe taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to \ncause severe thrombocytopenia. \n \nThe use of filgrastim-mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of \nthrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy. \n \nOther special precautions \nThe effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been \nstudied. Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil \ncounts. Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors, neutrophil response may be diminished (such \nas those treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration \nby tumour). \n \nVascular disorders, including veno-occlusive disease and fluid volume disturbances, have been \nreported occasionally in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation. \nThere have been reports of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF \nafter allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient abnormal bone scans. This should be considered when interpreting bone-\nimaging results. \n \nSpecial precautions in patients undergoing PBPC mobilization \n \nMobilization of PBPC \nThere are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n(filgrastim alone, or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient \npopulation. The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of \nCD34+ cells mean that direct comparison between different studies is difficult. It is therefore difficult \nto recommend an optimal method. The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in relation \nto the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient.  \n \nPrior exposure to cytotoxic agents \nPatients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy may not show sufficient \nmobilisation of PBPC to achieve the recommended minimum yield (2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) or \nacceleration of platelet recovery to the same degree. \n \nSome cytotoxic agents exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool and may \nadversely affect progenitor mobilisation. Agents such as melphalan, carmustine (BCNU) and \ncarboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor mobilisation, \nmay reduce progenitor yield. However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or carmustine \n(BCNU) together with filgrastim has been shown to be effective for progenitor mobilisation. When \nperipheral blood progenitor cell transplantation is envisaged it is advisable to plan the stem cell \nmobilization procedure early in the treatment course of the patient. Particular attention should be paid \nto the number of progenitors mobilised in such patients before the administration of high-dose \nchemotherapy. If yields are inadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms of \ntreatment not requiring progenitor support should be considered. \n \nAssessment of progenitor cell yields \nIn assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular \nattention should be paid to the method of quantitation. The results of flow cytometric analysis of \nCD34+ cell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and therefore, recommendations \nof numbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution. \n \nStatistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34+ cells re-infused and the rate of \nplatelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship. \n \nThe recommendation of a minimum yield of ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg is based on published \nexperience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution. Yields in excess of this minimum yield \nappear to correlate with more rapid recovery; those below with slower recovery. \n \nSpecial precautions in normal donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization \n \nMobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be \nconsidered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. \n \nPBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory \neligibility criteria for stem cell donation. Particular attention should be paid to haematological values \nand infectious diseases. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim has not been assessed in normal donors \nless than 16 years or greater than 60 years of age.  \n \nThrombocytopenia \nThrombocytopenia has been reported very commonly in patients receiving filgrastim .Platelet counts \nshould therefore be monitored closely.  \n \nTransient thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 109/L) following filgrastim administration and \nleukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied. Among these, two cases of platelets < 50 x \n109/L were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure. If more than one leukapheresis is \nrequired, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets < 100 x 109/L prior to \nleukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets are < 75 x 109/L.  \n \nLeukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects \nin haemostasis. Filgrastim administration should be discontinued or its dosage should be reduced if the \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nleukocyte counts rise to > 70 x 109/L. Donors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be \nmonitored until haematological indices return to normal.  \n \nTransient cytogenetic abnormalities have been observed in normal donors following G-CSF use. The \nsignificance of these changes is unknown. Nevertheless, a risk of promotion of a malignant myeloid \nclone cannot be excluded. It is recommended that the apheresis centre perform a systematic record and \ntracking of the stem cell donors for at least 10 years to ensure monitoring of long-term safety. \n \nCommon but generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and uncommon cases of splenic rupture \nhave been reported in healthy donors and patients following administration of G-CSFs. Some cases of \nsplenic rupture were fatal. Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical \nexamination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in donors and/or \npatients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain.  \n \nIn normal donors, dyspnoea has been reported commonly and other pulmonary adverse events \n(haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhage, lung infiltrates, and hypoxia) have been reported \nuncommonly. In case of suspected or confirmed pulmonary adverse events, discontinuation of \ntreatment with filgrastim should be considered and appropriate medical care given.  \n \nSpecial precautions in recipients of allogeneic PBPC mobilised with filgrastim \n \nCurrent data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the \nrecipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with \nbone marrow transplantation. \n \nSpecial precautions in SCN patients \n \nBlood cell counts \nThrombocytopenia has been reported commonly in patients receiving filgrastim. Platelet counts should \nbe monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Consideration should \nbe given to intermittent cessation or decreasing the dose of filgrastim in patients who develop \nthrombocytopenia, i.e. platelets consistently < 100,000/mm3. \nOther blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, \nwhich require close monitoring of cell counts. \n \nTransformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome \nSpecial care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic \ndisorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia and myeloid leukaemia. Complete blood cell \ncounts with differential and platelet counts and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and \nkaryotype should be performed prior to treatment. \nThere was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in \nclinical trial patients with SCN treated with filgrastim. This observation has only been made in \npatients with congenital neutropenia. MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease \nand are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy. A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had \nnormal cytogenetic evaluations at baseline was subsequently found to have abnormalities, including \nmonosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation. If patients with SCN develop abnormal cytogenetics, the \nrisks and benefits of continuing filgrastim should be carefully weighed; filgrastim should be \ndiscontinued if MDS or leukaemia occurs. It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of \npatients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic \ntransformation. It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow \nexaminations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months). \n \nOther special precautions \nCauses of transient neutropenia such as viral infections should be excluded. \n \nCases of splenomegaly have been reported very commonly and cases of splenic rupture have been \nreported commonly following administration of filgrastim. Individuals receiving filgrastim who report \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nleft upper abdominal and/ or shoulder tip pain should be evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic \nrupture. \n \nSplenomegaly   is a direct effect of treatment with filgrastim. Thirty-one percent (31%) of patients in \nstudies were documented as having palpable splenomegaly. Increases in volume, measured \nradiographically occurred early during filgrastim therapy and tended to plateau later in treatment. Dose \nreductions were noted to slow or stop the progression of splenic enlargement and in 3% of patients a \nsplenectomy was required. Spleen size should be evaluated regularly. Abdominal palpation should be \nsufficient to detect abnormal increases in splenic volume. \n \nHaematuria was common and proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients. Regular urinalysis \nshould be performed to monitor this event. \n \nThe safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been \nestablished. \n \nSpecial precautions in patients with HIV infection \nCases of splenomegaly have been reported  commonly following administration of filgrastim. \nIndividuals receiving filgrastim who report left upper abdominal and/ or shoulder tip pain should be \nevaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. \n \nBlood cell counts \nANC should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Some \npatients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in neutrophil count to the initial \ndose of filgrastim. It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for the first 2 to 3 days of \nfilgrastim administration. Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is measured at least twice \nweekly for the first two weeks and subsequently once per week or once every other week during \nmaintenance therapy. During intermittent dosing with 30 MU (300 microgram)/day of filgrastim, there \ncan be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time. In order to determine a patient's trough or \nnadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement immediately prior \nto any scheduled dosing with filgrastim. \n \nRisk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medicinal products \nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \nmyelosuppressive medicinal products. As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater \nnumber of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of \ndeveloping thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see \nabove). \n \nInfections and malignancies causing myelosuppression \nNeutropenia may be due to bone marrow infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium \navium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma. In patients with known bone marrow-infiltrating \ninfections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition in \naddition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia. The effects of filgrastim on \nneutropenia due to bone marrow-infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established. \n \nSpecial precautions in sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease \n \nSickle cells crises, in some cases fatal, have been reported with the use of filgrastim in subjects with \nsickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of \nfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease and only after careful evaluation of the \npotential risks and benefits. \n \nAll patients \n \nAccofil contains sorbitol (E420) as an excipient at a concentration of 50 mg/ml. Patients with rare \nhereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not use this medicinal product. \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \nmarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic \nchemotherapy have not been definitively established. In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing \nmyeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended \nin the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence from a small \nnumber of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5-Fluorouracil indicates that the severity \nof neutropenia may be exacerbated. \n \nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been \ninvestigated in clinical trials. \n \nSince lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, it is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim. \nAlthough this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an \ninteraction is harmful. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity. An increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed in rabbits at \nhigh multiples of the clinical exposure and in the presence of maternal toxicity (see section 5.3). There \nare reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women has been \ndemonstrated. \nFilgrastim is not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether filgrastim or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-\nfeeding child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from filgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \nand the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nFilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAccofil may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nDizziness may occur following the administration of Accofil (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during Filgrastim treatment include: anaphylactic \nreaction, serious pulmonary adverse events (including interstitial pneumonia and ARDS), capillary \nleak syndrome, severe splenomegaly/splenic rupture, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome or \nleukaemia in SCN patients, GvHD in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transfer or peripheral \nblood cell progenitor cell transplant and sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. \n\n  \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain (which includes \nbone pain, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal \nchest pain, neck pain), anaemia, vomiting, and nausea. In clinical trials in cancer patients \nmusculoskeletal pain was mild or moderate in 10%, and severe in 3% of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe data in the tables below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical trials and spontaneous \nreporting.

These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant \ndiseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medications or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). \n \nIn randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies, filgrastim did not increase the incidence of \nundesirable effects associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. In those clinical trials, undesirable effects \nreported with equal frequency in cancer patients treated with filgrastim/chemotherapy and \nplacebo/chemotherapy included nausea and vomiting, alopecia, diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia, mucositis, \nheadache, cough, skin rash, chest pain, generalised weakness, sore throat, constipation and pain. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim. \nThe mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving filgrastim is unknown. The frequency is estimated \nas uncommon from clinical trial data.  \n \nSweets syndrome \nCases of Sweets syndrome (acute febrile dermatosis) have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \nThe frequency is estimated as uncommon from clinical trial data.  \n \nPulmonary adverse events \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nIn clinical studies and the post-marketing setting pulmonary adverse effects including interstitial lung \ndisease, pulmonary oedema, and lung infiltration have been reported in some cases with an outcome of \nrespiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see section 4.4)  \n \nSplenomegaly and Splenic rupture \nCases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported following administration of filgrastim. \nSome cases of splenic rupture were fatal (see section 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity-type reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea and \nhypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment in clinical studies and in post-marketing \nexperience. Overall, reports were more common after intravenous administration. In some cases, \nsymptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. Filgrastim should be \npermanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.  \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, isolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with \nsickle cell disease (see section 4.4). The frequency is estimated as uncommon from clinical trial data. \n \nCutaneous vasculitis \nCutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with Filgrastim. The mechanism of \nvasculitis in patients receiving Filgrastim is unknown. During long term use cutaneous vasculitis has \nbeen reported in 2% of SCN patients. \n \nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) \nPseudogout has been reported in cancer patients treated with filgrastim, and the frequency is estimated \nas uncommon from clinical trial data. \n \nLeukocytosis \nLeukocytosis (WBC > 50 x 109/L) was observed in 41% of donors and transient thrombocytopenia \n(platelets < 100 x 109/L) following filgrastim treatment and leukapheresis was observed in 35% of \ndonors.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \nsimilar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy suggesting no age-related \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. The only consistently reported adverse event was \nmusculoskeletal pain which is no different from the experience in the adult population. There is \ninsufficient data to further evaluate filgrastim use in paediatric subjects. \n \nOther special populations  \n \nGeriatric Use \nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects over 65 years of age \ncompared to younger adult (>18 years of age) subjects receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and clinical \nexperience has not identified differences in the responses between elderly and younger adult patients. \nThere are insufficient data to evaluate Accofil use in geriatric subjects for other approved Accofil \nindications.  \n \nPaediatric SCN patients \nCases of decreased bone density and osteoporosis have been reported in paediatric patients with severe \nchronic neutropenia receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim.  \n  \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of Accofil overdose have not been established. Discontinuation of filgrastim therapy \nusually results in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days, with a return to normal \nlevels in 1 to 7 days. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors, ATC code: L03AA02 \nAccofil is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nHuman G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils \nfrom the bone marrow. Accofil containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in \nperipheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some SCN \npatients, filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and \nbasophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia \nalready prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses. \nNeutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by \ntests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating \nneutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.  \n \nUse of filgrastim in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to significant reductions in the \nincidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Treatment with filgrastim \nsignificantly reduces the duration of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospitalisation after \ninduction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myeloablative therapy followed by bone \nmarrow transplantation. The incidence of fever and documented infections were not reduced in either \nsetting. The duration of fever was not reduced in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed \nby bone marrow transplantation.  \n \nUse of filgrastim, either alone, or after chemotherapy, mobilises haematopoietic progenitor cells into \nperipheral blood. These autologous PBPCs may be harvested and infused after high-dose cytotoxic \ntherapy, either in place of, or in addition to bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of PBPCs \naccelerates haematopoietic recovery reducing the duration of risk for haemorrhagic complications and \nthe need for platelet transfusions. Recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim \nexperienced significantly more rapid haematological recovery, leading to a significant decrease in time \nto unsupported platelet recovery when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.  \n \nOne retrospective European study evaluating the use of G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow \ntransplantation in patients with acute leukaemias suggested an increase in the risk of GvHD, treatment \nrelated mortality (TRM) and mortality when G-CSF was administered. In a separate retrospective \ninternational study in patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, no effect on the risk of \nGvHD, TRM and mortality was seen. A meta-analysis of allogeneic transplant studies, including the \nresults of nine prospective randomized trials, 8 retrospective studies and 1 case-controlled study, did \nnot detect an effect on the risks of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD or early treatment-related mortality.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n36 \n \n\nRelative risk (95% CI) of GvHD and TRM following treatment with G-CSF after bone marrow \n(BM) transplantation \n\nPublication  Period of \nStudy  \n\nN  Acute Grade          \nII - IV GvHD  \n\nChronic \nGvHD  \n\nTRM  \n\nMeta-Analysis   \n(2003)  \n\n1986 - \n2001\n\na \n \n\n1198  1.08 \n(0.87, 1.33)  \n\n1.02 \n(0.82, 1.26)  \n\n0.70 \n(0.38, 1.31)  \n\nEuropean Retrospective  \nStudy (2004)  \n\n1992 - \n2002\n\nb \n \n\n1789  1.33 \n    (1.08, 1.64)  \n\n1.29 \n(1.02, 1.61)  \n\n1.73 \n(1.30, 2.32)  \n\nInternational \nRetrospective  \nStudy (2006)  \n\n1995 - \n2000\n\nb \n \n\n2110  1.11 \n  (0.86, 1.42)  \n\n1.10 \n(0.86, 1.39)  \n\n1.26 \n(0.95, 1.67)  \n\na\nAnalysis includes studies involving BM transplant during this period; some studies used GM-CSF  \n\nb\nAnalysis includes patients receiving BM transplant during this period  \n\n \nUse of filgrastim for the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC \ntransplantation  \n \nIn normal donors, a 10 micrograms/kg/day dose administered subcutaneously for 4 - 5 consecutive \ndays allows a collection of ≥ 4 x 106 \n\n \nCD34+ cells/kg recipient body weight in the majority of the \n\ndonors after two leukaphereses.  \n \nUse of filgrastim in adults with SCN (severe congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia) induces a \nsustained increase in ANCs in peripheral blood and a reduction of infection and related events.  \n \nUse of filgrastim in patients with HIV infection maintains normal neutrophil counts to allow scheduled \ndosing of antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive treatments. There is no evidence that patients with \nHIV infection treated with filgrastim show an increase in HIV replication. \n \nAs with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on \nhuman endothelial cells. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of recommended doses, serum concentrations were maintained \nabove10 ng/ml for 8 - 16 hours.  \n \nDistribution  \n \nThe volume of distribution in blood is approximately 150 ml/kg.  \n \nElimination  \n \nClearance of filgrastim has been shown to follow first-order pharmacokinetics after both subcutaneous \nor intravenous administration. The serum elimination half-life of filgrastim is approximately 3.5 hours, \nwith a clearance rate of approximately 0.6 ml/min/kg. Continuous infusion with Accofil over a period \nof up to 28 days, in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation, resulted in no \nevidence of drug accumulation and comparable half-lives.  \n \nLinearity \n \nThere is a positive linear correlation between the dose and the serum concentration of filgrastim, \nwhether administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Following subcutaneous administration of \nrecommended doses , serum concentrations were maintained above 10ng/ml for 8 to 16 hours. The \nvolume of distribution in blood is approximately 150ml/kg. \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nFilgrastim was studied in repeated dose toxicity studies up to 1 year in duration which revealed \nchanges attributable to the expected pharmacological actions including increases in leukocytes, \nmyeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, extramedullary granulopoiesis and splenic enlargement. These \nchanges all reversed after discontinuation of treatment. \nEffects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. Intravenous (80 \nµg/kg/day) administration of filgrastim to rabbits during the period of organogenesis was maternally \ntoxic and increased spontaneous abortion, post-implantation loss, and decreased mean live litter size \nand fetal weight were observed. \nBased on reported data for another filgrastim product similar to Accofil, comparable findings plus \nincreased fetal malformations were observed at 100 µg/kg/day, a maternally toxic dose which \ncorresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately 50-90 times the exposures observed in patients \ntreated with the clinical dose of 5 µg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect level for embryo-fetal \ntoxicity in this study was 10 µg/kg/day, which corresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately \n3-5 times the exposures observed in patients treated with the clinical dose. \nIn pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal toxicity was observed at doses up to 575 µg/kg/day. Offspring of \nrats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods, exhibited a delay in external \ndifferentiation and growth retardation (≥20 µg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 \nµg/kg/day). \nFilgrastim had no observed effect on the fertility of male or female rats. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nAcetic acid glacial \nSodium hydroxide \nSorbitol (E420)  \nPolysorbate 80 \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nAccofil must not be diluted with sodium chloride solutions.  \n \nDiluted filgrastim may be adsorbed to glass and plastic materials. \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6.  \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n3 years. \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted solution for infusion has been demonstrated for \n24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used \nimmediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless \ndilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C). Do not freeze.  \n \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nAccidental one-time exposure to freezing temperatures does not adversely affect the stability of Accofil. \nIf exposure has been greater than 24 hours or frozen more than once then Accofil should NOT be \nused. \n \nWithin its shelf-life and for the purpose of ambulatory use, the patient may remove the product from \nthe refrigerator and store it at room temperature (not above 25°C) for one single period of up to 15 \ndays. At the end of this period, the product should not be put back in the refrigerator and should be \ndisposed of. \n \nKeep the syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nType I glass pre-filled syringe with a permanently attached stainless steel needle in the tip and 1/40 \nprinted markings for graduations from 0.1 mL to 1 mL on the barrel. The needle cover of the pre-filled \nsyringe contains dry natural rubber (see section 4.4). Each pre-filled syringe contains 0.5 ml solution. \n \nEach pack contains one, three, five, seven or ten pre-filled syringes, with or without a needle safety \nguard, and alcohol swabs. The packs without blister are for syringes without needle safety guard. The \nblister packs are for individual syringes with prefixed needle safety guard. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nIf required, Accofil may be diluted in 5% glucose. Dilution to a final concentration less than 0.2 MU \n(2 µg) per ml is not recommended at any time. \n \nThe solution should be visually inspected prior to use. Only clear solutions without particles should be \nused. Do not shake.  \n \nFor patients treated with filgrastim diluted to concentrations below 1.5 MU (15 µg) per ml, human \nserum albumin (HSA) should be added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Example: In a final \ninjection volume of 20 ml, total doses of filgrastim less than 30 MU (300 µg) should be given with 0.2 \nml of 200 mg/ml (20%) human albumin solution added. \n \nAccofil contains no preservative. In view of the possible risk of microbial contamination, Accofil  \npre-filled syringes are for single use only. \n \nWhen diluted in 5% glucose, Accofil is compatible with glass and a variety of plastics including PVC, \npolyolefin (a co-polymer of polypropylene and polyethylene) and polypropylene. \n \nUsing the pre-filled syringe with a needle safety guard  \n \nThe needle safety guard covers the needle after injection to prevent needle stick injury. This does not \naffect normal operation of the syringe. Depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose has \nbeen given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. While maintaining pressure on the \nplunger, remove the syringe from the patient. The needle safety guard will cover the needle when \nreleasing the plunger.  \n \nUsing the pre-filled syringe without a needle safety guard  \n \nAdminister the dose as per standard protocol. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nDisposal  \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

What you need to know before you use Accofil \n3. How to use Accofil \n4. Possible side effects \n5.      How to store Accofil \n6.      Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Accofil is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Accofil is \n \nAccofil contains the active ingredient filgrastim. Filgrastim is a protein produced in bacteria called \nEscherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines \nand is very similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) produced by \nyour own body. Filgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new blood cells are made) to \nproduce more white blood cells that help fight infection.  \n \nWhat Accofil is used for \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Accofil for you to help your body make more white blood cells. Your \ndoctor will tell you why you are being treated with Accofil. Accofil is useful in several different \nconditions which are: \n \n-  chemotherapy  \n-  bone marrow transplantation \n-  severe chronic neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) \n-  neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) in patients with HIV infection  \n- peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation (to stimulate stem cells to enter the blood stream to be \ncollected and used in bone marrow transplantation). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Accofil \n \nDo not use Accofil \n \n- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to filgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Accofil: \n \nPlease tell your doctor before starting treatment if you have: \n• Sickle cell anaemia, accofil may cause sickle cell crisis. \n• Osteoporosis (bone disease)  \n \nPlease tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Accofil, if you: \n• Get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left shoulder \n(these may be symptoms of enlarge spleen (splenomegaly) or possibly rupture of spleen). \n \n• Notice unusual bleeding or bruising that may be (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood \nplatelets (thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot. \n \n• Have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives of skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue \nor other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these could be a signs \nof severe allergic reaction.   \n\n \n• Experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you \nnotice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis). \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex) which may \ncause an allergic reaction. \n \nInflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) \nhas been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, \nabdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you \nexperience these symptoms. \n \nLoss of response to filgrastim \nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your \ndoctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which \nneutralise filgrastim’s activity \nYour doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet. \nIf you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the \nblood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)) You should talk to your doctor about your risks \nof developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to \ndevelop cancers of the blood, you should not use Accofil, unless instructed by your doctor. \nIf you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between16 and 60 years. \n \nTake special care with other products that stimulate white blood cells \nAccofil is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of white blood cells. Your \nhealthcare professional should always record the exact product you are using. \n \nOther medicines and Accofil \n \nYou should not receive Accofil in the 24 hours before and the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy. \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAccofil has not been tested in pregnant women. \n \nIt is important to tell your doctor if you:  \n\n• are pregnant or breast-feeding; \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n• think you may be pregnant; or \n• are planning to have a baby. \n\n \nIt is unknown whether filgrastim passes over into the breast milk. Therefore, your doctor may decide \nthat you should not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAccofil may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. This medicine may \ncause dizziness. It is advisable to wait and see how you feel after taking Accofil and before driving or \noperating machinery. \n \nAccofil contains sorbitol and sodium \n \nThis medicine contains sorbitol. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to \nsome sugars (fructose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine.  \n \nThis medicine also contains sodium less than 1mmol sodium (0.035 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’.  \n \n \n3. How to use Accofil \n \nAlways use Accofil exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe amount of Accofil you need will depend on the condition you are taking Accofil for and on your \nbodyweight. \n \nDosage \n \nAccofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) associated with chemotherapy  \n \nThe usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day. For example, \nif you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 30 million units (300 micrograms). Your treatment \nwith Accofil will usually last for about 14 days. In some disease types, however, longer treatment \nlasting up to about one month may be required. \n \nAccofil and bone marrow transplantation  \n \nThe usual starting dose is 1 million units (10 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day given \nas an infusion. For example, if you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 60 million units (600 \nmicrograms). You will normally receive your first dose of Accofil at least 24 hours after your \nchemotherapy and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. Your doctor may \nthen test your blood to see how well the treatment is working and how long it should last. \n \nAccofil and severe chronic neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells)  \n \nThe usual starting dose is between 0.5 million units  (5 micrograms) and 1.2 million units (12 \nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day in a single or divided dose. Your doctor may then test \nyour blood to see how well your treatment with Accofil is working and to find the dose that is best for \nyou. Long-term treatment with Accofil is required for reduction in neutropenia. \n \nAccofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) in patients with HIV infection  \n \nThe usual starting dose is between 0.1 million units (1 micrograms) and 0.4 million units (4 \nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Your doctor may test your blood at regular intervals \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nto see how well the Accofil treatment is working. Once the number of white cells in your blood has \nreturned to normal it may be possible to reduce the dose frequency to less than once per day. Long \nterm treatment with Accofil may be required to maintain a normal number of white cells in your \nblood.  \n \nAccofil and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (stem cells collected from the blood to use in \nbone marrow transplantation) \n \nIf you are donating stem cells for yourself, the usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) to 1 \nmillion units (10 micrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Accofil treatment will last for up to \n2 weeks. Your doctor will monitor your blood to determine the best time to collect the stem cells.  \nIf you are acting as a stem cell donor for another person, the usual dose is 1 million units (10 \nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Accofil treatment will last for 4 to 5 days. Your \ndoctor will perform regular blood tests to determine the best time to collect the stem cells. \n \nHow Accofil is given \n \nThis medicine is given by injection, either through an intravenous (IV) infusion (drip) or by a \nsubcutaneous (SC) injection into the tissue just under the skin.  \n \nIf you are receiving this medicine by subcutaneous injection, your doctor may suggest that you learn \nhow to give yourself the injections. Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do this \n(see information below on instructions for injecting Accofil). Do not attempt to self-administer \nwithout this training. Some of the information you require is given at the end of this leaflet, but proper \ntreatment of your disease requires close and constant co-operation with your doctor. \n \nInformation for injecting yourself  \nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Accofil. It is important that \nyou do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor \nor nurse. If you are not sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any questions, please ask \nyour doctor or nurse for help. \n \nHow do I inject Accofil myself?  \nYou will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a \nsubcutaneous injection. You will need to have your injections at about the same time every day. \n \nEquipment that you need  \nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  \n• a pre-filled syringe of Accofil; \n• alcohol swab or similar. \n \nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Accofil?  \nEnsure the needle cover remains on the syringe until just before you are ready to inject. \na. Take your Accofil pre-filled syringe out of the refrigerator.  \nb. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed \nthe last day of the month shown or if it has been kept outside of the refrigerator for more than 15 days \nor has otherwise expired.  \nc. Check the appearance of Accofil. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles in \nit, you must not use it.  \nd. For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room \ntemperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. Do not warm Accofil \nin any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).  \ne. Wash your hands thoroughly.  \nf. Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach them (the \nAccofil pre-filled syringe and alcohol swab). \n \nHow do I prepare my Accofil injection?  \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nBefore you inject Accofil you must do the following:  \n1. Hold the syringe and gently take the cover from the needle without twisting. Pull straight as \nshown in pictures 1 and 2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger. \n \n\n1 \n\n \n  \n\n2 \n\n \n \n2. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. . You do not have to remove the air \nbubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless. \n3. The syringe may contain more liquid than you need. Use the scale on the syringe barrel as \nfollows to set the correct dose of Accofil that your doctor prescribed. Eject unnecessary liquid by \npushing the plunger up to the number (mL) on the syringe that matches the prescribed dose.  \n4. Check again to make sure the correct dose of Accofil is in the syringe.  \n5. You can now use the pre-filled syringe. \n \nWhere should I give my injection?  \nThe most suitable places to inject yourself are:  \n• the top of your thighs; and  \n• the abdomen, except for the area around the navel (see picture 3). \n \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n3 \n\n \n \nIf someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your arms (see picture 4) \n \n\n4 \n\n \n  \nIt is better to change the injection site every day to avoid the risk of soreness at any one site.  \n \nHow do I give my injection?  \na. Disinfect the injection site by using an alcohol swab and pinch the skin between your thumb and \nforefinger, without squeezing it (see picture 5).  \n \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n5 \n\n \n \nPre-filled syringe without needle safety guard \n \nb. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor (see picture 6).  \nc. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood \nin the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place.  \nd. Always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose \nhas been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. Do not release the pressure on the \nplunger! \ne. Inject only the dose your doctor has told you. \nf. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle while maintaining pressure on the plunger and then let \ngo of your skin. \ng. Put the used syringe in the disposal container. Use each syringe only for one injection. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n \nPre-filled syringe with needle safety guard \n \nh. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor (see picture 7).  \ni. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood in \nthe syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place.  \nj. Inject only the dose your doctor has told you following the instructions below. \nk. Always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly while grasping the \nfinger flange until the entire dose has been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. Do \nnot release the pressure on the plunger!  \nl. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle while keeping the syringe at the same angle and \nmaintaining pressure on the plunger, then let go of your skin. The protective sleeve will automatically \ncover the needle and an audible “click” will be heard to confirm shield activation (see picture 8). The \nneedle guard will not activate unless the entire dose has been given. \n \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \nRemember  \nIf you have any problems, please do not be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice.  \n \nDisposing of used syringes  \n• The needle safety guard prevents needle stick injuries after use, so no special precautions for \ndisposal are required. Dispose of the syringe as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nIf you use more Accofil than you should \n \nIf you use more Accofil than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to use Accofil \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten injection. Contact your doctor to discuss when \nyou should inject the next dose. \n \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nIf you stop using Accofil \n \nYour doctor will tell you when to stop using Accofil. It is quite normal to have a number of courses of \ntreatment with Accofil.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately during treatment: \n \n• if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the face, lips, \nmouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). Hypersensitivity is common \nin patients with cancer; \n• if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of Acute \nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is uncommon in patients with cancer;  \n• if you get left upper belly (abdonimal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your \nshoulder since this may relate to a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen \n(splenomegaly) or rupture of the spleen)..  \n• if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine \n(haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if protein \nis found in your urine (proteinuria). \n• If you have any of the following or a combination of the following side effects: swelling or \npuffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal \nswelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These symptoms generally develop \nin a rapid fashion.  \n \nThese could be symptoms of an uncommon condition (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) called \nCapillary Leak Syndrome which causes the blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body \nand needs urgent medical attention.  \n \n• If you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: \n  - fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, \nshortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin. \n \nThese could be symptoms of a condition called “sepsis” (also called \"blood poisoning\"), a \nsevere infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and \nneeds urgent medical attention. \n \nif you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients who \nreceived Accofil. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood \nin your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual \n \nA very frequent side effect of Accofil use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), \nwhich can be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a \nstem cell or bone marrow transplant, Graft versus host disease (GvHD) may occur- this is a reaction of \nthe donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the \npalms of your hands and soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your \neyes, lungs, vagina and joints. Very commonly seen in normal stem cells donors is increase in white \nblood cells (leukocytosis) and decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot \n(thrombocytopenia), these will be monitored by your doctor. \n \n \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \nVery common side effects (seen in more than 1 in 10 people who take Accofil): \n• vomiting \n• nausea \n• unusual hair loss or thinning (alopecia) \n• tiredness (fatigue) \n• soreness and swelling of the digestive tract lining which runs from the mouth to the anus (mucosal \ninflammation) \n• decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot (thrombocytopenia) \n• low red blood cell count (anaemia) \n• fever (pyrexia) \n• headache \n• diarrhoea \n \nCommon side effects (seen in more than 1 in 100 people taking Accofil):  \n• inflammation of the lung (bronchitis) \n• upper respiratory tract infection \n•  urinary tract infection \n•  decreased appetite \n•  trouble sleeping (insomnia) \n•  dizziness \n•  decreased feeling of sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoaesthesia) \n•  tingling or numbness of the hands or feet (paraesthesia) \n•  low blood pressure (hypotension) \n•  high blood pressure (hypertension) \n•  cough \n•  coughing up blood (haemoptysis) \n•  pain in your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal pain) \n•  nose bleeds (epistaxis) \n•  constipation \n•  oral pain \n•  enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) \n•  rash \n•  redness of the skin (erythema) \n•  muscle spasm \n•  pain when passing urine (dysuria) \n•  chest pain \n•  pain \n•  generalised weakness (asthenia) \n•  generally feeling unwell (malaise) \n•  swelling in the hands and feet (oedema peripheral) \n•  increase of certain enzymes in the blood \n•  changes in blood chemistry \n•  transfusion reaction \n \nUncommon side effects (seen in more than 1 in 1000 people taking Accofil):  \n• increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) \n•  allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) \n•  rejection of transplanted bone marrow (graft versus host disease) \n•  high uric acid levels in the blood, which may cause gout (hyperuricaemia) (Blood uric acid \n\nincreased) \n•  liver damage caused by blocking of the small veins within the liver (veno-occlusive disease) \n•  lungs do not function as they should, causing breathlessness (respiratory failure) \n•  swelling and/or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n•  inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) \n•  abnormal x-rays of the lungs (lung infiltration) \n•  bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage) \n•  lack of absorption of oxygen in the lung (hypoxia) \n•  bumpy skin rash (rash macuo-papular) \n•  disease which causes bones to become less dense, making them weaker, more brittle and likely \n\nto break (osteoporosis) \n•  injection site reaction \n \nRare side effects (seen in more than 1 in 10,000 people taking Accofil): \n• Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the \nheart to the body), see section 2. \n• severe pain in the bones, chest, gut or joints (sickle cell anaemia with crisis) \n•  sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) \n•  pain and swelling of the joints, similar to gout (pseudogout) \n•  a change in how your body regulates fluids within your body and may result in puffiness (fluid \n\nvolume disturbances) \n•  inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous vasculitis) \n•  plum-coloured, raised, painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with a fever \n\n(Sweets syndrome) \n•  worsening of rheumatoid arthritis \n•  unusual change in the urine \n•  bone density decreased \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. \n \nReporting of side effects  \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.  \n \n \n5. How to store Accofil \n \nKeep out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the outer carton and on the pre-filled \nsyringe after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of the month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. \n \nThe syringe can be removed from the refrigerator and left at room temperature (not above 25°C) for a \nsingle period, that ends within the labelled expiry date, of up to a maximum of 15 days.

In view of the possible risk of microbial contamination, \nAccofil syringes are for single use only. \n \nAccidental exposure to freezing temperatures for up to 24 hours does not affect the stability of \nAccofil. If exposure has been greater than 24 hours or frozen more than once then Accofil should NOT \nbe used. \n \nIn order to improve traceability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, the product name (Accofil) \nand batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file \n \nAccofil should not be diluted with sodium chloride solution. This medicinal product must not be \nmixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned below. Diluted filgrastim may be \nadsorbed to glass and plastic materials except diluted, as mentioned below. \n \nIf required, Accofil may be diluted in 5% glucose. Dilution to a final concentration less than 0.2 MU \n(2 µg) per ml is not recommended at any time. \n \nThe solution should be visually inspected prior to use. Only clear solutions without particles should be \nused.  \n \nFor patients treated with filgrastim diluted to concentrations below 1.5 MU (15 µg) per ml, human \nserum albumin (HSA) should be added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Example: In a final \ninjection volume of 20 ml, total doses of filgrastim less than 30 MU (300 µg) should be given with 0.2 \nml of 200 mg/ml (20%) human albumin solution added. \n \nWhen diluted in 5% glucose, Accofil is compatible with glass and a variety of plastics including PVC, \npolyolefin (a co-polymer of polypropylene and polyethylene) and polypropylene. \n \nAfter dilution  \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted solution for infusion has been demonstrated for \n24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used \nimmediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless \ndilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nUsing the pre-filled syringe with a needle safety guard  \n \nThe needle safety guard covers the needle after injection to prevent needle stick injury. This does not \naffect normal operation of the syringe. Depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose has \nbeen given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. While maintaining pressure on the \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\nplunger, remove the syringe from the patient. The needle safety guard will cover the needle when \nreleasing the plunger.  \n \nUsing the pre-filled syringe without a needle safety guard \n \nAdminister the dose as per standard protocol. \n \nDisposal  \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nAccofil 48 MU/0.5 ml (0.96 mg/ml) solution for injection or infusion in pre-filled syringe \nfilgrastim \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \nif their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nIn this leaflet \n \n1. What Accofil is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Accofil \n3. How to use Accofil \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Accofil \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Accofil is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Accofil is \n \nAccofil contains the active ingredient filgrastim. Filgrastim is a protein produced in bacteria called \nEscherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines \nand is very similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) produced by \nyour own body. Filgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new blood cells are made) to \nproduce more white blood cells that help fight infection.  \n \nWhat Accofil is used for \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Accofil for you to help your body make more white blood cells. Your \ndoctor will tell you why you are being treated with Accofil. Accofil is useful in several different \nconditions which are: \n \n-  chemotherapy  \n-  bone marrow transplantation \n-  severe chronic neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) \n-  neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) in patients with HIV infection  \n- peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation (to stimulate stem cells to enter the blood stream to be \ncollected and used in bone marrow transplantation). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Accofil \n \nDo not use Accofil \n \n- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to filgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n \n \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Accofil: \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Accofil: \n \nPlease tell your doctor before starting treatment if you have: \n• Sickle cell anaemia, accofil may cause sickle cell crisis. \n• Osteoporosis (bone disease)  \n \nPlease tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Accofil, if you: \n• Get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left shoulder( \nthese may be symptoms of enlarge spleen (splenomegaly) or possibly rupture of spleen). \n \n• Notice unusual bleeding or bruising that may be (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood \nplatelets (thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot). \n \n• Have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives of skin, swelling of the face, lips,tongue \nor other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these could be a signs \nof severe allergic reaction.   \n \n• Experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you \n\nnotice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis). \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex) which may \ncause an allergic reaction. \n \nInflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) \nhas been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, \nabdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you \nexperience these symptoms. \n \nLoss of response to filgrastim \nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your \ndoctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which \nneutralise filgrastim’s activity \nYour doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet. \nIf you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the \nblood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)) You should talk to your doctor about your risks \nof developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to \ndevelop cancers of the blood, you should not use Accofil, unless instructed by your doctor. \nIf you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between16 and 60 years. \n \nTake special care with other products that stimulate white blood cells \nAccofil is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of white blood cells. Your \nhealthcare professional should always record the exact product you are using. \n \nOther medicines and Accofil \n \nYou should not receive Accofil in the 24 hours before and the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy. \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAccofil has not been tested in pregnant women. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\nIt is important to tell your doctor if you:  \n• are pregnant or breast-feeding; \n• think you may be pregnant; or \n• are planning to have a baby. \n\n  \nIt is unknown whether filgrastim passes over into the breast milk. Therefore, your doctor may decide \nthat you should not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAccofil may have a minor influence on  your ability to drive and use machines. This medicine may \ncause dizziness. It is advisable to wait and see how you feel after taking Accofil and before driving or \noperating machinery.  \n \nAccofil contains sorbitol and sodium \n \nThis medicine contains sorbitol. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to \nsome sugars (fructose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine.  \n \nThis medicine also contains sodium less than 1mmol sodium (0.035 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’.  \n \n \n3. How to use Accofil \n \nAlways use Accofil exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe amount of Accofil you need will depend on the condition you are taking Accofil for and on your \nbodyweight. \n \nDosage \n \nAccofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) associated with chemotherapy  \n \nThe usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day. For example, \nif you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 30 million units (300 micrograms). Your treatment \nwith Accofil will usually last for about 14 days. In some disease types, however, longer treatment \nlasting up to about one month may be required. \n \nAccofil and bone marrow transplantation  \n \nThe usual starting dose is 1 million units (10 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day given \nas an infusion. For example, if you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 60 million units (600 \nmicrograms). You will normally receive your first dose of Accofil at least 24 hours after your \nchemotherapy and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. Your doctor may \nthen test your blood to see how well the treatment is working and how long it should last. \n \nAccofil and severe chronic neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells)  \n \nThe usual starting dose is between 0.5 million units  (5 micrograms) and 1.2 million units (12 \nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day in a single or divided dose. Your doctor may then test \nyour blood to see how well your treatment with Accofil is working and to find the dose that is best for \nyou. Long-term treatment with Accofil is required for reduction in neutropenia. \n \nAccofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) in patients with HIV infection  \n \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\nThe usual starting dose is between 0.1 million units (1 micrograms) and 0.4 million units (4 \nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Your doctor may test your blood at regular intervals \nto see how well the Accofil treatment is working. Once the number of white cells in your blood has \nreturned to normal it may be possible to reduce the dose frequency to less than once per day. Long \nterm treatment with Accofil may be required to maintain a normal number of white cells in your \nblood.  \n \nAccofil and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (stem cells collected from the blood to use in \nbone marrow transplantation) \n \nIf you are donating stem cells for yourself, the usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) to 1 \nmillion units (10 micrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Accofil treatment will last for up to \n2 weeks. Your doctor will monitor your blood to determine the best time to collect the stem cells.  \nIf you are acting as a stem cell donor for another person, the usual dose is 1 million units (10 \nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Accofil treatment will last for 4 to 5 days. Your \ndoctor will perform regular blood tests to determine the best time to collect the stem cells. \n \nHow Accofil is given \n \nThis medicine is given by injection, either through an intravenous (IV) infusion (drip) or by a \nsubcutaneous (SC) injection into the tissue just under the skin.  \n \nIf you are receiving this medicine by subcutaneous injection, your doctor may suggest that you learn \nhow to give yourself the injections. Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do this \n(see information below on instructions for injecting Accofil). Do not attempt to self-administer \nwithout this training. Some of the information you require is given at the end of this leaflet, but proper \ntreatment of your disease requires close and constant co-operation with your doctor. \n \nInformation for injecting yourself  \nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Accofil. It is important that \nyou do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor \nor nurse. If you are not sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any questions, please ask \nyour doctor or nurse for help. \n \nHow do I inject Accofil myself?  \nYou will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a \nsubcutaneous injection. You will need to have your injections at about the same time every day. \n \nEquipment that you need  \nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  \n• a pre-filled syringe of Accofil; \n• alcohol swab or similar. \n \nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Accofil?  \nEnsure the needle cover remains on the syringe until just before you are ready to inject. \na. Take your Accofil pre-filled syringe out of the refrigerator. \nb. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed \nthe last day of the month shown or if it has been kept outside of the refrigerator for more than 15 days \nor has otherwise expired. \nc. Check the appearance of Accofil. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles in \nit, you must not use it. \nd. For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room \ntemperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. Do not warm Accofil \nin any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). \ne. Wash your hands thoroughly. \nf. Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach them (the \nAccofil pre-filled syringe and alcohol swab). \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \nHow do I prepare my Accofil injection?  \nBefore you inject Accofil you must do the following:  \n1. Hold the syringe and gently take the cover from the needle without twisting. Pull straight as \nshown in pictures 1 and 2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger. \n \n\n1 \n\n \n  \n\n2 \n\n \n \n2. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. . You do not have to remove the air \nbubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless. \n3. The syringe may contain more liquid than you need. Use the scale on the syringe barrel as \nfollows to set the correct dose of Accofil that your doctor prescribed. Eject unnecessary liquid by \npushing the plunger up to the number (mL) on the syringe that matches the prescribed dose. \n4. Check again to make sure the correct dose of Accofil is in the syringe. \n5. You can now use the pre-filled syringe. \n \nWhere should I give my injection?  \nThe most suitable places to inject yourself are:  \n• the top of your thighs; and  \n• the abdomen, except for the area around the navel (see picture 3). \n \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n3 \n\n \n \nIf someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your arms (see picture 4). \n \n\n4 \n\n \n \nIt is better to change the injection site every day to avoid the risk of soreness at any one site.  \n \nHow do I give my injection?  \na. Disinfect the injection site by using an alcohol swab and pinch the skin between your thumb and \nforefinger, without squeezing it (see picture 5).  \n \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n5 \n\n \n \nPre-filled syringe without needle safety guard \n \nb. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor (see picture 6).  \nc. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood \nin the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place.  \nd. Always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose \nhas been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. Do not release the pressure on the \nplunger! \ne. Inject only the dose your doctor has told you. \nf. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle while maintaining pressure on the plunger and then let \ngo of your skin. \ng. Put the used syringe in the disposal container. Use each syringe only for one injection. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n \nPre-filled syringe with needle safety guard \n \nh. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor (see picture 7).  \ni. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood in \nthe syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place.  \nj. Inject only the dose your doctor has told you following the instructions below. \nk. Always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly while grasping the \nfinger flange until the entire dose has been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. Do \nnot release the pressure on the plunger!  \nl. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle while keeping the syringe at the same angle and \nmaintaining pressure on the plunger, then let go of your skin. The protective sleeve will automatically \ncover the needle and an audible “click” will be heard to confirm shield activation (see picture 8). The \nneedle guard will not activate unless the entire dose has been given. \n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \nRemember  \nIf you have any problems, please do not be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice.  \n \nDisposing of used syringes  \n• The needle safety guard prevents needle stick injuries after use, so no special precautions for \ndisposal are required. Dispose of the syringe as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nIf you use more Accofil than you should \n \nIf you use more Accofil than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to use Accofil \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten injection. Contact your doctor to discuss when \nyou should inject the next dose. \n \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\nIf you stop using Accofil \n \nYour doctor will tell you when to stop using Accofil. It is quite normal to have a number of courses of \ntreatment with Accofil.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately during treatment: \n \n• if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the face, lips, \nmouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). Hypersensitivity is common \nin patients with cancer; \n• if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of Acute \nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is uncommon in patients with cancer;  \n• if you get left upper belly (abdonimal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your \nshoulder since this may relate to a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen \n(splenomegaly) or rupture of the spleen).. if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and \nyou have blood in your urine (haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you \nexperience this side effect or if protein is found in your urine (proteinuria). \n• If you have any of the following or a combination of the following side effects: swelling or \npuffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal \nswelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These symptoms generally develop \nin a rapid fashion.  \n \nThese could be symptoms of an uncommon condition (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) called \nCapillary Leak Syndrome which causes the blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body \nand needs urgent medical attention.  \n \n• If you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: \n  - fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, \nshortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin. \n \nThese could be symptoms of a condition called “sepsis” (also called \"blood poisoning\"), a \nsevere infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and \nneeds urgent medical attention. \n \nif you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients who \nreceived Accofil. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood \nin your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual \n \nA very frequent side effect of Accofil use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), \nwhich can be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a \nstem cell or bone marrow transplant, Graft versus host disease (GvHD) may occur- this is a reaction of \nthe donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the \npalms of your hands and soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your \neyes, lungs, vagina and joints. Very commonly seen in normal stem cells donors is increase in white \nblood cells (leukocytosis) and decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot \n(thrombocytopenia), these will be monitored by your doctor. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\nVery common side effects (seen in more than 1 in 10 people who take Accofil): \n• vomiting \n• nausea \n• unusual hair loss or thinning (alopecia) \n• tiredness (fatigue) \n• soreness and swelling of the digestive tract lining which runs from the mouth to the anus (mucosal \ninflammation) \n• decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot (thrombocytopenia) \n• low red blood cell count (anaemia) \n• fever (pyrexia) \n• headache \n• diarrhoea \n \nCommon side effects (seen in more than 1 in 100 people taking Accofil):  \n• inflammation of the lung (bronchitis) \n• upper respiratory tract infection \n•  urinary tract infection \n•  decreased appetite \n•  trouble sleeping (insomnia) \n•  dizziness \n•  decreased feeling of sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoaesthesia) \n•  tingling or numbness of the hands or feet (paraesthesia) \n•  low blood pressure (hypotension) \n•  high blood pressure (hypertension) \n•  cough \n•  coughing up blood (haemoptysis) \n•  pain in your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal pain) \n•  nose bleeds (epistaxis) \n•  constipation \n•  oral pain \n•  enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) \n•  rash \n•  redness of the skin (erythema) \n•  muscle spasm \n•  pain when passing urine (dysuria) \n•  chest pain \n•  pain \n•  generalised weakness (asthenia) \n•  generally feeling unwell (malaise) \n•  swelling in the hands and feet (oedema peripheral) \n•  increase of certain enzymes in the blood \n•  changes in blood chemistry \n•  transfusion reaction \n \nUncommon side effects (seen in more than 1 in 1000 people taking Accofil):  \n•  increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) \n•  allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) \n•  rejection of transplanted bone marrow (graft versus host disease) \n•  high uric acid levels in the blood, which may cause gout (hyperuricaemia) (Blood uric acid \n\nincreased) \n•  liver damage caused by blocking of the small veins within the liver (veno-occlusive disease) \n•  lungs do not function as they should, causing breathlessness (respiratory failure) \n•  swelling and/or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) \n•  inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\n•  abnormal x-rays of the lungs (lung infiltration) \n•  bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage) \n•  lack of absorption of oxygen in the lung (hypoxia) \n•  bumpy skin rash (rash macuo-papular) \n•  disease which causes bones to become less dense, making them weaker, more brittle and likely \n\nto break (osteoporosis) \n•  injection site reaction \n \nRare side effects (seen in more than 1 in 10,000 people taking Accofil): \n• Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the \n\nheart to the body), see section 2. \n•  severe pain in the bones, chest, gut or joints (sickle cell anaemia with crisis) \n•  sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) \n•  pain and swelling of the joints, similar to gout (pseudogout) \n•  a change in how your body regulates fluids within your body and may result in puffiness (fluid \n\nvolume disturbances) \n•  inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous vasculitis) \n•  plum-coloured, raised, painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with a fever \n\n(Sweets syndrome) \n•  worsening of rheumatoid arthritis \n•  unusual change in the urine \n•  bone density decreased \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. \n \nReporting of side effects  \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet.

In view of the possible risk of microbial contamination, \nAccofil syringes are for single use only. \n \nAccidental exposure to freezing temperatures for up to 24 hours does not affect the stability of \nAccofil. If exposure has been greater than 24 hours or frozen more than once then Accofil should NOT \nbe used.  \n \nIn order to improve traceability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, the product name (Accofil) \nand batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file \n \nAccofil should not be diluted with sodium chloride solution. This medicinal product must not be \nmixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned below. Diluted filgrastim may be \nadsorbed to glass and plastic materials except diluted, as mentioned below. \n \nIf required, Accofil may be diluted in 5% glucose. Dilution to a final concentration less than 0.2 MU \n(2 µg) per ml is not recommended at any time. \n \nThe solution should be visually inspected prior to use. Only clear solutions without particles should be \nused.  \n \nFor patients treated with filgrastim diluted to concentrations below 1.5 MU (15 µg) per ml, human \nserum albumin (HSA) should be added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Example: In a final \ninjection volume of 20 ml, total doses of filgrastim less than 30 MU (300 µg) should be given with 0.2 \nml of 200 mg/ml (20%) human albumin solution added. \n \nWhen diluted in 5% glucose, Accofil is compatible with glass and a variety of plastics including PVC, \npolyolefin (a co-polymer of polypropylene and polyethylene) and polypropylene. \n \nAfter dilution:  \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted solution for infusion has been demonstrated for \n24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used \nimmediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless \ndilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nUsing the pre-filled syringe with a needle safety guard  \n \nThe needle safety guard covers the needle after injection to prevent needle stick injury. This does not \naffect normal operation of the syringe. Depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose has \nbeen given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. While maintaining pressure on the \nplunger, remove the syringe from the patient. The needle safety guard will cover the needle when \nreleasing the plunger.  \n \nUsing the pre-filled syringe without a needle safety guard \n \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\nAdminister the dose as per standard protocol. \n \nDisposal  \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
