CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nDuzallo is indicated in adults for the treatment of hyperuricaemia in gout patients who have not \nachieved target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of allopurinol alone.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nDose titration with allopurinol to an adequate dose must be done before the patient is switched to \nDuzallo.\n\nThe choice of the dose strength of Duzallo depends on the allopurinol dose taken as individual \ntablet(s).\nThe recommended dose is one tablet of Duzallo (200 mg/200 mg or 300 mg/200 mg) once daily. This \nis also the maximum daily dose of Duzallo (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients who are currently treated with allopurinol doses higher than 300 mg can be switched to \nDuzallo 200 mg/200 mg or Duzallo 300 mg/200 mg and should receive complementary doses of \nallopurinol to cover the total dose of allopurinol taken before switching to Duzallo.\n\nPatients should be instructed to stay well hydrated.\n\nPatients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of renal \nevents (see section 4.4).\nThe target serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L). In patients with tophi or persistent \nsymptoms, the target is less than 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L). Testing for the target serum uric acid level \ncan be performed after 4 weeks to consider treatment adjustment to target serum uric acid level.Gout \nflare prophylaxis needs to be considered (see section 4.4).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (≥65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age (see section 5.2); however, elderly patients are more \nlikely to have decreased renal function (see dosing recommendations for renal impairment). \nExperience in very elderly patients (≥75 years) is limited.\n\nRenal impairment\nDuzallo is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 ml/min), with \nend-stage renal disease, in patients on dialysis or in kidney transplant recipients (see sections 4.3 and \n4.4). Based on its mechanism of action, lesinurad may not be effective in these patients (see section \n5.1).\nDuzallo should be used with caution in patients with a CrCL of 30 to less than 45 mL/min (expe-\nrience with lesinurad in patients with an estimated CrCL (eCrCL) less than 45 mL/min is limited).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclasses A and B) (see section 5.2). Duzallo has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment; therefore, no dose recommendations can be given for Duzallo.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Duzallo in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\nDuzallo should be taken in the morning with food and water.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nTumour lysis syndrome or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\n\nSevere renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min), end-stage renal disease, kidney transplant \nrecipients or patients on dialysis (see section 4.2). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPre-existing cardiovascular disease\nDuzallo is not recommended in patients with unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) \nclass III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension or with a recent event of myocardial infarction, \nstroke, or deep venous thrombosis within the last 12 months, due to insufficient data with lesinurad. \nFor cardiovascular patients in a stable condition, the benefit/risk balance should be assessed for each \nindividual patient on an ongoing basis, taking into account the benefits of lowering urate levels versus \na potential increase in cardiac risk (see section 4.8).\n\nRenal events\n\nTreatment with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol was associated with an increased \nincidence of serum creatinine elevations, which are related to increased renal uric acid excretion. \nAdverse reactions related to renal function can occur after initiating Duzallo (see section 4.8)\n\nRenal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of Duzallo and monitored periodically thereafter\n(e. g. 4 times per year), based on clinical considerations, such as baseline renal function, volume \ndepletion, concurrent illness or concomitant medicinal products. Patients with serum creatinine \nelevations to greater than 1.5 times the pre-treatment value should be closely monitored. Duzallo \nshould be interrupted if serum creatinine is elevated to more than 2 times the pre-treatment value or in \ncase of an absolute serum creatinine value greater than 4.0 mg/dL. Treatment should be interrupted in \npatients who report symptoms that may indicate acute uric acid nephropathy, including flank pain, \nnausea or vomiting, and measure serum creatinine promptly. Duzallo should not be restarted without \nanother explanation for the serum creatinine abnormalities.\n\nEffect of CYP2C9 genotype\n\nPatients known to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers should be treated with caution, as the potential risk \nof lesinurad renal-related adverse reactions may be increased (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nHypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson-Syndrome (SJS ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)\n\nAllopurinol hypersensitivity reactions can manifest in many different ways, including maculopapular \nexanthema, hypersensitivity syndrome (also known as DRESS) and SJS/TEN. Re-challenge should \nnot be undertaken in patients with hypersensitivity syndrome and SJS/TEN. Corticosteroids may be \nbeneficial in overcoming hypersensitivity skin reactions.\n\nDuzallo and all additional doses of allopurinol should be discontinued immediately at the first \nappearance of allopurinol-induced skin rash or other signs which may indicate an allergic reaction and \nadditional medical care should be provided as needed.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol may be increased in patients with decreased renal function \nreceiving diuretics (in particular thiazides) and Duzallo concurrently (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nHLA-B*5801 allele\n\nThe HLA-B*5801 allele has been shown to be associated with the risk of developing allopurinol \nrelated hypersensitivity syndrome and SJS/TEN. The frequency of the HLA-B*5801 allele varies \nwidely between ethnic populations: up to 20% in Han Chinese population, 8-15% in the Thai, about \n12% in the Korean population and 1-2% in individuals of Japanese or European origin. Screening for \nHLA-B*5801 should be considered before starting treatment with allopurinol in patient subgroups \nwhere the prevalence of this allele is known to be high. Chronic kidney disease may increase the risk \nin these patients additionally. If no HLA-B*5801 genotyping is available for patients with Han \nChinese, Thai or Korean descent, the benefits should be thoroughly assessed and considered to \noutweigh the possible higher risks before starting therapy. The use of genotyping has not been \nestablished in other patient populations. If the patient is a known carrier of HLA-B*5801, especially in \nthose who are of Han Chinese, Thai or Korean descent, allopurinol should not be started unless there \nare no other reasonable therapeutic options and the benefits are thought to exceed risks. Extra \nvigilance for signs of hypersensitivity syndrome or SJS/TEN is required and the patient should be \ninformed of the need to stop treatment immediately at the first appearance of symptoms.\n\nSJS/TEN can still occur in patients who are found to be negative for HLA-B*5801 irrespective of their \nethnic origin.\n\nAcute gouty attacks (gout flares)\n\nGout flares may occur after initiation of therapy with Duzallo. This is due to reduction in serum uric \nacid levels resulting in mobilisation of urate from tissue deposits. Gout flare prophylaxis needs to be \nconsidered (see section 4.2).\nDuzallo does not need to be discontinued because of a gout flare. The gout flare should be managed \nconcurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment with Duzallo decreases \nthe frequency of gout flares.\n\nImpaction of uric acid renal stones\n\nAdequate therapy with allopurinol will lead to dissolution of large uric acid renal pelvic stones, with \nthe remote possibility of impaction in the ureter.\n\nThyroid disorders \n\nIncreased TSH values (>5.5 μIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term treatment with al-\nlopurinol (5.8%) in a long term open label extension study. Caution is required when allopurinol is \nused in patients with alteration of thyroid function.\n\nClinically relevant interactions with other medicinal products\n\nCYP3A substrates\nLesinurad is a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A (see section 4.5). An induction effect of lesinurad \nshould be anticipated after 2 to 3 weeks of continuous co-administration of Duzallo. Additional \nmonitoring of lipids and blood pressure is recommended in patients using sensitive CYP3A substrate \nlipid lowering medicinal products (such as lovastatin or simvastatin) or antihypertensive medicinal \nproducts (such as amlodipine, felodipine or nisoldipine), since their efficacy may be reduced (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nHormonal contraceptives \nHormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable forms, may not be \nreliable when Duzallo is co-administered. Female patients of childbearing age should practice \nadditional methods of contraception and not rely on hormonal contraception alone when taking \nDuzallo (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nLactose intolerance\n\nDuzallo contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the total\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNot recommended concomitant use with: \n\nSalicylates and non-selective uricosuric active substances such as probenecid\nSalicylates at doses higher than 325 mg per day may decrease the serum uric acid lowering activity of \nlesinurad and should not be co-administered with Duzallo. There are no restrictions for doses of \nsalicylates of 325 mg or less per day (i.e. for cardiovascular protection).\nConsistent serum uric acid lowering was observed in patients who were receiving low dose \nacetylsalicylic acid in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in combination with allopurinol or \nfebuxostat. \nOxypurinol, the major metabolite of allopurinol and itself therapeutically active, is excreted by the \nkidney in a similar way to urate.\nHence, medicinal products with known non-selective uricosuric activity such as probenecid or large \ndoses of salicylates may accelerate the excretion of oxypurinol. This may decrease the therapeutic \nactivity of Duzallo which contains the active substance allopurinol, but the significance needs to be \nassessed in each case.\n\nAmpicillin/amoxicillin\nAn increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or \namoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol compared to patients who are not receiving both medicinal \nproducts. The cause of the reported association has not been established. However, it is recommended \nthat in patients receiving Duzallo which contains the active substance allopurinol an alternative to \nampicillin or amoxicillin is used where available.\n\nDidanosine\nIn healthy volunteers and HIV patients receiving didanosine, plasma didanosine maximum plasma \nconcentration (Cmax ) and area under the curve (AUC) values were approximately doubled with \nconcomitant allopurinol treatment (300 mg daily) without affecting terminal half-life. Co-\nadministration of these 2 active substances is generally not recommended. If concomitant use is \nunavoidable, a dose reduction of didanosine may be required, and patients should be closely \nmonitored.\n\nEpoxide hydrolase inhibitors (e.g. valproic acid, valpromide)\nInhibitors of microsomal Epoxide Hydrolase (mEH) (e.g. valproic acid, valpromide) may interfere \nwith the metabolism of lesinurad. Duzallo should not be administered with inhibitors of mEH.\n\nConcomitant use which needs to be taken into consideration:\n\nDiuretics \nAn increased risk of hypersensitivity has been reported when allopurinol is given with diuretics, in \nparticular thiazides, especially in renal impairment (see section 4.4 and section 5.1).\n\nAngiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nConcurrent use of allopurinol and ACE inhibitors may lead to an increased risk of hypersensitivity, \nespecially if there is pre-existing renal impairment.\n\n6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine\nSerum concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine can reach toxic levels unless dose \nreduction is undertaken. Patients taking Duzallo which contains the active substance allopurinol and 6-\nmercaptopurine or azathioprine must reduce their dose to 25 % of the intended dose of 6-\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nmercaptopurine or azathioprine. Patients should be closely monitored for therapeutic response and the \nappearance of toxicity.\n\nCytostatics\nWith administration of allopurinol and cytostatics (e.g. cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, \nprocarbazine, alkylating agents), blood dyscrasias occur more frequently than when these active \nsubstances are administered alone.\nBlood count monitoring should therefore be performed at regular intervals.\n\nVidarabine (Adenine Arabinoside)\nEvidence suggests that the plasma half-life of adenine arabinoside is increased in the presence of \nallopurinol and hence when these two active substances are administered concomitantly, extra \nvigilance is required to recognize enhanced toxic effects. \n\nCYP3A substrates\nMild to moderate induction of CYP3A by lesinurad may reduce plasma exposures of co-administered \nmedicinal products that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A. In interaction studies conducted in healthy \nsubjects with lesinurad and CYP3A substrates, lesinurad reduced the plasma concentrations of \nsildenafil and amlodipine. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are sensitive CYP3A substrates may \ninteract with lesinurad. In the pivotal clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients using lipid \nlowering or anti-hypertensive medicinal products that were CYP3A substrates required concomitant \nmedicinal product change when treated with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with a xanthine oxidase \ninhibitor, compared with patients treated with placebo in combination with a xanthine oxidase \ninhibitor (35% versus 28%, respectively). The possibility of reduced efficacy of concomitant \nmedicinal products that are CYP3A substrates should be considered and their efficacy (e.g. blood \npressure and cholesterol levels) should be monitored (see section 4.4).\n\nCiclosporin\nAllopurinol can increase the plasma concentration of ciclosporin when concomitantly administered. \nThe possibility of an increased occurrence of ciclosporin-specific adverse reactions is to be \nconsidered. Mild to moderate induction of CYP3A by concomitantly administered lesinurad may \nreduce or eventually reverse this effect. However, no data are available. \nIn transplant patients frequent measurement of ciclosporin levels and, if necessary, ciclosporin dosage \nadjustment is required, particularly during the introduction or withdrawal of Duzallo.\n\nHormonal contraceptives\nLesinurad is a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A and therefore may lower plasma concentrations of \nsome hormonal contraceptives, thereby decreasing contraceptive effectiveness (see sections 4.4 and \n4.6).\n\nCYP2B6 substrates\nBased on in vitro data, lesinurad may be a mild inducer of CYP2B6 but this interaction has not been \nstudied clinically. Therefore, it is recommended that patients are monitored for reduced efficacy of \nCYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz) when co-administered with lesinurad.\nBased on interaction studies in healthy subjects or gout patients, lesinurad does not have clinically \nsignificant interactions with NSAIDs (naproxen and indomethacin) or colchicine.\n\nTheophylline\nInhibition of the metabolism of theophylline by allopurinol has been reported. The mechanism of the \ninteraction may be explained by xanthine oxidase being involved in the biotransformation of \ntheophylline in man. Theophylline levels should be monitored in patients undergoing Duzallo therapy.\n\nChlorpropamide\nIf Duzallo which contains the active substance allopurinol is given concomitantly with chlorpropamide \nwhen renal function is poor, there may be an increased risk of prolonged hypoglycaemic activity.\n\nCYP2C9 inhibitors and inducers\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\nLesinurad exposure is increased when it is co-administered with inhibitors of CYP2C9. Fluconazole, a \nmoderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, increased lesinurad AUC (56%) and Cmax (38%), as well as the amount of \nlesinurad excreted unchanged in urine. Other moderate CYP2C9 inhibitors, such as amiodarone, \nwould also be expected to affect lesinurad pharmacokinetics to a similar degree. Therefore, it is \nrecommended that Duzallo should be used with caution in patients taking moderate inhibitors of \nCYP2C9. Lesinurad exposure is expected to decrease when it is co-administered with inducers of \nCYP2C9 (e.g. carbamazepine, a moderate CYP2C9 inducer). Monitor for decreased efficacy when \nDuzallo is co-administered with a CYP2C9 inducer.\n\nCoumarin anticoagulants\nAn interaction between allopurinol and coumarins has been seen under experimental conditions. The \nclinical relevance is not clear. A possible interaction should be taken into account when a patient on \noral anticoagulants is given Duzallo. All patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants must be carefully \nmonitored.\n\nAluminium hydroxide\nIf aluminium hydroxide is taken concomitantly, allopurinol-containing medicinal products may have \nan attenuated effect. There should be an interval of at least 3 hours between the concomitant use of \nthose medicinal products.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of lesinurad and limited amount of data from the use of allopurinol in \npregnant women.\nStudies in animals with lesinurad do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects.\nStudies with allopurinol are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Duzallo during pregnancy. Female \npatients of childbearing potential should not rely on hormonal contraception alone (including oral, \ninjectable, transdermal, and implantable forms) when taking Duzallo (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nAllopurinol and its metabolite oxypurinol are excreted in human breast milk. Duzallo is not \nrecommended during breastfeeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThe effect of lesinurad and allopurinol on fertility in humans has not been studied.\nIn male and female rats, there was no effect on mating or fertility with lesinurad.\nReproductive studies with allopurinol have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to twenty \ntimes the usual human dose and it was concluded that there was no impaired fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLesinurad has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\nHowever, since adverse reactions such as somnolence, vertigo and ataxia have been reported in \npatients receiving allopurinol (see section 4.8), patients should exercise caution before driving, using \nmachinery or participating in dangerous activities until they are reasonably certain that Duzallo does \nnot adversely affect their ability to drive and use machines.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety of lesinurad 200 mg was evaluated in the Phase 3 combination therapy clinical trials \n(including extension studies). The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with \nlesinurad 200 mg are influenza, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, headache and blood creatinine \nincreased. The serious adverse reactions renal failure, renal impairment and nephrolithiasis have \noccurred uncommonly (less than 1 case per 100 patients) (see Table 1). In clinical trials, most adverse \nreactions were mild or moderate in intensity and resolved while continuing lesinurad therapy. The \nmost common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of lesinurad was blood creatinine increased \n(frequency 0.8%).\nFor allopurinol, undesirable effects may vary in their incidence depending on the dose received and \nalso when given in combination with other medicinal products. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class. Frequency \ncategories are defined according to the following conventions: very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10000 to <1/1000) and very rare \n(<1/10,000).\n\nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified in clinical studies with patients receiving lesinurad 200 mg \nonce daily in combination with allopurinol and those adverse reaction that are established for\nallopurinol alone. \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions by System Organ Class and frequency\n\nSystem \n\nOrgan \n\nClassification\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very Rare\n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations\n\nInfluenza Furuncle\n\nNeoplasms \n\nbenign, \n\nmalignant and \n\nunspecified \n\n(incl cysts and \n\npolyps)\n\nAngioimmunoblastic T-cell \n\nlymphoma\n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders\n\nAgranulocytosis*, aplastic \n\nanaemia*, thrombocytopenia*\n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity*\n\n*\n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition \n\ndisorders\n\nDehydration Diabetes mellitus, \n\nhyperlipidaemia\n\nPsychiatric \n\ndisorders\n\nDepression\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10\n\nSystem \n\nOrgan \n\nClassification\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very Rare\n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders\n\nHeadache Coma, paralysis, ataxia, \n\nneuropathy, paraesthesia, \n\ndrowsiness/somnolence, \n\ndysgeusia\n\nEye disorders Cataract, vision disorders\n\n(visual impairment and blurred \n\nvision), maculopathy\n\nEar and \n\nlabyrinth \n\ndisorders\n\nVertigo\n\nCardiac \n\ndisorders\n\nAngina pectoris, bradycardia\n\nVascular \n\ndisorders\n\nHypertension\n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders\n\nGastro-\n\noesophageal \n\nreflux disease\n\nNausea, vomiting \n\nand diarrhoea\n\nRecurrent haematemesis, \n\nsteatorrhoea, stomatitis, \n\nchanged stool frequency\n\nHepatobiliary \n\ndisorders\n\nImpaired liver \n\nfunction tests Hepatitis\n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders\n\nRash\n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome, \n\ntoxic epidermal necrolysis, \n\nangioedema, medicinal product\n\neruption, alopecia, hair colour \n\nchanges\n\nMusculoskeletal \n\nand connective \n\ntissue disorders\n\nMyalgia\n\nRenal and \n\nurinary \n\ndisorders\n\nRenal failure***, \n\nrenal impairment, \n\nnephrolithiasis\n\nUrolithiasis Haematuria, azotemia\n\nReproductive \n\nsystem and \n\nbreast disorders\n\nMale infertility, erectile \n\ndysfunction, gynaecomastia\n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions\n\nOedema, general malaise, \n\nasthaenia\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11\n\nSystem \n\nOrgan \n\nClassification\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very Rare\n\nInvestigations Blood thyroid \n\nstimulating \n\nhormone \n\nincreased****, \n\nblood creatinine \n\nincreased\n\n* Very rare reports have been received of thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia, \nparticularly in individuals with impaired renal and/or hepatic function\n\n** Photodermatosis, photosensitivity reaction, dermatitis allergic, pruritus and urticaria.\n*** Includes the terms: renal failure, renal failure chronic and renal failure acute. \n**** The occurrence of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the relevant studies did not report any \n\nimpact on free T4 levels or had TSH levels indicative of subclinical hypothyroidism.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRenal events\nDuzallo which contains lesinurad as active substance causes an increase in renal uric acid excretion, \nwhich may lead to transient increases in serum creatinine, renal-related adverse reactions and kidney \nstones (see section 5.1). \n\nCardiovascular safety\nNo increased incidences for adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) were \nobserved in the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled combination therapy clinical studies \n(CLEAR1 and CLEAR2) (see section 5.1).\n\nHypersensitivity\nRare cases of hypersensitivity (photodermatosis, photosensitivity reaction, dermatitis allergic, pruritus \nand urticaria) have been reported with lesinurad during the clinical programme. None of these were \nserious or required hospitalisation.\n\nImmune system disorders \nHypersensitivity reactions may present themselves as fever, skin reactions, chills and arthralgia.\nA delayed multi-organ hypersensitivity disorder (known as hypersensitivity syndrome or DRESS) \nwith fever, rashes, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, pseudo lymphoma, arthralgia, leucopenia, \neosinophilia, hepato-splenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests and vanishing bile duct syndrome \n(destruction and disappearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts) occurring in various combinations. Other \norgans may also be affected (e.g. liver, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, myocardium, and colon). If such \nreactions do occur, it may be at any time during treatment, Duzallo should be withdrawn immediately \nand permanently.\nRe-challenge should not be undertaken in patients with hypersensitivity syndrome.\nWhen generalised hypersensitivity reactions have occurred, renal and/or hepatic disorder has usually \nbeen present particularly when the outcome has been fatal.\n\nSkin reactions \nSkin reactions are the most common reactions and may occur at any time during treatment. They may \nbe pruritic, maculopapular, sometimes scaly, sometimes purpuric and rarely exfoliative, such as \nSJS/TEN. The highest risk for SJS and TEN, or other serious hypersensitivity reactions, is within the \nfirst weeks of treatment. Re-challenge should not be undertaken in patients with SJS/TEN.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nLesinurad\n\nThere is no specific treatment in the event of an overdose, and symptoms of overdose are not \nestablished. \n\nAllopurinol\n\nBased on literature and following ingestion of one single dose of 20 g allopurinol symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dizziness occurred in one patient. In another patient the intake of \n22.5 g allopurinol caused no adverse reactions. A specific antidote is unknown. \n\nIf an overdose is suspected, patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care including \nadequate hydration. Particularly in the case of a co-administration with azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine, absorption-reducing or elimination-increasing measures such as haemodialysis are \nindicated (haemodialysis may be considered in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antigout preparations, preparations inhibiting uric acid production.\nATC code: M04AA51\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDuzallo contains lesinurad and allopurinol, two anti-hyperuricemic active substances with \ncomplimentary mechanisms of actions.\n\nLesinurad is a selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor that inhibits uric acid transporter URAT1. \nURAT1 is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid from the renal tubular \nlumen. By inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases uric acid excretion and thereby lowers serum uric \nacid (sUA). Lesinurad also inhibits OAT4, a uric acid transporter involved in diuretic-induced \nhyperuricaemia.\n\nLesinurad, when combined with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, increases uric acid excretion and \ndecreases uric acid production resulting in greater sUA lowering. \n\nAllopurinol is a xanthine-oxidase inhibitor. Allopurinol and its main metabolite oxypurinol lower the \nlevel of uric acid in plasma and urine by inhibition of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme catalyzing the \noxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. In addition to the inhibition of purine \ncatabolism in some but not all hyperuricaemic patients, de novo purine biosynthesis is depressed via \nfeedback inhibition of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Other metabolites of \nallopurinol include allopurinol-riboside and oxypurinol-7-riboside.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe efficacy of lesinurad 200 mg once daily was studied in 2 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies in 812 adult patients (11% of these patients were elderly, ≥65 years \nold) with hyperuricaemia and gout in combination with allopurinol (CLEAR1 and CLEAR2). All \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13\n\nstudies were of 12 months duration and patients received prophylaxis for gout flares with colchicine or \nNSAIDs during the first 5 months of lesinurad treatment.\n\nDuzallo in inadequate responders\nCLEAR1 and CLEAR2 enrolled patients with gout who were on a stable dose of allopurinol of at least \n300 mg (or 200 mg for moderate renal impairment), had serum uric acid levels greater than 6.5 mg/dL \nand reported at least 2 gout flares in the previous 12 months. Across both studies, 61% of patients had \nmild or moderate renal impairment and 19% had tophi at baseline. Patients continued their allopurinol \ndose and were randomised 1:1:1 to receive lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, or placebo once daily.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both CLEAR1 and CLEAR2 was the proportion of patients \nachieving a serum uric acid target level of less than 6 mg/dL by Month 6. In both studies, significantly \nmore patients treated with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol ≥ 300 mg/day (≥ 200 \nmg/day in subjects with moderate renal impairment) achieved the target serum uric acid level of less \nthan 6 mg/dL by Month 6 and by Month 12 compared with patients receiving placebo in combination \nwith allopurinol (see Table 3).\n\nThe stability of the sustained response was demonstrated with a greater proportion of patients treated \nwith lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol achieving the target serum uric acid level at \neach visit for 3 consecutive months (Months 4, 5 and 6) compared to patients treated with placebo in \ncombination with allopurinol (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Proportion of patients who achieved target serum uric acid levels (<6 mg/dL) \nwith lesinurad in combination with allopurinol - Pooled data from CLEAR1 and \n\nCLEAR2 studies\n\nProportion of patients who met serum uric acid target \n(<6.0 mg/dL)\nN (%)\n\nDifference in proportion\n(95% C.I.)\n\nTimepoint Placebo + allopurinol\n\nN=407\n\nLesinurad 200 mg + \nallopurinol\nN=405\n\nLesinurad 200 mg vs. \nplacebo\n\nMonths 4, 5, 6 48 (12%) 155 (38%)\n0.26\n(0.21, 0.32)\n\nMonth 6 104 (26%) 222 (55%)\n0.29\n(0.23, 0.36)\n\nMonth 12 105 (26%) 203 (50%)\n0.24\n(0.18, 0.31)\n\nLesinurad when added to allopurinol caused a reduction of the mean serum uric acid levels, as \ncompared to placebo, which was sustained in the long term in those patients who continued treatment \n(see Figure 1).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14\n\nFigure 1 Mean serum uric acid levels in pooled clinical studies with lesinurad in combination \nwith allopurinol in patients with inadequate response (sUA ≥6 mg/dL) to allopurinol \nalone\n\nIn each of the studies, a greater proportion of patients treated with lesinurad 200 mg in combination \nwith allopurinol compared with placebo in combination with allopurinol achieved a serum uric acid \nlevel of less than 5 mg/dL by Month 6 (CLEAR1: 29% versus 10%; CLEAR2: 35% versus 5%).\n\nPrimary end-point in patients with renal impairment\nConsistent with the overall population, the proportion of patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (eCrCL 30-89 mL/min) who achieved target serum uric acid levels at Month 6 was 56% \nfor lesinurad 200 mg versus 29% for placebo when added to allopurinol at doses ranging from 200 mg \nto 900 mg. \n\nClinical outcomes - gout flares requiring treatment\nThe rates of gout flare requiring treatment were low and comparable to placebo in the last 6 months of \nthe randomised trials (after gout flare prophylaxis was discontinued) with median scores of zero. In the \nlong-term uncontrolled extension trials, the rates of gout flares requiring treatment further decreased in \nthe 60% of subjects who entered the extension studies and continued treatment with lesinurad 200 mg \nin combination with allopurinol or febuxostat for up to an additional year of treatment.\n\nClinical outcomes - concomitant use of thiazides\nConsistent serum uric acid lowering was observed in patients who were receiving thiazide diuretics in \nthe placebo-controlled clinical studies in combination with allopurinol.\n\nClinical outcomes - renal events\nIn two 12-month placebo-controlled trials of lesinurad in combination with allopurinol versus \nallopurinol alone (placebo), serum creatinine elevations between 1.5-fold and 2-fold over baseline \noccurred in 4.4% of patients on lesinurad 200 mg and 2.2% on placebo; serum creatinine elevations 2-\nfold or greater over baseline occurred in 1.5% of patients on lesinurad 200 mg and 0% on placebo. \nThese serum creatinine elevations generally resolved, most without treatment interruption.

In patients with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of \nrenal-related adverse reactions was similar across all treatment groups: Lesinurad 200 mg (13.4%) and \nplacebo (12.5%). Serious renal-related adverse reactions, e.g. acute renal failure and renal impairment, \nwere reported in patients treated with placebo (0.2%) and in no patients on lesinurad 200 mg. \n\nData from long-term extension studies until 52 months revealed a renal safety profile consistent with \nthat observed in the placebo-controlled studies.\n\nPatients with a history of kidney stones were permitted entry into the 12-month studies of lesinurad in \ncombination with allopurinol. In these studies, kidney stone adverse reactions (nephrolithiasis being \nthe most frequent) were reported in patients treated with lesinurad 200 mg (0.5%) and placebo (1.2%).\n\nClinical outcomes - cardiovascular safety \nIn the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled combination therapy clinical studies, the \nincidences of patients with adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE; cardiovascular \ndeath, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) per 100 patient-years of exposure were 0.60\n(95% confidence interval (C.I.) 0.15, 2.41) for placebo and 0.61 (95% C.I. 0.15, 2.43) for lesinurad \n200 mg, when used in combination with allopurinol (CLEAR1 and CLEAR2). A causal relationship \nwith lesinurad has not been established. \nIn the same trials, all patients with a MACE treated with lesinurad 200 mg had a history of heart \nfailure, stroke or myocardial infarction. Post-hoc analyses in a subgroup of patients with high\ncardiovascular risk at baseline (as defined by transient ischemic attack, angina pectoris, heart failure, \nmyocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and/or stroke), showed that the incidence of MACE\nwas 0/39 for placebo and 2/43 for lesinurad 200 mg.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nDuzallo in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment and prevention of hyperuricaemia \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nLesinurad\nThe absolute bioavailability of lesinurad is approximately 100%. Lesinurad is rapidly absorbed after \noral administration. Administration of Duzallo with a high-fat/high-calorie meal did not affect \nlesinurad AUC while Cmax was reduced by 46% and Tmax increased from 2 to 4.5 h compared to \nadministration under fasting conditions.\nIn clinical trials, lesinurad was administered with food, because the serum uric acid lowering was \nimproved under fed conditions (see section 4.2).\nLesinurad is administered as a 50:50 mixture of lesinurad atropisomers. The ratio of atropisomer 1 to \natropisomer 2 AUC(0-24) was 44:56 because atropisomer 1 undergoes more extensive metabolism \nthan atropisomer 2, causing atropisomer 1 to have lower plasma exposure than atropisomer 2.\n\nAllopurinol\nAllopurinol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is reported to have a plasma half-life \nof about one hour. \nAdministration of Duzallo with a high-fat/high-calorie meal did not affect allopurinol AUC while Cmax\nwas reduced by 18% and Tmax increased from 1.25 to 3 h compared to administration under fasting \nconditions. Oxypurinol AUC and Cmax was not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16\n\nLesinurad\nLesinurad is extensively bound to proteins in plasma (greater than 98%), mainly to albumin. Plasma \nprotein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The mean \nsteady state volume of distribution of lesinurad was approximately 20 L following intravenous dosing. \nMean plasma-to-blood ratios of lesinurad AUC and Cmax were approximately 1.8, indicating that it did \nnot penetrate or partition extensively into red blood cells.\n\nAllopurinol\nAllopurinol is negligibly bound by plasma proteins and therefore variations in protein binding are not \nthought to significantly alter clearance. The apparent volume of distribution of allopurinol is \napproximately 1.6 litre/kg which, suggests relatively extensive uptake by tissues. Tissue \nconcentrations of allopurinol have not been reported in humans, but it is likely that allopurinol and \noxypurinol will be present in the highest concentrations in the liver and intestinal mucosa where \nxanthine oxidase activity is high.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nLesinurad\nLesinurad undergoes oxidative metabolism mainly via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 to intermediate \nmetabolite M3c (not detected in vivo) and is subsequently metabolised by microsomal epoxide \nhydrolase (mEH) to metabolite M4; there is minimal contribution from CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and \nCYP3A to the metabolism of lesinurad. Atropisomer 1 is extensively metabolised by CYP2C9 \nwhereas atropisomer 2 is minimally metabolised by both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Metabolites are not \nknown to contribute to the uric acid lowering effects of lesinurad.\n\nAllopurinol\nThe main metabolite of allopurinol is oxypurinol. Other metabolites of allopurinol include allopurinol-\nriboside and oxypurinol-7-riboside.\n\nElimination\n\nLesinurad\nRenal clearance is 25.6 mL/min (coefficient of variation CV=56%). Lesinurad is highly protein bound \nand renal clearance is high (as compared to typical human glomerular filtration rate), indicating that \nactive secretion plays an important role in the renal excretion of lesinurad. Within 7 days following \nsingle dosing of radiolabelled lesinurad, 63% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine \nand 32% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in faeces. Most of the radioactivity recovered \nin urine (>60% of dose) occurred in the first 24 hours. Unchanged lesinurad in urine accounted for \napproximately 30% of the dose. The elimination half-life (t½) of lesinurad was approximately 5 hours \nfollowing a single dose. Lesinurad does not accumulate following multiple doses.\n\nAllopurinol\nApproximately 20% of the ingested allopurinol is excreted in the faeces. Elimination of allopurinol is \nmainly by metabolic conversion to oxypurinol by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase, with less \nthan 10% of the unchanged active substance excreted in the urine. Allopurinol has a plasma half-life \nof about 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\nOxypurinol is a less potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase than allopurinol, but the plasma half-life of \noxypurinol is far more prolonged. Estimates range from 13 to 30 hours in man. Therefore effective \ninhibition of xanthine oxidase is maintained over a 24 hour period with a single daily dose of \nallopurinol. Patients with normal renal function will gradually accumulate oxypurinol until a steady-\nstate plasma oxypurinol concentration is reached. Such patients, taking 300 mg of allopurinol per day \nwill generally have plasma oxypurinol concentrations of 5-10 mg/litre.\nOxypurinol is eliminated unchanged in the urine but has a long elimination half-life because it \nundergoes tubular reabsorption. Reported values for the elimination half-life range from 13.6 hours to \n29 hours. The large discrepancies in these values may be accounted for by variations in study design \nand/or creatinine clearance in the patients.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nFollowing multiple once daily dosing of lesinurad, there was no evidence of time dependent changes \nin pharmacokinetic properties and dose proportionality was preserved.\n\nIn vitro assessment of interactions\n\nLesinurad is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and mEH, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1, CYP2C19 \nand CYP3A. In vitro, lesinurad is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but not of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and mEH. In addition, lesinurad is an in vitro inducer of CYP2B6 and \nCYP3A via constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)/pregnane X receptor (PXR). In vivo, lesinurad is \nneither an inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP2C9 and 2C8, but a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A. \nCYP2B6 has not been studied in vivo.\n\nLesinurad is a substrate of OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1. In vitro, lesinurad is an inhibitor of \nOATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3, OAT4 and OCT1 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. However, \nthe in vivo activity of OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1 was not affected by lesinurad. Lesinurad is \nnot an in vitro inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B3, MRP2, MRP4, OCT2, MATE1, \nMATE2-K and BSEP.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nLesinurad\nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis of clinical data in gout patients treated for up to 12 months \nestimated increases in lesinurad exposure of approximately 12%, 31% and 65% in patients with mild, \nmoderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with patients with normal renal \nfunction.\n\nFollowing administration of a single dose of lesinurad to individuals with renal impairment compared \nto those with normal renal function lesinurad Cmax and AUC, respectively, were 36% and 30% higher \n(200 mg) in patients with mild renal impairment (eCrCL 60 to 89 mL/min), 20% and 73% higher \n(200 mg) and 3% and 50% higher (400 mg) in patients with moderate renal impairment (eCrCL 30 to \n59 mL/min), and 13% higher and 113% higher (400 mg) in patients with severe renal impairment \n(eCrCL <30 mL/min).\n\nAllopurinol\nAllopurinol and oxypurinol clearance is greatly reduced in patients with poor renal function resulting \nin higher plasma levels in chronic therapy. Patients with renal impairment, where creatinine clearance\nvalues were between 10 and 20 ml/min, showed plasma oxypurinol concentrations of approximately \n30 mg/litre after prolonged treatment with 300 mg allopurinol per day. This is approximately the \nconcentration which would be achieved by doses of 600 mg/day in those with normal renal function. \nA reduction in the dose of allopurinol is therefore required in patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nFollowing administration of a single dose of lesinurad at 400 mg in patients with mild (Child-Pugh \nclass A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, lesinurad Cmax was comparable and \nlesinurad AUC was 7% and 33% higher, respectively, compared to individuals with normal hepatic \nfunction. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic \nimpairment.\n\nCYP2C9 poor metabolisers\nApproximately half of an oral dose of lesinurad is cleared via CYP2C9 metabolism. The effect of \nCYP2C9 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad was studied in 8 healthy subjects and 59 \npatients with gout following daily dosing of lesinurad ranging from 200 mg to 600 mg in the absence \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18\n\nor presence of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. At the 400 mg dose, when compared with extensive \nCYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *1/*1 [N=41]), increased lesinurad exposures were observed in \nintermediate CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *1/*3 [N=4], approximately 22% increase in AUC) and \nin poor CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *3/*3 [N=1], approximately 111% increase in AUC) \naccompanied with higher lesinurad renal excretion. However, individual values were well within the \nrange observed in the extensive metaboliser subjects.\n\nPatients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers based on previous history or \nexperience with other CYP2C9 substrates should use Duzallo with caution (see section 4.4).\n\nOther special populations\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, gender, race and ethnicity do not have a clinically \nmeaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad. Based on pharmacokinetic modelling \nsimulations, patients with moderate renal impairment and reduced CYP2C9 activity (co-administration \nof a CYP2C9 inhibitor or a CYP2C9 poor metabolizer) are predicted to have an increase in AUC of \napproximately 200% in comparison to normal renal function and unimpaired CYP2C9 activity.\n\nPharmacokinetics in elderly patients \nThe kinetics of allopurinol are not likely to be altered other than due to deterioration in renal function \n(see section 5.2 renal impairment).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nLesinurad\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development.\n\nAllopurinol\n\nIn animal studies, long-term use of high allopurinol doses resulted in formation of xanthine \nprecipitates, which led to changes in the urinary tract.\n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies conducted to date showed no evidence of mutagenic or carcinogenic \npotential. \n\nOne study in mice receiving intraperitoneal doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg on days 10 or 13 of gestation \nresulted in foetal abnormalities, however in a similar study in rats at 120 mg/kg on day 12 of gestation \nno abnormalities were observed.\nExtensive studies of high oral doses of allopurinol in mice up to 100 mg/kg/day, rats up to 200 \nmg/kg/day and rabbits up to 150 mg/kg/day during days 8 to 16 of gestation produced no teratogenic \neffects\n\n6.

What Duzallo is and what it is used for\n\nDuzallo contains the active ingredients allopurinol and lesinurad. It is used to treat gout in adult \npatients in case allopurinol alone is not controlling your gout. Gout is a type of arthritis caused by the \nbuild-up of uric acid crystals around the joints. By lowering the amount of uric acid in the blood, \nDuzallo stops this build-up and may prevent further joint damage.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Duzallo\n\nDo not take Duzallo if:\n- you are allergic to allopurinol, lesinurad or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6)\n- you have tumour lysis syndrome – a fast breakdown of cancer cells which can cause high uric \n\nacid levels\n- you have Lesch-Nyhan syndrome – a rare inherited illness that starts in childhood where there \n\nis too much uric acid in the blood\n- your kidneys work very poorly or you have end stage kidney disease (when the kidneys no \n\nlonger work well enough to meet the body’s need)\n- you have received a kidney transplant\n- you are on kidney dialysis.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Duzallo if:\n\n- you have or have had heart failure or other heart problems\n- your gout gets worse\n\nSome people may have more gout attacks (sudden or severe pain and swelling in a joint, also \ncalled a gout flare) when they start using Duzallo and during the first weeks or months of \ntreatment. If this happens, keep taking Duzallo and talk to your doctor or pharmacist. The \nmedicine is still working to lower uric acid. Over time, your gout attacks will occur less often if \nyou keep taking Duzallo as advised by your doctor. Your doctor may give you other medicines \nto help prevent or treat the symptoms of gout attacks. and will tell you how long to take these \nother medicines.\n\n- you have thyroid disorders\n\nRash and skin symptoms\nSerious skin rashes (hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis) have occured in patients taking allopurinol. The rash can involve ulcers of the mouth, \nthroat, nose, genitals and conjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). These serious skin rashes often come \nafter flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, body ache. The rash may cover large parts of the \nbody with blistering and peeling of the skin. These serious skin reactions can be more common in:\n\n• people of Han Chinese, Thai or Korean origin \n• people who have problems with their kidneys and take this medicine and a diuretic (a \n\nmedicine that increases urine) at the same time\nIf you develop a rash or any of these skin symptoms, stop taking this medicine and contact your \ndoctor immediately.\n\nKidney problems\nDuzallo may cause serious kidney problems (see section 4). Your doctor will check how well your \nkidneys are working before starting with Duzallo and during the Duzallo treatment. Your doctor may \nstop Duzallo if your blood tests show changes in how your kidneys are working or if you have\nsymptoms of kidney problems. Your doctor may tell you to restart treatment with Duzallo when your \nkidneys improve.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDuzallo is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Duzallo\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Duzallo can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other \nmedicines can affect the way Duzallo works.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:\n\n- acetylsalicylic acid – to relieve fever and pain at doses above 325 mg per day\n- medicines to treat high blood pressure such as ACE inhibitors, water tablets (diuretics -\n\nmedicines that increase the passing of urine) and calcium channel blockers e.g. amlodipine\n- medicines to treat high cholesterol levels, e.g. simvastatin\n- fluconazole – to treat fungal infections\n- amiodarone – to treat heart rhythm problems\n- valproic acid, valpromide, phenytoin or carbamazepine – to prevent fits (seizures), mood \n\ndisorders and prevent migraines\n- bupropion – for treating depression or to help stop smoking\n- sildenafil – to treat erectile problems in men\n- contraceptives – used to prevent pregnancy, including oral contraception (such as ‘the \n\npill’), injections, patches and implants\n- coumarin anticoagulants – to prevent and treat blood clots \n- antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34\n\n- medicines to treat AIDS/HIV e.g. didanosine, efavirenz\n- chlorpropamide, used for the treatment of diabetes \n- theophylline, used for the treatment of breathing problems\n- medicines used to reduce your immune response (immunosuppressants) e.g. ciclosporin, \n\nazathioprine\n- vidarabine, used to treat herpes or chickenpox \n- cytostatics (e.g. cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, procarbazine, alkylating \n\nagents, mercaptopurine), used to treat cancer or rheumatic diseases \n- aluminium hydroxide, used to treat heartburn and acid indigestion (you should leave an \n\ninterval of at least 3 hours between taking the two medicines)\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nDuzallo.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is preferable to avoid Duzallo \nwhen you are pregnant. Ask your doctor for advice.\n\nDuzallo is not recommended during breastfeeding, as allopurinol passes into the breast milk.\n\nHormonal contraception (this includes oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable forms) might not \nbe reliable when taking Duzallo at the same time. Alternative methods of contraception should be \nconsidered. Ask your doctor for advice.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDuzallo may make you feel sleepy, dizzy or unsteady. Do not drive or operate machinery if you are \naffected.\n\nDuzallo contains lactose\nDuzallo tablets contain lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take Duzallo\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. The choice of the dose \nstrength of Duzallo depends on the allopurinol dose already taken as individual tablet(s) and will be \ndecided by your doctor. Your doctor will tell you if additional doses of allopurinol are still necessary.\n\nDuzallo is a tablet to be taken by mouth. The recommended dose is 1 tablet once a day in the morning. \n\nDo not take more than 1 tablet per day.\n\nSwallow the tablet whole with water and after breakfast in the morning. Drink plenty of water during \nthe day to reduce the risk of kidney stones. \n\nIf you take more Duzallo than you should\nIf you take more of this medicine than you should, talk to a doctor or go to the nearest hospital\nimmediately.

What Duzallo is and what it is used for\n\nDuzallo contains the active ingredients allopurinol and lesinurad. It is used to treat gout in adult \npatients in case allopurinol alone is not controlling your gout. Gout is a type of arthritis caused by the \nbuild-up of uric acid crystals around the joints. By lowering the amount of uric acid in the blood, \nDuzallo stops this build-up and may prevent further joint damage.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Duzallo\n\nDo not take Duzallo if: \n- you are allergic to allopurinol, lesinurad or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6)\n- you have tumour lysis syndrome – a fast breakdown of cancer cells which can cause high uric \n\nacid levels\n- you have Lesch-Nyhan syndrome – a rare inherited illness that starts in childhood where there \n\nis too much uric acid in the blood\n- your kidneys work very poorly or you have end stage kidney disease (when the kidneys no \n\nlonger work well enough to meet the body’s need)\n- you have received a kidney transplant\n- you are on kidney dialysis.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Duzallo if:\n\n- you have or have had heart failure or other heart problems\n- your gout gets worse\n\nSome people may have more gout attacks (sudden or severe pain and swelling in a joint, also \ncalled a gout flare) when they start using Duzallo and during the first weeks or months of \ntreatment. If this happens, keep taking Duzallo and talk to your doctor or pharmacist. The \nmedicine is still working to lower uric acid. Over time, your gout attacks will occur less often if \nyou keep taking Duzallo as advised by your doctor. Your doctor may give you other medicines \nto help prevent or treat the symptoms of gout attacks. and will tell you how long to take these \nother medicines.\n\n- you have thyroid disorders\n\nRash and skin symptoms\nSerious skin rashes (hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis) have occured in patients taking allopurinol. The rash can involve ulcers of the mouth, \nthroat, nose, genitals and conjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). These serious skin rashes often come \nafter flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, body ache. The rash may cover large parts of the \nbody with blistering and peeling of the skin. These serious skin reactions can be more common in:\n\n- people of Han Chinese, Thai or Korean origin \n- people who have problems with their kidneys and take this medicine and a diuretic (a \n\nmedicine that increases urine) at the same time\nIf you develop a rash or any of these skin symptoms, stop taking this medicine and contact your \ndoctor immediately.\n\nKidney problems\nDuzallo may cause serious kidney problems (see section 4). Your doctor will check how well your \nkidneys are working before starting with Duzallo and during the Duzallo treatment. Your doctor may \nstop Duzallo if your blood tests show changes in how your kidneys are working or if you have\nsymptoms of kidney problems. Your doctor may tell you to restart treatment with Duzallo when your \nkidneys improve.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDuzallo is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Duzallo\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.
