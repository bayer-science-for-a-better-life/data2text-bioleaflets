PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nClear, colourless to pale yellow sterile solution of approximately pH 6.0. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to \nseverely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who \nare intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kevzara can be \ngiven as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate \n(see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients treated with Kevzara should be given the patient alert \ncard. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Kevzara is 200 mg once every 2 weeks administered as a subcutaneous \ninjection. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n3 \n\n \nReduction of dose from 200 mg once every 2 weeks to 150 mg once every 2 weeks is recommended \nfor management of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver enzyme elevations. \n \nDose modification: \nTreatment with Kevzara should be withheld in patients who develop a serious infection until the \ninfection is controlled. \n \nInitiating treatment with Kevzara is not recommended in patients with a low neutrophil count, i.e., \nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 2 x 109/L. \n \nInitiating treatment with Kevzara is not recommended in patients with a platelet count below \n150 x 103/\u00b5L. \n \nRecommended dose modifications in case of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or liver enzyme \nelevations (see sections 4.4 and 4.8): \n \nLow Absolute Neutrophil Count (see section 5.1)  \nLab Value (cells x 109/L) Recommendation  \nANC greater than 1  Current dose of Kevzara should be maintained. \nANC 0.5-1 Treatment with Kevzara should be withheld until >1 x 109/L.   \n\nKevzara can then be resumed at 150 mg every 2 weeks and increased to \n200 mg every 2 weeks as clinically appropriate. \n\nANC less than 0.5 Treatment with Kevzara should be discontinued. \n \nLow Platelet Count  \nLab Value (cells x \n103/\u00b5L) \n\nRecommendation  \n\n50 to 100 Treatment with Kevzara should be withheld until >100 x 103/\u00b5L.   \nKevzara can then be resumed at 150 mg every 2 weeks and increased to \n200 mg every 2 weeks as clinically appropriate. \n\nLess than 50  If confirmed by repeat testing, treatment with Kevzara should be \ndiscontinued. \n\n \nLiver Enzyme Abnormalities \nLab Value  Recommendation  \nALT > 1 to 3 x Upper \nLimit of Normal (ULN) \n\nClinically appropriate dose modification of concomitant DMARDs \nshould be considered.  \n\nALT > 3 to 5 x ULN Treatment with Kevzara should be withheld until < 3 x ULN.    \nKevzara can then be resumed at 150 mg every 2 weeks and increased to \n200 mg every 2 weeks as clinically appropriate. \n\nALT > 5 x ULN  Treatment with Kevzara should be discontinued. \n \nMissed dose  \nIf a dose of Kevzara is missed and it has been 3 days or less since the missed dose, the next dose \nshould be administered as soon as possible. The subsequent dose should be administered at the \nregularly scheduled time. If it has been 4 days or more since the missed dose, the subsequent dose \nshould be administered at the next regularly scheduled time, the dose should not be doubled. \n \nSpecial Populations \nRenal impairment:  \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Kevzara has not \nbeen studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n4 \n\nHepatic impairment: \nThe safety and efficacy of Kevzara have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment, \nincluding patients with positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) serology (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nElderly:  \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population:  \nThe safety and efficacy of Kevzara in children up to 18 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available.  \n \nMethod of Administration \nSubcutaneous use. \n \nThe total content (1.14 ml) of the pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen should be administered as a \nsubcutaneous injection. Injection sites (abdomen, thigh and upper arm) should be rotated with each \ninjection. Kevzara should not be injected into skin that is tender, damaged, or has bruises or scars. \n \nA patient may self-inject Kevzara or the patient's caregiver may administer Kevzara if their healthcare \nprofessional determines that it is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to patients and/or \ncaregivers on the preparation and administration of Kevzara prior to use. \n \nFor further details on administration of this medicinal product see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability of Kevzara \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nSerious infections  \nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during \ntreatment with Kevzara (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). As there is a higher incidence of infections in the \nelderly population in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly.  \n \nKevzara should not be administered in patients with an active infection, including localised infections. \nConsider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Kevzara in patients who have: \n\u2022 chronic or recurrent infection; \n\u2022 a history of serious or opportunistic infections;  \n\u2022 HIV infection; \n\u2022 underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection; \n\u2022 been exposed to tuberculosis; or \n\u2022 lived in or travelled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses. \n \nTreatment with Kevzara should be withheld if a patient develops a serious infection or an \nopportunistic infection.  \n \nA patient who develops an infection during treatment with Kevzara should also undergo prompt and \ncomplete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial \ntherapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n5 \n\nSerious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other \nopportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including \nKevzara for RA. The most frequently observed serious infections with Kevzara included pneumonia \nand cellulitis (see section 4.8). Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, candidiasis, and \npneumocystis were reported with Kevzara. In isolated cases, disseminated rather than localised \ninfections were observed in patients often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as MTX or \ncorticosteroids, which in addition to RA may predispose them to infections.  \n \nTuberculosis \nPatients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to \ninitiating treatment with Kevzara. Patients with latent or active tuberculosis should be treated with \nstandard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating Kevzara. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior \nto initiation of Kevzara in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an \nadequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent \ntuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. When considering anti-tuberculosis \ntherapy, consultation with a physician with expertise in tuberculosis may be appropriate. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis \nincluding patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. \n \nViral reactivation \nViral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies. Cases of herpes \nzoster were observed in clinical studies with Kevzara. No cases of Hepatitis B reactivation were \nreported in the clinical studies; however patients who were at risk for reactivation were excluded. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nNeutrophil count \nTreatment with Kevzara was associated with a higher incidence of decrease in ANC. Decrease in ANC \nwas not associated with higher incidence of infections, including serious infections.  \n\n\u2022 Initiating treatment with Kevzara is not recommended in patients with a low neutrophil count, \ni.e., ANC less than 2 x 109/L. In patients who develop an ANC less than 0.5 x 109/L, treatment \nwith Kevzara should be discontinued. \n\n\u2022 Neutrophil count should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and according to \nclinical judgment thereafter. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC results see \nsection 4.2. \n\n\u2022 Based on the pharmacodynamics of the changes in ANC, use results obtained at the end of the \ndosing interval when considering dose modification (see section 5.1).  \n\n \nPlatelet count \nTreatment with Kevzara was associated with a reduction in platelet counts in clinical studies. \nReduction in platelets was not associated with bleeding events (see section 4.8). \n\n\u2022 Initiating treatment with Kevzara is not recommended in patients with a platelet count below \n150 x103/\u00b5L. In patients who develop a platelet count less than 50 x 103/ \u00b5L, treatment with \nKevzara should be discontinued. \n\n\u2022 Platelet count should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and according to clinical \njudgment thereafter. For recommended dose modifications based on platelet counts see section \n4.2. \n\n \nLiver enzymes \nTreatment with Kevzara was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations. These \nelevations were transient and did not result in any clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical studies \n(see section 4.8). Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations were observed when \npotentially hepatotoxic medicinal products (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with Kevzara. \n \nInitiating treatment with Kevzara is not recommended in patients with elevated transaminases, ALT or \nAST greater than 1.5 x ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT greater than 5 x ULN, treatment \nwith Kevzara should be discontinued (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n6 \n\n \nALT and AST levels should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months \nthereafter. When clinically indicated, consider other liver function tests such as bilirubin. For \nrecommended dose modifications based on transaminase elevations see section 4.2.  \n \nLipid abnormalities \nLipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Treatment with Kevzara was \nassociated with increases in lipid parameters such as LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and/or \ntriglycerides (see section 4.8). \n \nLipid parameters should be assessed approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of treatment with \nKevzara, then at approximately 6 month intervals. \n \nPatients should be managed according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidaemia. \n \nGastrointestinal perforation \nGastrointestinal perforation has been reported in association with Kevzara in patients with and without \ndiverticulitis. Use Kevzara with caution in patients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or \ndiverticulitis. Patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms such as persistent pain with \nfever should be evaluated promptly (see section 4.8).  \n \nMalignancies  \nTreatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies. The impact of \ntreatment with Kevzara on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were \nreported in clinical studies (see section 4.8).  \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with Kevzara (see section 4.8). Injection \nsite rash, rash, and urticaria were the most frequent hypersensitivity reactions. Patients should be \nadvised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity \nreaction. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Kevzara should be \nstopped immediately. Kevzara should not be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity to \nsarilumab (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment  \nTreatment with Kevzara is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nVaccinations \nAvoid concurrent use of live vaccines as well as live attenuated vaccines during treatment with \nKevzara as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary \ntransmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving Kevzara. Prior to \ninitiating Kevzara, it is recommended that all patients be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation \nof Kevzara therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding \nimmunosuppressive agents (see section 4.5). \n \nCardiovascular risk \nRA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and risk factors (e.g. hypertension, \nhyperlipidaemia) should be managed as part of usual standard of care. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSarilumab exposure was not affected when coadministered with MTX based on the population \npharmacokinetic analyses and across study comparisons. MTX exposure is not expected to be changed \nby sarilumab coadministration; however, no clinical data was collected. Kevzara has not been \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n7 \n\ninvestigated in combination with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors or biological DMARDs such as Tumor \nNecrosis Factor (TNF) antagonists.  \n \nVarious in vitro and limited in vivo human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators \ncan influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) and therefore have the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of \nconcomitantly administered medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes. Elevated levels of \ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) may down-regulate CYP activity such as in patients with RA and hence increase \ndrug levels compared to subjects without RA. Blockade of IL-6 signalling by IL-6R\u03b1 antagonists such \nas sarilumab might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP activity, leading to altered \nmedicinal products concentrations.  \n \nThe modulation of IL-6 effect on CYP enzymes by sarilumab may be clinically relevant for CYP \nsubstrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or \ndiscontinuation of Kevzara in patients being treated with CYP substrate medicinal products, \ntherapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., theophylline) should be \nperformed and the individual dose of the medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.  \n \nCaution should be exercised in patients who start Kevzara treatment while on therapy with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates (e.g., oral contraceptives or statins), as Kevzara may reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 \nand restore CYP3A4 activity, leading to decreased exposure and activity of CYP3A4 substrate. (see \nsection 5.2).Interaction of sarilumab with substrates of other CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP2D6) \nhas not been studied.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after \ntreatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of sarilumab in pregnant women.  \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n \nKevzara should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with sarilumab. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether sarilumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. \nThe excretion of sarilumab in milk has not been studied in animals (see section 5.3). \nBecause IgG1 are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to discontinue sarilumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo data are available on the effect of sarilumab on human fertility. Animal studies showed no \nimpairment of male or female fertility (see section 5.3).  \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKevzara has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n8 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions observed with Kevzara in clinical studies were neutropenia, \nincreased ALT, injection site erythema, upper respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections. The \nmost common serious adverse reactions were infections (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of Kevzara in combination with DMARDs was evaluated based on data from seven clinical \nstudies, of which two were placebo-controlled, consisting of 2887 patients (long- term safety \npopulation). Of these, 2170 patients received Kevzara for at least 24 weeks, 1546 for at least 48 weeks, \n1020 for at least 96 weeks, and 624 for at least 144 weeks.  \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: List of ADRs* \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reaction  \nInfections and Infestations Common Upper respiratory tract infection  \n\nUrinary tract infection  \nNasopharyngitis  \nOral herpes  \n\nUncommon Pneumonia \nCellulitis \n\nBlood and Lymphatic System \nDisorders \n\nVery Common Neutropenia  \n\nCommon Thrombocytopenia  \n\nMetabolism and Nutrition \nDisorders \n\nCommon Hypercholesterolemia \n\nHypertriglyceridemia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Rare Gastrointestinal perforation \n\nHepatobiliary Disorders Common Transaminases increased \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon Injection site erythema  \nInjection site pruritus \n\n* Adverse reactions listed in the table have been reported in controlled clinical studies. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nInfections \nIn the placebo-controlled population, the rates of infections were 84.5, 81.0, and 75.1 events per 100 \npatient-years, in the 200 mg and 150 mg Kevzara + DMARDs and placebo + DMARDs groups \nrespectively. The most commonly reported infections (5% to 7% of patients) were upper respiratory \ntract infections, urinary tract infections, and nasopharyngitis.  The rates of serious infections were 4.3, \n3.0, and 3.1 events per 100 patient-years, in the 200 mg, 150 mg Kevzara + DMARDs, and placebo + \nDMARDs groups, respectively. \n \nIn the Kevzara +DMARDs long-term safety population, the rates of infections and serious infection \nwere 57.3 and 3.4 events per 100-patient years, respectively.   \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n9 \n\nThe most frequently observed serious infections included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of \nopportunistic infection have been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nThe overall rates of infections and serious infections in the Kevzara monotherapy population were \nconsistent with rates in the Kevzara + DMARDs population. \n \nGastrointestinal perforation \nGastrointestinal perforation was reported in patients with and without diverticulitis. Most patients who \ndeveloped gastrointestinal perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedications (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. The contribution of these concomitant \nmedications relative to Kevzara in the development of gastrointestinal perforations is not known (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nIn the placebo-controlled population, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to \nhypersensitivity reactions was higher among those treated with Kevzara (0.9% in 200 mg group, 0.5% \nin 150 mg group) than placebo (0.2%). The rates of discontinuations due to hypersensitivity in the \nKevzara + DMARDs long-term safety population and the Kevzara monotherapy population were \nconsistent with the placebo-controlled population. In the placebo-controlled population, 0.2% of the \npatients treated with Kevzara 200 mg q2w + DMARD reported serious adverse events of \nhypersensitivity reactions, and none from Kevzara 150 mg q2w + DMARD group. \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn the placebo-controlled population, injection site reactions were reported in 9.5%, 8%, and 1.4% of \npatients receiving Kevzara 200 mg, 150 mg, and placebo respectively.  These injection site reactions \n(including erythema and pruritus) were mild in severity for the majority of patients.  Two patients on \nKevzara (0.2%) discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions.  \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nTo allow for a direct comparison of frequency of laboratory abnormalities between placebo and active \ntreatment, data from weeks 0-12 were used as this was prior to patients being permitted to switch from \nplacebo to Kevzara. \n \nNeutrophil count \nDecreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 109/L occurred in 6.4% and 3.6% of patients in the 200 mg \nand 150 mg Kevzara + DMARDs group, respectively, compared to no patients in the placebo + \nDMARDs group. Decreases in neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 109/L occurred in 0.8% and 0.6% of \npatients in the 200 mg and 150 mg Kevzara+ DMARDs groups, respectively. In patients experiencing \na decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC), modification of treatment regimen such as interruption \nof Kevzara or reduction in dose resulted in an increase or normalization of ANC (see section 4.2).  \nDecrease in ANC was not associated with higher incidence of infections, including serious infections. \n \nIn the Kevzara + DMARDs long-term safety population and the Kevzara monotherapy population, the \nobservations on neutrophil counts were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled population \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nPlatelet count \nDecreases in platelet counts below 100 x 103/\u00b5L occurred in 1.2% and 0.6% of patients on 200 mg and \n150 mg Kevzara + DMARDs, respectively, compared to no patients on placebo + DMARDs. \n \nIn the Kevzara + DMARDs long-term safety population and the Kevzara monotherapy population, the \nobservations on platelet counts were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled population.  \n \nThere were no bleeding events associated with decreases in platelet count. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n10 \n\nLiver enzymes \nLiver enzyme abnormalities are summarised in Table 2. In patients experiencing liver enzyme \nelevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as interruption of Kevzara or reduction in dose, \nresulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes (see section 4.2). These elevations were not \nassociated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical \nevidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \nTable 2: Incidence of liver enzyme abnormalities in controlled clinical studies \n \n Placebo + \n\nDMARD \nN = 661 \n\nKevzara 150 mg \n+ DMARD \n\nN = 660 \n\nKevzara 200 mg \n+ DMARD \n\nN = 661 \n\nKevzara Monotherapy \nAny Dose \nN = 467 \n\nAST      \n>3 x ULN \u2013  \n5 x ULN \n\n0% 1.2% 1.1% 1.1% \n\n>5 x ULN 0% 0.6% 0.2% 0% \nALT      \n>3 x ULN \u2013  \n5 x ULN \n\n0.6% 3.2% 2.4% 1.9% \n\n>5 x ULN 0% 1.1% 0.8% 0.2% \n \nLipids \nLipid parameters (LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) were first assessed at 4 weeks following initiation of \nKevzara+ DMARDs in the placebo-controlled population. At Week 4 the mean LDL increased by 14 \nmg/dL; mean triglycerides increased by 23 mg/dL; and mean HDL increased by 3 mg/dL. After Week \n4 no additional increases were observed. There were no meaningful differences between doses.  \n \nIn the Kevzara + DMARDs long-term safety population and the Kevzara monotherapy population, the \nobservations in lipid parameters were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled population.  \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Kevzara.  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled population, 4.0%, 5.6%, and 2.0% of patients treated with Kevzara 200 mg + \nDMARDs, Kevzara 150 mg + DMARDs and placebo + DMARDs respectively, exhibited a positive \nresponse in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay. Positive responses in the neutralizing antibody (NAb) \nassay were detected in 1.0%, 1.6%, and 0.2% of patients on Kevzara 200 mg, Kevzara 150 mg, and \nplacebo respectively.  \n \nIn the Kevzara monotherapy population, observations were consistent with the Kevzara + DMARDs \npopulation.    \n \nAnti Drug Antibody (ADA) formation may affect pharmacokinetics of Kevzara. No correlation was \nobserved between ADA development and either loss of efficacy or adverse events. \n \nThe detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the \nassays used and testing conditions. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to \nKevzara with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. \n \nMalignancies \nIn the placebo-controlled population, malignancies occurred at the same rate in patients receiving \neither Kevzara + DMARDs or placebo + DMARDs (1.0 events per 100 patient-years).  \n \nIn the Kevzara + DMARDs long-term safety population and the Kevzara monotherapy population, the \nrates of malignancies were consistent with the rate observed in the placebo-controlled population (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n11 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are limited data available on overdose with Kevzara. There is no specific treatment for Kevzara \noverdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be closely monitored, treated \nsymptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosupressants, Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC14 \n \nMechanism of action  \nSarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1 subtype) that specifically binds to both soluble and \nmembrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6R\u03b1), and inhibits IL-6-mediated signalling which involves \nubiquitous signal-transducing glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and the Signal Transducer and Activator of \nTranscription-3 (STAT-3).  \n \nIn functional human cell-based assays, sarilumab was able to block the IL-6 signalling pathway, \nmeasured as STAT-3 inhibition, only in the presence of IL-6.  \n \nIL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates diverse cellular responses such as proliferation, \ndifferentiation, survival, and apoptosis and can activate hepatocytes to release acute-phase proteins, \nincluding C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A. Elevated levels of IL-6 are found in the \nsynovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and play an important role in both the pathologic \ninflammation and joint destruction which are hallmarks of RA. IL-6 is involved in diverse \nphysiological processes such as migration and activation of T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, and \nosteoclasts leading to systemic inflammation, synovial inflammation, and bone erosion in patients with \nRA. \n \nThe activity of sarilumab in reducing inflammation is associated with laboratory changes such as \ndecrease in ANC and elevation in lipids (see section 4.4). \nPharmacodynamic effects \nFollowing single-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of sarilumab 200 mg and 150 mg in patients \nwith RA rapid reduction of CRP levels was observed. Levels were reduced to normal as early as 4 \ndays after treatment initiation. Following single-dose sarilumab administration, in patients with RA, \nANC decreased to the nadir between 3 to 4 days and thereafter recovered towards baseline (see section \n4.4). Treatment with sarilumab resulted in decreases in fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, and increases \nin haemoglobin and serum albumin. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe efficacy and safety of Kevzara were assessed in three randomised, double-blind, controlled \nmulticentre studies (MOBILITY and TARGET were placebo-controlled studies and MONARCH was \nan active comparator-controlled study) in patients older than 18 years with moderately to severely \nactive rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. \nPatients had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n12 \n\nPlacebo-controlled studies  \nMOBILITY evaluated 1197 patients with RA who had inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients \nreceived Kevzara 200 mg, Kevzara 150 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks with concomitant MTX. The \nprimary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24, \nchanges from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire \u2013 Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score at \nWeek 16, and change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week \n52.  \n \nTARGET evaluated 546 patients with RA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant \nto one or more TNF-\u03b1 antagonists. Patients received Kevzara 200 mg, Kevzara 150 mg, or placebo \nevery 2 weeks with concomitant conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs). The primary endpoints were \nthe proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24 and the changes from \nbaseline HAQ-DI score at Week 12. \n \nClinical response \nThe percentages of Kevzara + DMARDs-treated patients achieving ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 \nresponses in MOBILITY and TARGET are shown Table 3. In both studies, patients treated with either \n200 mg or 150 mg of Kevzara + DMARDs every two weeks had higher ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 \nresponse rates versus placebo-treated patients at Week 24.  These responses persisted through 3 years \nof therapy in an open-label extension study. \n \nIn MOBILITY, a greater proportion of patients treated with Kevzara 200 mg or 150 mg every two \nweeks plus MTX achieved remission, defined as Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein \n(DAS28-CRP) < 2.6 compared with placebo + MTX at Week 52.

Radiographs of hands and feet were obtained at baseline, 24 weeks, and \n52 weeks and scored independently by at least two well-trained readers who were blinded to treatment \ngroup and visit number.  \n \nBoth doses of Kevzara + MTX were superior to placebo + MTX in the change from baseline in mTSS \nat 24 and 52 weeks (see Table 5). Less progression of both erosion and joint space narrowing scores at \n24 and 52 weeks was reported in the sarilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n \nTreatment with Kevzara + MTX was associated with significantly less radiographic progression of \nstructural damage as compared with placebo. At Week 52, 55.6% of patients receiving Kevzara \n200 mg and 47.8% of patients receiving Kevzara 150 mg had no progression of structural damage (as \ndefined by a change in the TSS of zero or less) compared with 38.7% of patients receiving placebo. \n \nTreatment with Kevzara 200 mg and 150 mg + MTX inhibited the progression of structural damage by \n91% and 68%, respectively, compared to placebo + MTX at Week 52.  \n \nThe efficacy of sarilumab with concomitant DMARDs on inhibition of radiographic progression that \nwas assessed as part of the primary endpoints at Week 52 in MOBILITY was sustained up to three \nyears from the start of treatment.  \n \n\n MOBILITY TARGET \n\nComponent \n(range) \n\nPlacebo  \n+ MTX \n\n(N = \n398) \n\nKEVZARA  \n150 mg \nq2w* + \nMTX \n\n(N = 400) \n\nKEVZARA  \n200 mg \nq2w* + \nMTX \n\n(N = 399) \n\nPlacebo  \n+ \n\ncDMARDs  \n(N = 181) \n\nKEVZARA  \n150 mg q2w* \n+ cDMARDs \n\n(N = 181) \n\nKEVZARA  \n200 mg q2w* \n+ cDMARDs \n\n(N = 184) \n\nTender \nJoints  \n(0-68) \n\n-14.38 -19.25\u2020\u2020\u2020 -19.00\u2020\u2020\u2020 -17.18  -17.30\u2020  -20.58\u2020\u2020\u2020  \n\nSwollen \nJoints  \n(0-66) \n\n-8.70 -11.84\u2020\u2020\u2020 -12.43\u2020\u2020\u2020 -12.12  -13.04\u2020\u2020 -14.03\u2020\u2020\u2020 \n\nPain VAS\u2020  \n(0-100 mm) -19.43 -30.75\u2020\u2020\u2020 -34.35\u2020\u2020\u2020 -27.65 -36.28\u2020\u2020 -39.60\u2020\u2020\u2020 \n\nPhysician \nglobal VAS\u2021 \n\n(0-100 mm) \n-32.04 -40.69\u2020\u2020\u2020  -42.65\u2020\u2020\u2020 -39.44 -45.09\u2020\u2020\u2020 -48.08\u2020\u2020\u2020 \n\nPatient \nglobal VAS\u2021 \n(0-100 mm) \n\n-19.55 -30.41\u2020\u2020\u2020 -35.07\u2020\u2020\u2020 -28.06 -33.88\u2020\u2020 -37.36\u2020\u2020\u2020  \n\nHAQ-DI \n(0-3) -0.43 -0.62\u2020\u2020\u2020  -0.64\u2020\u2020\u2020  -0.52  -0.60\u2020  -0.69\u2020\u2020 \n\nCRP -0.14 -13.63\u2020\u2020\u2020 -18.04\u2020\u2020\u2020 -5.21 -13.11\u2020\u2020\u2020 -29.06\u2020\u2020\u2020  \n* q2w = every 2 weeks \n\u2021 Visual analogue scale \n\u2020p-value <0.01 for difference from placebo \n\u2020\u2020p-value <0.001 for difference from placebo \n\u2020\u2020\u2020p-value <0.0001 for difference from placebo \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n16 \n\nTable 5: Mean Radiographic Change from Baseline at Week 24 and Week 52 in MOBILITY \n \n\n  \n\nMOBILITY \nMTX Inadequate Responders \n\nPlacebo  \n+ MTX \n\n(N = 398) \n\nKevzara  \n150 mg q2w*  \n\n+ MTX \n(N = 400) \n\nKevzara \n200 mg q2w*  \n\n+ MTX \n(N = 399) \n\nMean change at Week 24       \nModified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) 1.22 0.54\u2020 0.13\u2020\u2020 \n\nErosion score (0-280) 0.68 0.26\u2020 0.02\u2020\u2020 \nJoint space narrowing score 0.54 0.28 0.12\u2020 \n\nMean change at Week 52  \n   \n\nModified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) \u2021 2.78 0.90\u2020\u2020 0.25\u2020\u2020 \nErosion score (0-280) 1.46 0.42\u2020\u2020 0.05\u2020\u2020 \nJoint space narrowing score 1.32  0.47\u2020 0.20\u2020\u2020 \n\n* q2w=every two weeks \n\u2020 p-value <0.001 \n\u2020\u2020p-value <0.0001 \n\u2021 Primary end point  \n \nPhysical function response \nIn MOBILITY and TARGET, physical function and disability were assessed by the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI).

In MOBILITY and \nTARGET, patients receiving Kevzara 200 mg + DMARDs every two weeks or Kevzara 150 mg + \nDMARDs every two weeks demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo + \nDMARDs in physical component summary (PCS) and no worsening on the mental component \nsummary (MCS) at Week 24. Patients receiving Kevzara 200 mg + DMARDs reported greater \nimprovement relative to placebo in the domains of Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, \nGeneral Health Perception, Vitality, Social Functioning, and Mental Health. \n \nFatigue was assessed by the FACIT-Fatigue scale. In MOBILITY and TARGET, patients receiving \nsarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs every two weeks or sarilumab 150 mg + DMARDs every two weeks \ndemonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo + DMARDs. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n17 \n\n \nActive Comparator-controlled Study  \nMONARCH was a 24 \u2013week randomised double-blind, double-dummy study that compared Kevzara \n200 mg monotherapy with adalimumab 40 mg monotherapy administered subcutaneously every two \nweeks in 369 patients with moderately to severely active RA who were inappropriate for treatment \nwith MTX including those who were intolerant of or inadequate responders to MTX.  \n \nKevzara 200 mg was superior to adalimumab 40 mg in reducing disease activity and improving \nphysical function, with more patients achieving clinical remission over 24 weeks (see Table 6). \n \nTable 6: Efficacy results for MONARCH \n  \n\nAdalimumab  \n40 mg q2w* \n\n(N=185) \n\nKevzara  \n200 mg q2w \n\n (N=184) \n\nDAS28-ESR (primary endpoint) \n      p-value versus adalimumab  \n\n-2.20 (0.106) -3.28 (0.105) \n< 0.0001 \n\nDAS28-ESR remission (< 2.6), n (%) \n      p-value versus adalimumab \n\n13 (7.0%) 49 (26.6%) \n< 0.0001 \n\nACR20 response, n (%) \n      p-value versus adalimumab \n\n108 (58.4%) 132 (71.7%) \n0.0074 \n\nACR50 response, n (%) \n      p-value versus adalimumab \n\n55 (29.7%) 84 (45.7%) \n0.0017 \n\nACR70 response, n (%) \n      p-value versus adalimumab \n\n22 (11.9%) 43 (23.4%) \n0.0036 \n\nHAQ-DI  \n      p-value versus adalimumab \n\n-0.43(0.045) -0.61(0.045)  \n0.0037 \n\n*Includes patients who increased the frequency of dosing of adalimumab 40 mg to every week \nbecause of an inadequate response \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKevzara (sarilumab) in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic idiopathic arthritis \n(including rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis) \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sarilumab were characterised in 2186 patients with RA treated with \nsarilumab which included 751 patients treated with 150 mg and 891 patients treated with 200 mg \nsubcutaneous doses every two weeks for up to 52 weeks.  \n \nAbsorption \nThe absolute bioavailability for sarilumab after SC injection was estimated to be 80% by population \nPK analysis. The median tmax after a single subcutaneous dose was observed in 2 to 4 days. After \nmultiple dosing of 150 to 200 mg every two weeks, steady state was reached in 12 to 16 weeks with a \n2- to 3-fold accumulation compared to single dose exposure. \n \nFor the 150 mg every two weeks dose regimen, the estimated mean (\u00b1 standard deviation, SD) steady-\nstate area under curve (AUC), Cmin, and Cmax of sarilumab were 210 \u00b1 115 mg.day/L, 6.95 \u00b1 \n7.60 mg/L, and 20.4 \u00b1 8.27 mg/L, respectively. \n \nFor the 200 mg every two weeks dose regimen, the estimated mean (\u00b1 SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin and \nCmax of sarilumab were 396 \u00b1 194 mg.day/L, 16.7 \u00b1 13.5 mg/L, and 35.4 \u00b1 13.9 mg/L, respectively. \nIn a usability study sarilumab exposure after 200 mg Q2W was slightly higher (Cmax + 24-34%, \nAUC(0-2w) +7-21%) after use of a pre-filled pen compared to the pre-filled syringe. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n18 \n\n \nDistribution \nIn patients with RA, the apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 8.3 L. \n \nBiotransformation \nThe metabolic pathway of sarilumab has not been characterised. As a monoclonal antibody sarilumab \nis expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same \nmanner as endogenous IgG.  \n \nElimination \nSarilumab is eliminated by parallel linear and non-linear pathways. At higher concentrations, the \nelimination is predominantly through the linear, non-saturable proteolytic pathway, while at lower \nconcentrations, non-linear saturable target-mediated elimination predominates. These parallel \nelimination pathways result in an initial half-life of 8 to 10 days, and at steady-state an effective half-\nlife of 21 days is estimated.  \n \nAfter the last steady state dose of 150 mg and 200 mg sarilumab, the median times to non-detectable \nconcentration are 30 and 49 days, respectively. \nMonoclonal antibodies are not eliminated via renal or hepatic pathways. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nA more than dose-proportional increase in pharmacokinetic exposure was observed in patients with \nRA. At steady state, exposure over the dosing interval measured by AUC increased approximately 2-\nfold with a 1.33-fold increase in dose from 150 to 200 mg every two weeks. \n \nInteractions with CYP450 substrates \nSimvastatin is a CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 substrate. In 17 patients with RA, one week following a \nsingle 200-mg subcutaneous administration of sarilumab, exposure of simvastatin and simvastatin acid \ndecreased by 45% and 36%, respectively (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \nAge, gender, ethnicity and body weight  \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses in adult patients with RA (ranging in age from18 to 88 years \nwith 14% over 65 years) showed that age, gender and race did not meaningfully influence the \npharmacokinetics of sarilumab. \nBody weight influenced the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab. In patients with higher body weight (>100 \nKg) both 150 mg and 200 mg doses demonstrated efficacy; however, patients weighing >100 Kg had \ngreater therapeutic benefit with the 200 mg dose. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was \nconducted. Mild to moderate renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab. No \ndosage adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe \nrenal impairment were not studied. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was \nconducted (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeated-dose toxicity studies, \ncarcinogenic risk assessment and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. \n \nNo long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenicity potential of \nsarilumab. The weight of evidence for IL-6R\u03b1 inhibition mainly indicates anti-tumour effects \nmediated by multiple mechanisms predominantly involving STAT-3 inhibition. In vitro and in vivo \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n19 \n\nstudies with sarilumab using human tumour cell lines showed inhibition of STAT-3 activation and \ninhibition of tumour growth in human tumour xenograft animal models. \n \nFertility studies conducted in male and female mice using a murine surrogate antibody against mouse \nIL-6R\u03b1 showed no impairment of fertility.  \n \nIn an enhanced pre-/postnatal developmental toxicity study, pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys were \nadministered sarilumab once-weekly intravenously from early gestation to natural birth \n(approximately 21 weeks) Maternal exposure up to approximately 83 times the human exposure based \non AUC after subcutaneous doses of 200 mg every 2 weeks, did not cause any maternal or embryo-\nfetal effects. Sarilumab had no effect on maintenance of pregnancy or on the neonates evaluated up to \n1 month after birth in body weight measurements, in parameters of functional or morphological \ndevelopment including skeletal evaluations, in immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes, \nand in microscopic evaluations.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n64 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nKevzara 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nKevzara 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\nSarilumab \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \nIn addition to this leaflet, you will be given a patient alert card, which contains important safety \ninformation that you need before and during treatment with Kevzara. \n\n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Kevzara is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Kevzara  \n3. How to use Kevzara \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Kevzara  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Kevzara is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Kevzara is \nKevzara contains the active substance sarilumab. It is a type of protein called a monoclonal antibody. \n \nWhat Kevzara is used for \nKevzara is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis if previous \ntherapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. Kevzara can be used alone or together with a \nmedicine called methotrexate. \nIt may help you by: \n\u2022 slowing down damage to joints \n\u2022 improving your ability to perform daily activities. \n\n \nHow Kevzara works \n\u2022 Kevzara attaches to another protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor and blocks its action. \n\u2022 IL-6 plays a major role in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis such as pain, swollen joints, \n\nmorning stiffness, and fatigue. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Kevzara  \n \nDo not use Kevzara: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to sarilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n\u2022 if you have an active severe infection. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n65 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if:  \n\u2022 you have any infection or you get a lot of infections. Kevzara can lower your body's ability to \n\nfight infection: this means it can make you more likely to get infections or make your infection \nworse. \n\n\u2022 you have tuberculosis (TB), symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild \nfever), or have been in close contact with someone with TB. Before you are given Kevzara, your \ndoctor will check you for TB. \n\n\u2022 you have had viral hepatitis or other liver disease. Before you use Kevzara, your doctor will do a \nblood test to check your liver function. \n\n\u2022 you have had diverticulitis (a condition of the lower bowel) or ulcers in your stomach or \nintestines, or develop symptoms such as fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go \naway. \n\n\u2022 you have ever had any type of cancer. \n\u2022 you have recently had any vaccination or are going to have a vaccination.  \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nusing Kevzara. \n \nYou will have blood tests before you are given Kevzara. You will also have the tests during your \ntreatment. This is to check for low blood cell count, liver problems, or changes in your cholesterol \nlevels. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKevzara is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Kevzara \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. \nThis is because Kevzara can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines \ncan affect the way Kevzara works. \n \nIn particular, do not use Kevzara and tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using: \n\u2022 a group of medicines called \u201cJanus kinase (JAK) inhibitors\u201d (used for diseases like rheumatoid \n\n arthritis and cancer) \n\u2022 other biological medicines used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nKevzara can affect the way some medicines work: this means the dose of other medicines may need \nchanging. If you are using any of the following medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using \nKevzara: \n\u2022 statins, used to reduce cholesterol level \n\u2022 oral contraceptives \n\u2022 theophylline, used to treat asthma \n\u2022 warfarin, used to prevent blood clots.  \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTalk to your doctor before using Kevzara if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be \npregnant  or are planning to have a baby. \n\u2022 Do not take Kevzara if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. \n\u2022 The effects of Kevzara on an unborn baby are not known. \n\u2022 You and your doctor should decide if you should use Kevzara if you are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n66 \n\nDriving and using machines \nThe use of Kevzara is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  However, if you \nare feeling tired or unwell after you use Kevzara, you should not drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Kevzara \n \nTreatment should be started by a doctor experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid \narthritis. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nKevzara is given as an injection under the skin (called \u201csubcutaneous\u201d injection). \n \nThe recommended dose is one 200 mg injection every two weeks.  \n\u2022 Your doctor may adjust the dose of your medicine based on results of blood tests.  \n\n \nLearning how to use the pre-filled syringe  \n\u2022 Your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will show you how to inject Kevzara. Following these \n\ninstructions, Kevzara can be self-injected or administered by a care-giver.  \n\u2022 Carefully follow the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d provided in the carton.  \n\u2022 Use the pre-filled syringe exactly as described in the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d. \n\n \nIf you use more Kevzara than you should \nIf you have used more Kevzara than you should, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nIf you miss a dose of Kevzara \nIf it has been 3 days or less since the missed dose: \n\u2022 inject your missed dose as soon as you can.  \n\u2022 then inject your next dose at your regular time.  \n\n \nIf it has been 4 days or more, inject the next dose at your regular time. Do not inject a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten injection.   \nIf you are unsure when to inject your next dose: ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for instructions.  \n \nIf you stop using Kevzara \nDo not stop using Kevzara without talking to your doctor.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.  \n \n \n4.

Kevzara can be used alone or together with a \nmedicine called methotrexate. \nIt may help you by: \n\u2022 slowing down damage to joints \n\u2022 improving your ability to perform daily activities. \n\n \nHow Kevzara works \n\u2022 Kevzara attaches to another protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor and blocks its action. \n\u2022 IL-6 plays a major role in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis such as pain, swollen joints, \n\nmorning stiffness, and fatigue. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n83 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Kevzara  \n \nDo not use Kevzara: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to sarilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\u2022 if you have an active severe infection.  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if:  \n\u2022 you have any infection or, you get a lot of infections. Kevzara can lower your body's ability to \n\nfight infection and this means it can make you more likely to get infections or make your \ninfection worse. \n\n\u2022 you have tuberculosis (TB), symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild \nfever), or have been in close contact with someone with TB. Before you are given Kevzara, your \ndoctor will check you for TB. \n\n\u2022 you have had viral hepatitis or other liver disease. Before you use Kevzara, your doctor will do a \nblood test to check your liver function. \n\n\u2022 you have had diverticulitis (a condition of the lower bowel) or ulcers in your stomach or \nintestines, or develop symptoms such as fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go \naway. \n\n\u2022 you have ever had any type of cancer. \n\u2022 you have recently had any vaccination or are going to have a vaccination. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nusing Kevzara. \n \nYou will have blood tests before you are given Kevzara. You will also have the tests during your \ntreatment. This is to check if you have a low blood cell count,   liver problems, or changes in your \ncholesterol levels. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKevzara is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Kevzara \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. \nThis is because Kevzara can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines \ncan affect the way Kevzara works. \n \nIn particular, do not use Kevzara and tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using: \n\u2022 a group of medicines called \u201cJanus kinase (JAK) inhibitors\u201d (used for disease like rheumatoid \n\narthritis and cancer) \n\u2022 other biological medicines used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nKevzara can affect the way some medicines work: this means the dose of other medicines may need \nchanging. If you are using any of the following medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using \nKevzara: \n\u2022 statins, used to reduce cholesterol level \n\u2022 oral contraceptives \n\u2022 theophylline, used to treat asthma \n\u2022 warfarin, used to prevent blood clots  \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nTalk to your doctor before using Kevzara if you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be \npregnant  or are planning to have a baby. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n84 \n\n\u2022 Do not take Kevzara if you are pregnant \u2013 unless your doctor specifically recommends it. \n\u2022 The effects of Kevzara on an unborn baby are not known. \n\u2022 You and your doctor should decide if you should use Kevzara if you are breast-feeding. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nThe use of Kevzara is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  However, if you \nare feeling tired or unwell after you use Kevzara, you should not drive or use machines. \n \n \n3.
