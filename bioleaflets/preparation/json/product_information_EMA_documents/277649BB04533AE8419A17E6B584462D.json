NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nLuveris 75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne vial contains 75 IU of lutropin alfa (recombinant human Luteinising Hormone {r-hLH}). \nLutropin alfa is produced in genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection.\n\nAppearance of the powder: white lyophilised pellet\nAppearance of the solvent: clear colourless solution\n\nThe pH of the reconstituted solution is 7.5-8.5.\n\nPresentations other than ampoules should be considered for self administration by patients.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nLuveris in association with a Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe Luteinising Hormone (LH) and FSH \ndeficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level <1.2 IU/l. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Luveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nPosology\nIn LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of Luveris therapy in association with FSH is to \ndevelop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the \nadministration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Luveris should be given as a course of daily \ninjections simultaneously with FSH. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous \noestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.\n\nLuveris should be administered concomitantly with follitropin alfa.\n\nTreatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size \nby ultrasound and oestrogen response. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa \n(ie. one vial of Luveris) daily with 75-150 IU FSH. \n\nIn clinical trials, Luveris has been shown to increase the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa. If an \nFSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5 IU-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.\n\n\n\n3\n\nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 microgramsof r-hCG or 5,000 IU to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last Luveris and FSH injections. The \npatient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.\n\nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.\n\nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.\n\nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nOlder people\nThere is no relevant indication for the use of Luveris in the elderly population. Safety and\neffectiveness of Luveris in elderly patients have not been established.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nSafety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of Luveris in patients with renal or hepatic impairment\nhave not been established.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant indication for the use of Luveris in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\nLuveris is intended for subcutaneous use. The first injection of Luveris should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. The powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the \nsolvent provided. Self-administration of this medicinal product should only be performed by patients \nwho are well-motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nLuveris is contraindicated in patients with:\n hypersensitivity to active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland\n ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of \n\nunknown origin \n gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin\n ovarian, uterine, or mammary carcinoma \n\nLuveris must not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, \nsuch as:\n primary ovarian failure\n malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy\n fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In addition, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency and hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific \ntreatment given.\n\n\n\n4\n\nPorphyria\nIn patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria Luveris may increase the risk of an acute \nattack. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment.\n\nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.\n\nMild manifestations of OHSS may include abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort and distension, or \nenlarged ovaries. Moderate OHSS may additionally present with nausea, vomiting, ultrasound \nevidence of ascites or marked ovarian enlargement.\n\nSevere OHSS further includes symptoms such as severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea \nor oliguria. Clinical evaluation may reveal signs such as hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, \nelectrolyte imbalances, ascites, pleural effusions, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe \nOHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary \nembolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.\n\nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol \nlevels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number \nof oocytes retrieved in ART cycles.\n\nAdherence to recommended Luveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise the \nrisk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as \nestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. As OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event, patients should be followed \nfor at least two weeks after hCG administration.\n\nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started.\n\nOvarian torsion\nOvarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated \nwith other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian \ntorsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to \nreduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancy and births is \nincreased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.\n\nTo minimise the risk of higher order multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is \nrecommended.\n\n\n\n5\n\nIn patients undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) procedures the risk of multiple \npregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.\n\nPregnancy loss\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than following natural conception.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART was reported to be higher than in the general population.\n\nCongenital malformations\nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This could be due to parental factors (e.g. maternal age, genetics), ART procedures and \nmultiple pregnancies.\n\nThromboembolic events\nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity \n(body mass index >30 kg/m2), treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for \naggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration \nneed to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself, as well as \nOHSS, also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic events.\n\nReproductive system neoplasms\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility. It is not yet \nestablished whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.\n\nLuveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, \nexcept follitropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter \nthe activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere is no indication for the use of Luveris during pregnancy.\nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of gonadotropins on \npregnancy, embryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following \ncontrolled ovarian stimulation. No teratogenic effect of Luveris has been observed in animal studies. \nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nLuveris.\n\nBreast-feeding\nLuveris is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n\nFertility\nLuveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development, in association with FSH (see \nsection 4.1).\n\n\n\n6\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLuveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nLuveris is used for the stimulation of follicular development in association with follitropin alfa. In this \ncontext, it is difficult to attribute adverse reactions to any one of the substances used.\n\nIn a clinical trial, mild and moderate injection site reactions (bruising, pain, redness, itching or \nswelling) were reported in 7.4 % and 0.9 % of the injections, respectively. No severe injection site \nreactions were reported. \n\nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) was observed in less than 6 % of patients treated with \nLuveris. No severe OHSS was reported (section 4.4).\n\nIn rare instances, adnexal torsion (a complication of ovarian enlargement), and haemoperitoneum have \nbeen associated with human menopausal gonadotropin therapy. Although these adverse reactions were \nnot observed, there is the possibility that they may also occur with Luveris.\n\nEctopic pregnancy may also occur, especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.\n\nList of adverse reactions\nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common \n(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nThe following adverse reactions may be observed after administration of Luveris.\n\nImmune system disorders\nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and shock.\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon: Headache\n\nVascular disorders\nVery rare: Thromboembolism, usually associated with severe OHSS\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea.\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology), ovarian cyst, breast pain, \npelvic pain\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nCommon: Injection site reaction (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site \nof injection)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe effects of an overdose of Luveris are unknown. Nevertheless there is a possibility that OHSS may \noccur, which is further described in section 4.4.\n\nSingle doses of up to 40,000 IU of lutropin alfa have been administered to healthy female volunteers \nwithout serious adverse reactions and were well tolerated.\n\nManagement\nTreatment is directed to symptoms.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC \ncode: G03GA07\n\nLutropin alfa is a recombinant human Luteinising Hormone (r-hLH), a glycoprotein composed of non-\ncovalently bound α- and ß-subunits. Luteinising Hormone (LH) binds on the ovarian theca (and \ngranulosa) cells and testicular Leydig cells, to a receptor shared with human chorionic gonadotropin \nhormone (hCG). This LH/CG transmembrane receptor is a member of the super-family of G protein-\ncoupled receptors; specifically, it has a large extra-cellular domain. In vitro the affinity binding of \nrecombinant hLH to the LH/CG receptor on Leydig tumour cells (MA-10) is between that for hCG \nand that of pituitary hLH, but within the same order of magnitude.\n\nIn the ovaries, during the follicular phase, LH stimulates theca cells to secrete androgens, which will \nbe used as the substrate by granulosa cell aromatase enzyme to produce estradiol, supporting \nFSH-induced follicular development. At mid-cycle, high levels of LH trigger corpus luteum formation \nand ovulation. After ovulation, LH stimulates progesterone production in the corpus luteum by \nincreasing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. \n\nIn the stimulation of follicular development in anovulatory women deficient in LH and FSH, the \nprimary effect resulting from administration of lutropin alfa is an increase in estradiol secretion by the \nfollicles, the growth of which is stimulated by FSH.\n\nIn clinical trials, patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/l as measured in a \ncentral laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH \nmeasurements performed in different laboratories.\n\nIn these trials the ovulation rate per cycle was 70-75 %. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lutropin alfa have been studied in pituitary desensitised female volunteers \nfrom 75 IU up to 40,000 IU. The pharmacokinetic profile of lutropin alfa is similar to that of urinary-\nderived hLH. \n\nAbsorption\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 60 %.\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of \napproximately one hour. The steady state volume of distribution is around 10-14 l. The mean \nresidence time is approximately 5 hours.\n\n\n\n8\n\nLutropin alfa shows linear pharmacokinetics, as assessed by area under curve (AUC) which is directly \nproportional to the dose administered. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and \nrepeated administration of Luveris are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is \nminimal. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with follitropin alfa when administered \nsimultaneously.\n\nElimination\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of Luveris, lutropin alfa is eliminated from the body with a \nterminal half-life of about 10-12 hours. Following subcutaneous administration, the terminal half-life \nis slightly prolonged. Total body clearance is around 2 l/h with less than 5 % of the dose being \nexcreted in the urine. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. As expected from the \nheterologous protein nature of the hormone, lutropin alfa raised an antibody response in experimental \nanimals after a period that reduced the measurable serum LH levels but did not fully prevent its \nbiological action. No signs of toxicity due to the development of antibodies to lutropin alfa were \nobserved.\n\nAt doses of 10 IU/kg/day and greater, repeated administration of lutropin alfa to pregnant rats and \nrabbits caused impairment of reproductive function including resorption of foetuses and reduced body \nweight gain of the dams. However, drug-related teratogenesis was not observed in either \nanimal model.\n\nOther studies have shown that lutropin alfa is not mutagenic.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Luveris is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Luveris\n3. How to use Luveris\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Luveris\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Luveris is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Luveris is\nLuveris is a medicine containing lutropin alfa, a recombinant Luteinising Hormone (LH) which is \nessentially similar to the hormone found naturally in humans, but is made by means of biotechnology. \nIt belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotropins, which are involved in the normal control of \nreproduction.\n\nWhat Luveris is used for\nLuveris is recommended for the treatment of adult women who have been shown to produce very low \nlevels of some of the hormones involved in the natural reproductive cycle. The medicine is used \ntogether with another hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone, (FSH), to bring about the \ndevelopment of follicles, which are in the ovary, the structures maturing the eggs (ova). It is followed \nby treatment with a single dose of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), which leads to the release \nof an egg from the follicle (ovulation).\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Luveris\n\nDo not use Luveris:\n If you are allergic to gonadotropins (such as luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone \n\nor human chorionic gonadotropin), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).\n\n If you have cancer of ovaries, uterus or breast.\n If you have had a brain tumour diagnosed.\n If you have ovarian enlargement or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cyst) of unknown \n\norigin.\n If you have unexplained vaginal bleeding.\n\nDo not use Luveris if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before using this medicine.\n\n\n\n23\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Luveris.\nYou and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.\n\nIt is recommended not to use Luveris if you have any condition that usually makes a normal \npregnancy impossible, such as ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian \nfailure, or malformations of sexual organs.\n\nPorphyria\nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).\n\nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nThis medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome or OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large \ncysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you \nhave difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this \nmedicine (see in section 4 under “Serious side effects”).\n\nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. Luveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. This \nbecomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human \nChorionic Gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3 under “How much to use” for details). \nIf you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you \nmay be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days.\n\nYour doctor will ensure careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood \nsampling before and during the course of treatment.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\nWhen using Luveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of Luveris at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.\n\nMiscarriage\nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy where the embryo \nis implanted outside the womb), whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with \nfertility treatments.\n\nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\nTalk to your doctor before using Luveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots \nin the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots \nor existing clots might become worse with Luveris treatment.\n\nTumours of sexual organs\nThere have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in \nwomen who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.\n\n\n\n24\n\nBirth defects\nBirth defects after Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) may be slightly higher than after \nspontaneous conceptions. This could be due to differences in parental factors like maternal age, \ngenetics, as well as the ART procedures and multiple pregnancy.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nLuveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.\n\nOther medicines and Luveris\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nDo not use Luveris as a mixture with other medicines in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa, \nif prescribed by your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Luveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nLuveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Luveris\nLuveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. It is essentially “sodium free”.\n\n3. How to use Luveris\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not\nsure. \n\nUsing this medicine\nYour doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration, which are most appropriate for \nyou during this course of treatment. \n\nMore user-friendly presentations are available for self administration by patients at home. Consult \nyour doctor to find out if a more suitable alternative may be available for you.\n\nHow much to use\nLuveris is usually used every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of FSH. \n The usual starting dose is 75 IU (1 vial) of Luveris together with 75 IU or 150 IU of FSH. \n According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of FSH by preferably \n\n37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals. \n\nYour physician may decide to extend your treatment up to 5 weeks.\n\nWhen the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24 to 48 hours after \nthe last injections of Luveris and FSH. You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, \nand the day following, administration of the hCG. Alternatively, Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed.\n\nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section \n‘Possible Side Effects’). For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe FSH at a lower dose than \nthat of the previous cycle.\n\n\n\n25\n\nMethod of administration\nLuveris is intended for subcutaneous use which means it is given by injection under the skin. Each vial \nis for single use only.\n\nIf you administer Luveris to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:\n Wash your hands. It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.\n\n Assemble everything you need. Find a clean area and lay out everything:\n- one vial of Luveris,\n- one ampoule of solvent,\n- two alcohol swabs, \n- one syringe,\n- one reconstitution needle for dissolving the powder in the solvent,\n- a fine-bore needle for subcutaneous injection,\n- a sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles.\n\n Open the ampoule of solvent: On the head of the solvent ampoule, you will see a small \ncoloured dot. Directly below it is where the neck of the ampoule has been treated to make it \n\neasier to break. Gently flick the top section of the ampoule \nso that any fluid in the neck of the ampoule drops into the \nbottom chamber. Now press the ampoule firmly over the \nneck, and break the ampoule away from the coloured dot. \nCarefully place the open ampoule upright on the work-\nsurface.\n\n Draw up the solvent: Attach the reconstitution needle to the syringe, with the syringe in \none hand, pick up the open ampoule, insert the needle and \ndraw up all of the solvent.\n\nCarefully set the syringe down on the work-surface, taking \ncare not to touch the needle.\n\n Prepare the injection solution: Remove the protective cap from the Luveris powder vial, pick \nup your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the vial \nof Luveris. Swirl gently without removing the syringe. Do \nnot shake.\n\n After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting \nsolution is clear and does not contain any particles. Turn \nthe vial upside down and gently draw the solution back into \nthe syringe.\n\n\n\n26\n\nYou may also mix Luveris and follitropin alfa as an alternative to injecting each product separately. \nAfter dissolving the Luveris powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the \ncontainer with the follitropin alfa powder. Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into \nthe syringe. Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.\n\nUp to 3 containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.\n\n Change the needle for the fine-bore needle and remove any air bubbles: If you see air bubbles \nin the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing \nupwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects \nat the top. Gently push the plunger until the air bubbles \nare gone.\n\n Immediately inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to \ninject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab. Firmly pinch the\n\nskin together and insert the needle at a 45° to \n90° angle using a dart-like motion. Inject under the \nskin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into \na vein. Inject the solution by pushing gently on the \nplunger. Take as much time as you need to inject all \nthe solution. Immediately withdraw the needle and \nclean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular \nmotion.\n\n Dispose of all used items: Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all \nneedles and empty glass containers in the sharps container provided. Any unused solution must \nbe discarded.\n\nIf you use more Luveris than you should\nThe effects of an overdose of Luveris are unknown, nevertheless there is a possibility that Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome may occur, which is further described in ‘Possible side effects'. \nHowever this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section ‘Warnings and precautions’).\n\nIf you forget to use Luveris\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSerious side effects \n\nContact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor \nmight ask you to stop using Luveris.\n\nAllergic reaction\nAllergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can \nsometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people).\n\n\n\n27\n\nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome\n Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of \n\nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the \ntreatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see also in section 2 under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). If this \nhappens, your doctor will need to examine you as soon as possible.\n\n Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are\nfound very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in\nsection 2 under “Blood clotting problems”).\n\nOther common side effects\n Headache \n Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain\n Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts), breast pain and pelvic pain.\n Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation.\n\nTorsion of the ovary and bleeding into the abdomen have not been reported with Luveris, however, \nthere have been rare cases reported following treatment with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), \na urine-derived medication also containing LH.\n\nEctopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a \nhistory of prior tubal disease.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Luveris\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date, which is stated on the vials after EXP. The expiry date \nrefers to the last day of that month.\n\nDo not store above 25° C. Store in the original package in order to protect from light.\n\nDo not use this medicine if you notice any visible signs of deterioration, such as discolouration of the \npowder or damage to the container.\n\nThe medicine should be administered immediately after dissolving the powder.\n\nThe solution should not be administered if it contains particles or is not clear.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

What Luveris is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Luveris is\nLuveris is a medicine containing lutropin alfa, a recombinant Luteinising Hormone (LH) which is \nessentially similar to the hormone found naturally in humans, but is made by means of biotechnology. \nIt belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotropins, which are involved in the normal control of \nreproduction.\n\nWhat Luveris is used for\nLuveris is recommended for the treatment of adult women who have been shown to produce very low \nlevels of some of the hormones involved in the natural reproductive cycle. The medicine is used \ntogether with another hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone, (FSH), to bring about the \ndevelopment of follicles which are in the ovary, the structures maturing the eggs (ova). It is followed \nby treatment with a single dose of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), which leads to the release \nof an egg from the follicle (ovulation).\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Luveris\n\nDo not use Luveris:\n If you are allergic to gonadotropins (such as luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone \n\nor human chorionic gonadotropin), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).\n\n If you have cancer of ovaries, uterus or breast.\n If you have had a brain tumour diagnosed.\n If you have ovarian enlargement or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cyst) of unknown \n\norigin.\n If you have unexplained vaginal bleeding.\n\nDo not use Luveris if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before using this medicine. \n\n\n\n31\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Luveris.\nYou and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.\n\nIt is recommended not to use Luveris if you have any condition that usually makes a normal \npregnancy impossible, such as ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian \nfailure, or malformations of sexual organs.\n\nPorphyria\nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).\n\nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nThis medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome or OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large \ncysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you \nhave difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this \nmedicine (see in section 4 under “Serious side effects”).\n\nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. Luveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. This \nbecomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human \nChorionic Gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3 under “How much to use” for details). \nIf you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you \nmay be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days.\n\nYour doctor will ensure careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood \nsampling before and during the course of treatment.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\nWhen using Luveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of Luveris at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.\n\nMiscarriage\nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy where the embryo \nis implanted outside the womb), whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with \nfertility treatments.\n\nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\nTalk to your doctor before using Luveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots \nin the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots \nor existing clots might become worse with Luveris treatment.\n\nTumours of sexual organs\nThere have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in \nwomen who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.\n\n\n\n32\n\nBirth defects\nBirth defects after Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) may be slightly higher than after \nspontaneous conceptions. This could be due to differences in parental factors like maternal age, \ngenetics, as well as the ART procedures and multiple pregnancy.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nLuveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.\n\nOther medicines and Luveris\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nDo not use Luveris as a mixture with other medicines in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa, \nif prescribed by your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Luveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nLuveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Luveris\nLuveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose.It is essentially “sodium free”.\n\n3. How to use Luveris \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure.\n\nUsing this medicine\nYour doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration, which are most appropriate for \nyou during this course of treatment. \n\nHow much to use\nLuveris is usually used every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of FSH. \n The usual starting dose is 75 IU (1 vial) of Luveris together with 75 IU or 150 IU of FSH. \n According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of FSH by preferably \n\n37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals. \n\nYour physician may decide to extend your treatment up to 5 weeks.\n\nWhen the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24 to 48 hours after \nthe last injections of Luveris and FSH. You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, \nand the day following, administration of the hCG. Alternatively, Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed.\n\nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section \n‘Possible Side Effects’). For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe FSH at a lower dose than \nthat of the previous cycle.\n\nMethod of administration\nLuveris is intended for subcutaneous use which means it is given by injection under the skin. Each vial \nis for single use only.\n\n\n\n33\n\nIf you administer Luveris to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:\n Wash your hands. It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.\n\n Assemble everything you need. Find a clean area and lay out everything:\n- one vial of Luveris,\n- one vial of solvent,\n- two alcohol swabs, \n- one syringe,\n- one reconstitution needle for dissolving the powder in the solvent,\n- a fine-bore needle for subcutaneous injection,\n- a sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles.\n\n Remove the protective cap from the solvent vial. Attach the reconstitution needle to the \nsyringe and draw up some air into the syringe by pulling the \nplunger to approximately the 1 ml mark. Then, insert the \nneedle into the vial, push the plunger to expel the air, turn \nthe vial upside down and gently draw up all the solvent.\n\nCarefully set the syringe down on the work-surface, taking \ncare not to touch the needle.\n\n Prepare the injection solution: Remove the protective cap from the Luveris powder\nvial, pick up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into \nthe vial of Luveris. Swirl gently without removing the \nsyringe. Do not shake.\n\n After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting \nsolution is clear and does not contain any particles. Turn \nthe vial upside down and gently draw the solution back into \nthe syringe.\n\nYou may also mix Luveris and follitropin alfa as an alternative to injecting each product separately. \nAfter dissolving the Luveris powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the \ncontainer with the follitropin alfa powder. Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into \nthe syringe. Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.\n\nUp to 3 containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.\n\n\n\n34\n\n Change the needle for the fine-bore needle and remove any air bubbles: If you see air bubbles \nin the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing \nupwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects \nat the top. Gently push the plunger until the air bubbles \nare gone.\n\n Immediately inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to \ninject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab. Firmly pinch the\n\nskin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using \na dart-like motion. Inject under the skin, as you were taught. \nDo not inject directly into a vein. Inject the solution by \npushing gently on the plunger. Take as much time as you \nneed to inject all the solution. Immediately withdraw the \nneedle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a \ncircular motion.\n\n Dispose of all used items: Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all \nneedles and empty glass containers in the sharps container provided. Any unused solution must \nbe discarded.\n\nIf you use more Luveris than you should\nThe effects of an overdose of Luveris are unknown, nevertheless there is a possibility that Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome may occur, which is further described in ‘Possible side effects'. \nHowever this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section ‘Warnings and precautions’).\n\nIf you forget to use Luveris\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSerious side effects\n\nContact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor \nmight ask you to stop using Luveris.\n\nAllergic reaction\nAllergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can \nsometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people).\n\nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome\n Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of \n\nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the \ntreatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see also in section 2 under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). If this \nhappens, your doctor will need to examine you as soon as possible.\n\n Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are\nfound very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in \nsection 2 under “Blood clotting problems”).\n\n\n\n35\n\nOther common side effects\n Headache \n Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain\n Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts), breast pain and pelvic pain.\n Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation.\n\nTorsion of the ovary and bleeding into the abdomen have not been reported with Luveris, however, \nthere have been rare cases reported following treatment with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), \na urine-derived medication also containing LH.\n\nEctopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a \nhistory of prior tubal disease.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5.
