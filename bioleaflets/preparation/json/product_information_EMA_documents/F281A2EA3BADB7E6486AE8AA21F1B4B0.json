NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLonquex 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 6 mg of lipegfilgrastim* in 0.6 ml solution. \n \nEach ml of solution for injection contains 10 mg of lipegfilgrastim. \n \nThe active substance is a covalent conjugate of filgrastim** with methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) \nvia a carbohydrate linker. \n \n*This is based on protein content only. The concentration is 20.9 mg/ml (i.e. 12.6 mg per pre-filled \nsyringe) if the PEG moiety and the carbohydrate linker are included. \n \n**Filgrastim (recombinant methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) is \nproduced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nThe potency of this medicinal product should not be compared to the potency of another pegylated or \nnon-pegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 mg sorbitol. \nSodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection) \n \nClear, colourless solution \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLonquex is indicated in adults for reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile \nneutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of \nchronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nLonquex treatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology or \nhaematology. \n \nPosology \n \nOne 6 mg dose of lipegfilgrastim (a single pre-filled syringe of Lonquex) is recommended for each \nchemotherapy cycle, given approximately 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nIn clinical studies with a limited number of elderly patients, there was no relevant age-related \ndifference with regard to the efficacy or safety profiles of lipegfilgrastim. Therefore, no adjustment of \nthe dose is necessary for elderly patients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Lonquex in children and adolescents aged up to 17 years have not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe solution is injected subcutaneously (SC). The injections should be given into the abdomen, upper \narm or thigh. \n \nSelf-administration of Lonquex should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, \nadequately trained and have access to expert advice. The first injection should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. \n \nFor instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and batch number \nof the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. \n \nGeneral \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Lonquex have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose \nchemotherapy. Lonquex should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond \nestablished dose regimens. \n \nAllergic reactions and immunogenicity \n \nPatients who are hypersensitive to G-CSF or derivatives are also at risk of hypersensitivity reactions to \nlipegfilgrastim due to possible cross-reactivity. No lipegfilgrastim therapy should be commenced in \nthese patients because of the risk of cross-reaction. \n \nMost biological medicinal products elicit some level of anti-drug antibody response. This antibody \nresponse can, in some cases, lead to undesirable effects or loss of efficacy. If a patient fails to respond \nto treatment, the patient should undergo further evaluation. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIf a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy with close patient follow-up over several days \nshould be administered. \n \nHaematopoietic system \n \nTreatment with lipegfilgrastim does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia caused by \nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy. Lipegfilgrastim may also cause reversible thrombocytopenia (see \nsection 4.8). Regular monitoring of the platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care \nshould be taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic medicinal products that \nare known to cause severe thrombocytopenia. \n \nLeukocytosis may occur (see section 4.8). No adverse events directly attributable to leukocytosis have \nbeen reported. Elevation in white blood cells (WBC) is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects \nof lipegfilgrastim. A WBC count should be performed at regular intervals during therapy owing to the \nclinical effects of lipegfilgrastim and the potential for leukocytosis. If WBC counts exceed 50 x 109/l \nafter the expected nadir, lipegfilgrastim should be discontinued immediately. \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient positive bone-imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting \nbone-imaging results. \n \nPatients with myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes \n \nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells and some non-myeloid \ncells in vitro. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Lonquex have not been investigated in patients with chronic myeloid \nleukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia; it should therefore not \nbe used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast \ntransformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. \n \nSplenic adverse reactions \n \nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly have been reported after administration of \nlipegfilgrastim (see section 4.8) and infrequent cases of splenic rupture, including fatal cases, have \nbeen reported after administration of G-CSF or derivatives (see section 4.8). Spleen size should \ntherefore be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture \nshould be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain. \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after \nadministration of lipegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Patients with a recent history of pulmonary \ninfiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. \n \nThe onset of pulmonary symptoms such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological \nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function together with an increased \nneutrophil count may be preliminary signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (see \nsection 4.8). In such circumstances Lonquex should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician \nand appropriate treatment given. \n \nVascular adverse reactions \n \nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after administration of G-CSF or derivatives and is \ncharacterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients who \ndevelop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard \nsymptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPatients with sickle cell anaemia \n \nSickle cell crisis has been associated with the use of G-CSF or derivatives in patients with sickle cell \nanaemia (see section 4.8). Physicians should therefore exercise caution when administering Lonquex \nin patients with sickle cell anaemia, monitor appropriate clinical parameters and laboratory results and \nbe attentive to the possible association of lipegfilgrastim with splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive \ncrisis. \n \nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \nmarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8. \n \nHypokalaemia \n \nHypokalaemia may occur (see section 4.8). For patients with increased risk on hypokalaemia due to \nunderling disease or co-medications, it is recommended to monitor the serum potassium level carefully \nand to substitute potassium if necessary. \n \nGlomerulonephritis \n \nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim, lenograstim or pegfilgrastim. \nGenerally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim, \nlenograstim or pegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended (see section 4.8). \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nshould not use this medicinal product. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, i.e. \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, Lonquex \nshould be administered approximately 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. \nConcomitant use of lipegfilgrastim with any chemotherapeutic medicinal product has not been \nevaluated in patients. In animal models, concomitant administration of G-CSF and 5-fluorouracil \n(5-FU) or other antimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Lonquex have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy \nassociated with delayed myelosuppression, e.g. nitrosoureas. \n \nThe potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been \nspecifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are very limited data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) on the use of lipegfilgrastim in \npregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a \nprecautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Lonquex during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIt is unknown whether lipegfilgrastim/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed \nchild cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Lonquex. \n \nFertility \n \nNo data are available. Animal studies with G-CSF and derivatives do not indicate harmful effects with \nrespect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLonquex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequent undesirable effects are musculoskeletal pain and nausea. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported \nmostly in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy after administration of G-CSF or derivatives (see \nsection 4.4 and section 4.8). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of lipegfilgrastim has been evaluated based on results from clinical studies including \n506 patients and 76 healthy volunteers treated at least once with lipegfilgrastim. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below in table 1 are classified according to system organ class. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 \nto <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon Thrombocytopenia* \nUncommon Leukocytosis*, Splenomegaly* \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity reactions* \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon Hypokalaemia* \n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache \nVascular disorders Not known Capillary leak syndrome* \n\nAortitis*  \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Haemoptysis \nUncommon Pulmonary adverse reactions*, \n\nPulmonary Haemorrhage \nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea* \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Skin reactions* \nUncommon Injection site reactions* \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common Musculoskeletal pains* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Chest pain \n\nInvestigations Uncommon Blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased*, Blood lactate \ndehydrogenase increased* \n\n*See section “Description of selected adverse reactions” below \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nThrombocytopenia and leukocytosis have been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nSplenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, has been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions such as allergic skin reactions, urticaria, angioedema and serious allergic \nreactions may occur. \n \nHypokalaemia has been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported (see section 4.4). \nThese pulmonary adverse reactions may also include pulmonary oedema, pulmonary infiltrates, \npulmonary fibrosis, respiratory failure or ARDS (see section 4.4).  \n \nNausea was very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. \n \nSkin reactions such as erythema and rash may occur. \n \nInjection site reactions such as injection site induration and injection site pain may occur. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions include musculoskeletal pains such as bone pain and myalgia. \nMusculoskeletal pain is generally of mild to moderate severity, transient and can be controlled in most \npatients with standard analgesics. However cases of severe musculoskeletal pain (mainly bone pain \nand back pain) have been reported, including cases that led to hospitalisation. \n \nReversible, mild to moderate elevations in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase may occur, \nwith no associated clinical effects. Elevations in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase most \nlikely originate from the increase in neutrophils. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nCertain adverse reactions have not yet been observed with lipegfilgrastim, but are generally accepted \nas being attributable to G-CSF and derivatives: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n- Splenic rupture including some fatal cases (see section 4.4) \n- Sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell anaemia (see section 4.4) \n \nVascular disorders \n- Capillary leak syndrome \n\nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in postmarketing experience after \nadministration of G-CSF or derivatives. These have generally occurred in patients suffering \nfrom advanced malignant diseases, having sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medicinal \nproducts or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). \n\n- Aortitis (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n- Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet’s syndrome) \n- Cutaneous vasculitis \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n- Glomerulonephritis (see section 4.4) \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe experience in children is limited to a single-dose phase 1 study in 21 paediatric patients aged 2 to \n<18 years (see section 5.1), which did not indicate a difference in the safety profile of lipegfilgrastim \nin children compared to that in adults. Treatment-related adverse events were back pain, bone pain and \nincreased neutrophil count (1 event each). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose of lipegfilgrastim. In the case of overdose, WBC and platelet \ncount should be performed regularly and spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical \nexamination, ultrasound). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors, ATC code: L03AA14 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLipegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of filgrastim with a single methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) \nmolecule via a carbohydrate linker consisting of glycine, N-acetylneuraminic acid and \nN-acetylgalactosamine. The average molecular mass is approximately 39 kDa of which the protein \nmoiety constitutes approximately 48 %. Human G-CSF is a glycoprotein that regulates the production \nand release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow. Filgrastim is an un-glycosylated \nrecombinant methionyl human G-CSF. Lipegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of filgrastim due \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nto decreased renal clearance. Lipegfilgrastim binds to human the G-CSF receptor like filgrastim and \npegfilgrastim. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLipegfilgrastim and filgrastim induced a marked increase in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within \n24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes and/or lymphocytes. These results suggest that the \nG-CSF moiety of lipegfilgrastim confers the expected activity of this growth factor: stimulation of \nproliferation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, differentiation into mature cells and release into the \nperipheral blood. This effect includes not only the neutrophil lineage but extends to other single \nlineage and multilineage progenitors and pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells. G-CSF also increases \nthe antibacterial activities of neutrophils including the phagocytosis. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nOnce-per-cycle dosing of lipegfilgrastim was investigated in two pivotal randomised, double-blind \nclinical studies in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy. \n \nThe first pivotal (phase III) clinical study XM22-03 was an active-controlled study in 202 patients \nwith stage II-IV breast cancer receiving up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and \ndocetaxel. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive 6 mg lipegfilgrastim or 6 mg pegfilgrastim. The \nstudy showed non-inferiority of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim to 6 mg pegfilgrastim for the primary endpoint, \nduration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in the first cycle of chemotherapy (see table 2). \n \nTable 2: DSN, severe neutropenia (SN) and febrile neutropenia (FN) in cycle 1 of \nstudy XM22-03 (ITT) \n\n Pegfilgrastim 6 mg \n(n = 101) \n\nLipegfilgrastim 6 mg \n(n = 101) \n\nDSN \nMean ± SD (d) 0.9 ± 0.9 0.7 ± 1.0 \nΔ LS mean -0.186 \n95 % CI -0.461 to 0.089 \nSN \nIncidence (%) 51.5 43.6 \nFN \nIncidence (%) 3.0 1.0 \nITT =  Intent-to-treat population (all randomised patients) \nSD  = standard deviation \nd = days \nCI = confidence interval \nΔ LS mean (least square mean difference lipegfilgrastim – pegfilgrastim) and CI out of multivariate \nPoisson regression analysis \n \nThe second pivotal (phase III) clinical study XM22-04 was a placebo-controlled study in 375 patients \nwith non-small cell lung cancer receiving up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and \netoposide. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either 6 mg lipegfilgrastim or placebo. The results \nof the study are presented in table 3. When the main study was finalised, the incidence of death was \n7.2 % (placebo) and 12.5 % (6 mg lipegfilgrastim) although after the 360-day follow-up period the \noverall incidence of death was similar between placebo and lipegfilgrastim (44.8 % and 44.0 %; safety \npopulation). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 3: DSN, SN and FN in cycle 1 of study XM22-04 (ITT) \n Placebo \n\n(n = 125) \nLipegfilgrastim 6 mg \n\n(n = 250) \nFN \nIncidence (%) 5.6 2.4 \n95 % CI 0.121 to 1.260 \np-value 0.1151 \nDSN \nMean ± SD (d) 2.3 ± 2.5 0.6 ± 1.1 \nΔ LS mean -1.661 \n95 % CI -2.089 to -1.232 \np-value < 0.0001 \nSN \nIncidence (%) 59.2 32.1 \nOdds ratio 0.325 \n95 % CI 0.206 to 0.512 \np-value < 0.0001 \nΔ LS mean (least square mean difference lipegfilgrastim – placebo), CI and p-value out of \nmultivariate Poisson regression analysis \nOdds ratio (lipegfilgrastim / placebo), CI and p-value out of multivariate logistic regression analysis \n \nA post-authorisation safety study XM22-ONC-40041 was conducted to collect data of disease \nprogression and mortality in patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous cell lung cancer \nreceiving lipegfilgrastim in addition to the platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased risk of disease \nprogression or death was not observed with lipegfilgrastim.  \n \nImmunogenicity \nAn analysis of anti-drug antibodies of 579 patients and healthy volunteers treated with lipegfilgrastim, \n188 patients and healthy volunteers treated with pegfilgrastim and 121 patients treated with placebo \nwas performed. Drug-specific antibodies emerging after start of treatment were detected in 0.86 % of \nthe subjects receiving lipegfilgrastim, in 1.06 % of the subjects receiving pegfilgrastim and in 1.65 % \nof the subjects receiving placebo. No neutralising antibodies against lipegfilgrastim were observed. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nLonquex in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced \nneutropenia and prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). In a phase 1 study of 21 children aged between 2 and 16 years with \nEwing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma, lipegfilgrastim was administered as a single \nsubcutaneous dose of 100 μg/kg (up to a maximum of 6 mg, which is the fixed dose for adults) \n24 hours after the end of the last chemotherapy treatment in week 1 of the regimen. The incidence of \nFN varied according to age (from 14.3 % to 71.4 %), with the highest frequency in the oldest age \ngroup. The use of three different chemotherapy regimens, with varying myelosuppressive effects and \nage distributions, complicated the comparison of efficacy across age groups (see section 4.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral \n \nHealthy volunteers \nIn 3 studies (XM22-01, XM22-05, XM22-06) in healthy volunteers, the maximum blood \nconcentration was reached after a median of 30 to 36 hours and the average terminal half-life ranged \nfrom approximately 32 to 62 hours after a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nAfter subcutaneous injection of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim at three different sites (upper arm, abdomen and \nthigh) in healthy volunteers, the bioavailability (peak concentration and area under the curve [AUC]) \nwas lower after subcutaneous injection in the thigh compared to subcutaneous injection in the \nabdomen and in the upper arm. In this limited study XM22-06, bioavailability of lipegfilgrastim and \nobserved differences among the injection sites were higher in male subjects compared to female \nsubjects. Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic effects were similar and independent from gender and \ninjection site. \n \nMetabolism \n \nLipegfilgrastim is metabolised via intra- or extracellular degradation by proteolytic enzymes. \nLipegfilgrastim is internalised by neutrophils (non-linear process), then degraded within the cell by \nendogenous proteolytic enzymes. The linear pathway is likely due to extracellular protein degradation \nby neutrophil elastase and other plasma proteases. \n \nDrug interactions \nIn vitro data indicate that lipegfilgrastim is has little or no direct or immune system-mediated effects \non CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 activity. Therefore, \nlipegfilgrastim is not likely to affect metabolism via human cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nCancer patients \nIn 2 studies (XM22-02 and XM22-03) in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy \nconsisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, mean maximum blood concentrations of 227 and 262 ng/ml \nwere reached after median times to maximum concentration (tmax) of 44 and 48 hours. The mean \nterminal half-lives were approximately 29 and 31 hours after a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg \nlipegfilgrastim during the first cycle of chemotherapy. After a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg \nlipegfilgrastim during the fourth cycle, the maximum blood concentrations were lower than observed \nin the first cycle (mean values 77 and 111 ng/ml) and were reached after median tmax of 8 hours. The \nmean terminal half-lives in the fourth cycle were approximately 39 and 42 hours. \n \nIn a study (XM22-04) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving chemotherapy consisting \nof cisplatin and etoposide, the mean maximum blood concentration of 317 ng/ml was reached after a \nmedian tmax of 24 hours and the mean terminal half-life was approximately 28 hours after a single \nsubcutaneous injection of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim during the first cycle of chemotherapy. After a single \nsubcutaneous injection of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim during the fourth cycle, the mean maximum blood \nconcentration of 149 ng/ml was reached after a median tmax of 8 hours and the mean terminal half-life \nwas approximately 34 hours. \n \nLipegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance, which becomes \nsaturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum \nconcentration of lipegfilgrastim declines slowly during the chemotherapy-induced transient neutrophil \nnadir and rapidly at the following onset of neutrophil recovery (see figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFigure 1: Profile of median serum concentration of lipegfilgrastim and median ANC in \nchemotherapy-treated patients after a single 6 mg injection of lipegfilgrastim \n \n \n\n         \n \n \nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \nDue to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of lipegfilgrastim is not \nexpected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients \nLimited patient data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of lipegfilgrastim in elderly patients \n(65 - 74 years) is similar to that in younger patients. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients \n≥ 75 years. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a phase 1 study (see section 5.1), using a 10 mg/ml solution for subcutaneous injection specifically \ndeveloped for the paediatric studies, the mean maximum blood concentrations (Cmax) were 243 ng/ml \nin the 2 to <6-year group, 255 ng/ml in the 6 to <12-year group and 224 ng/ml in the 12 to <18-year \ngroup after a single subcutaneous injection of 100 μg/kg (maximum 6 mg) lipegfilgrastim with the \nfirst cycle of chemotherapy. The maximum blood concentrations were reached after a median time \n(tmax) of 23.9 hours, 30.0 hours and 95.8 hours, respectively. See section 4.2. \n \nOverweight patients \nA trend towards a decrease in lipegfilgrastim exposure was observed with increase in weight. This \nmay result in lowered pharmacodynamic responses in heavy patients (> 95 kg). Consequent decrease \nin efficacy in these patients cannot be excluded on current data. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance. \n \nIn a study of toxicity to reproduction and development in rabbits, an increased incidence of \npost-implantation loss and abortion has been observed at high doses of lipegfilgrastim, likely owing to \n\nLipegfilgrastim \nANC \n\nM\ned\n\nia\nn \n\nse\nru\n\nm\n c\n\non\nce\n\nnt\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\nof\n li\n\npe\ngf\n\nilg\nra\n\nsti\nm\n\n (n\ng/\n\nm\nl) \n\nM\ned\n\nia\nn \n\nA\nN\n\nC\n (x\n\n 1\n09\n\n c\nel\n\nls\n/l)\n\n \n\nStudy days, injection of lipegfilgrastim at day 0 \n\n\n\n13 \n\nan exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect specific for rabbits. There is no evidence that lipegfilgrastim \nis teratogenic. These findings are consistent with results from G-CSF and derivatives. Published \ninformation on G-CSF and derivatives reveal no evidence of adverse effects on fertility and \nembryo-foetal development in rats or pre-/postnatal effects other than those related to maternal \ntoxicity as well. There is evidence that filgrastim and pegfilgrastim may be transported at low levels \nover the placenta in rats, although no information is available for lipegfilgrastim. The relevance of \nthese findings for humans is not known. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Lonquex is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Lonquex \n3. How to use Lonquex \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Lonquex \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lonquex is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Lonquex is \nLonquex contains the active substance lipegfilgrastim. Lipegfilgrastim is a long-acting modified \nprotein produced by biotechnology in bacteria called Escherichia coli. It belongs to a group of proteins \ncalled cytokines and is similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) \nproduced by your own body. \n \nWhat Lonquex is used for \nYour doctor has prescribed Lonquex for you in order to reduce the duration of a condition called \nneutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia (low white blood \ncell count with a fever). These can be caused by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that \ndestroy rapidly-growing cells). \n \nHow Lonquex works \nLipegfilgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new blood cells are made) to produce \nmore white blood cells. White blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection. These \ncells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in \nyour body to decrease. If white blood cells fall to a low level, there may not be enough left in the body \nto fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Lonquex \n \nDo not use Lonquex: \n• if you are allergic to lipegfilgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse BEFORE using Lonquex \n• if you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. It could be a \n\nconsequence of a spleen disorder (see section4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n\n\n26 \n\n• if you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. It could be a consequence of a pulmonary \ndisorder (see section4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n• if you have sickle cell anaemia, which is an inherited disease characterised by sickle-shaped red \nblood cells. \n\n• if you have previously experienced allergic reactions to other medicines like this one (e.g. \nfilgrastim, lenograstim or pegfilgrastim of the group of G-CSFs). There could be a risk of \nreacting to Lonquex too. \n\n \nYour doctor will carry out regular blood tests in order to monitor various blood components and their \nlevels. Your doctor will also check your urine regularly as other medicines similar to this one (e.g. \nother granulocyte colony stimulating factors such as filgrastim, lenograstim or pegfilgrastim) can \npossibly harm the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis; see section “4. Possible side \neffects”). \n \nInflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) \nhas been reported rarely with other medicines like this one (e.g. filgrastim, lenograstim or \npegfilgrastim of the group of G-CSFs). The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, \nback pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because there is only \nlimited experience in children to show that this medicine is safe and works in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Lonquex \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nYou will normally inject your dose of Lonquex approximately 24 hours after your last dose of \nchemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nLonquex has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, \nthink you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as the doctor may decide that you should \nnot use this medicine. \n \nIt is unknown whether the active substance in this medicine passes into the breast milk. You should \ntherefore interrupt breast-feeding during treatment.. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLonquex has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nLonquex contains sorbitol and sodium \nThis medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Lonquex \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nWhat the recommended dose is \nThe recommended dose is one pre-filled syringe (6 mg lipegfilgrastim) once per chemotherapy cycle. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nWhen to use Lonquex \nThis medicine should be given approximately 24 hours after your last dose of chemotherapy at the end \nof each chemotherapy cycle. \n \nHow are the injections given? \nThis medicine is given as an injection using a pre-filled syringe. The injection is given into the tissue \njust under the skin (subcutaneous injection). \n \nYour doctor may suggest that you learn how to inject yourself with this medicine. Your doctor or \nnurse will give you instructions on how to do this. Do not attempt to give Lonquex to yourself without \nthis training. Information required for using the pre-filled syringe can be found under “Information for \ninjecting yourself”. Proper treatment of your disease, however, requires close and constant \nco-operation with your doctor. \n \nInformation for injecting yourself \n \nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Lonquex under the skin. It is \nimportant that you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received special training \nfrom your doctor or nurse. If you are not sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any \nquestions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. \n \nHow Lonquex is used \nYou will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a \nsubcutaneous injection. \n \nEquipment that you need \nTo give yourself an injection into the tissue under the skin you will need: \n• a pre-filled syringe of Lonquex, \n• an alcohol wipe, \n• a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab, \n• a puncture-proof container (plastic container provided by the hospital or pharmacy) so you can \n\ndispose of used syringes safely. \n \nWhat you should do before your injection \n1. Take the medicine out of the refrigerator. \n2. Open the blister and take the pre-filled syringe out of the blister. Do not pick up the pre-filled \n\nsyringe by the plunger or needle cover. \n3. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed \n\nthe last day of the month shown. \n4. Check the appearance of Lonquex. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles \n\nin it or if it is cloudy, you must not use it. \n5. Do not shake Lonquex vigorously as this may affect its activity. \n6. For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room \n\ntemperature (not above 25°C) or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few \nminutes. Do not warm Lonquex in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave \nor in hot water). \n\n7. Do not remove the needle cover from the syringe until you are ready to inject. \n8. Find a comfortable, well-lit place. Put everything you need within easy reach (the Lonquex \n\npre-filled syringe, an alcohol wipe, a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab and the \npuncture-proof container). \n\n9. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \nHow to prepare for your injection \nBefore you give yourself a Lonquex injection, you must do the following: \n1. Hold the syringe and gently remove the cover from the needle without twisting. Pull straight as \n\nshown in pictures 1 and 2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n2. You may notice small air bubbles in the pre-filled syringe. If there are air bubbles present, \ngently tap the syringe with your fingers until the air bubbles rise to the top of the syringe. With \nthe syringe pointing upwards, expel all air from the syringe by pushing the plunger slowly \nupwards. \n\n3. You can now use the pre-filled syringe. \n \n\n1 2 \n \nWhere your injection should be given \nThe most suitable places to inject yourself are: \n• the top of your thighs, \n• the abdomen (see grey areas in picture 3) avoiding the skin directly surrounding the navel. \n \nIf someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back and side of your upper arms (see grey \nareas in pictures 4 and 5). \n \n\n3 \n \n\n4 5 \n \nHow you should inject yourself \n1. Disinfect the injection site on the skin by using an alcohol wipe and pinch the skin between your \n\nthumb and forefinger, without squeezing it (see picture 6). \n2. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your doctor or nurse. The angle between the \n\nsyringe and skin should not be too narrow (at least 45°, see picture 7). \n\n\n\n29 \n\n3. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood \nin the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place. \n\n4. Inject the liquid into the tissue slowly and evenly, always keeping your skin pinched. \n5. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle and let go of your skin. \n6. Press the injection site with a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab for several \n\nseconds. \n7. Only use each syringe for one injection. Do not use any Lonquex that is left in the syringe. \n \n\n6 7 \n \nRemember \nIf you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice. \n \nDisposing of used syringes \n• Do not put the cover back on used needles. \n• Put used syringes into the puncture-proof container and keep this container out of the sight and \n\nreach of children. \n• Dispose of the full puncture-proof container as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• Never put the syringes that you have used into your normal household rubbish bin. \n \nInformation for injecting yourself \n \nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Lonquex under the skin. It is \nimportant that you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received special training \nfrom your doctor or nurse. If you are not sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any \nquestions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. \n \nHow Lonquex is used \nYou will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin.

Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost serious side effects \n \n• Allergic reactions such as skin rash, raised itchy areas of skin and serious allergic reactions with \n\nweakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing and swelling of the face have been \nreported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If you think you are having this type \nof reaction, you must stop your Lonquex injection and get medical help immediately. \n\n• Increased spleen size has been reported uncommonly  and cases of splenic ruptures have been \nreported with other medicines similar to Lonquex. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. It is \nimportant to contact your doctor immediately if you experience pain in the upper left side of the \nabdomen or left shoulder pain since this may relate to a problem with your spleen. \n\n• Cough, fever and difficult or painful breathing can be signs of uncommon  serious pulmonary \nside effects, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which may be fatal. If \nyou have a fever or any of these symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n• It is important to contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms: \nswelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty \nbreathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These \nsymptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. \n\n\n\n33 \n\nThese could be symptoms of a condition reported with frequency not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data), called “capillary leak syndrome”, which causes blood to leak \nfrom the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. \n\n \nOther side effects \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• Musculoskeletal pains such as bone pain and pain in the joints, muscles, limbs, chest, neck or \n\nback. Tell your doctor if you experience severe musculoskeletal pain. \n• Nausea. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• Reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising. \n• Headache. \n• Skin reactions, such as redness or rash. \n• Low blood levels of potassium, which can cause muscle weakness, twitching or abnormal heart \n\nrhythm. \n• Chest pain. \n• Coughing up blood. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• Rise in white blood cells. \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain or hardening. \n• Some changes may occur in your blood, but these will be detected by routine blood tests. \n• Bleeding from the lung. \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n• Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the \n\nbody), see section 2. \n \nSide effects that have been seen with similar medicines, but not yet with Lonquex \n• Sickle cell crises in patients with sickle cell anaemia. \n• Plum-coloured raised painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with fever \n\n(Sweet’s syndrome). \n• Inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin. \n• Damage to the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis; see section 2 under \n\n“Warnings and precautions”). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.
