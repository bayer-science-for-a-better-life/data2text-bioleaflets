PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nWhite to off-white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nYondelis is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, after \nfailure of anthracyclines and ifosfamide, or who are unsuited to receive these agents. Efficacy data are \nbased mainly on liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma patients. \n \nYondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is indicated for the treatment of \npatients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nYondelis must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \nchemotherapy. Its use should be confined to qualified oncologists or other health professionals \nspecialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents. \n \nPosology \n \nFor the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, the recommended dose is 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area, \nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours with a three-week interval between cycles.  \n \nFor the treatment of ovarian cancer Yondelis is administered every three weeks as a 3-hour infusion at \na dose of 1.1 mg/m2, immediately after PLD 30 mg/m2. To minimize the risk of PLD infusion \nreactions, the initial dose is administered at a rate no greater than 1 mg/minute. If no infusion reaction \nis observed, subsequent PLD infusions may be administered over a 1-hour period (see also PLD \nSummary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] for specific administration advice). \n \nAll patients must receive corticosteroids e.g. 20 mg of dexamethasone intravenously 30 minutes prior \nto PLD (in combination therapy) or Yondelis (in monotherapy); not only as anti-emetic prophylaxis, \nbut also because it appears to provide hepatoprotective effects. Additional anti-emetics may be \nadministered as needed. \n \nThe following criteria are required to allow treatment with Yondelis: \n \n- Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1,500/mm3 \n- Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm3 \n- Bilirubin \u2264 upper limit of normal (ULN) \n- Alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 x ULN (consider hepatic isoenzymes 5-nucleotidase or gamma \n\nglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), if the elevation could be osseous in origin). \n- Albumin \u2265 25 g/l \n- Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2264 2.5 x ULN \n- Creatinine clearance \u2265 30 ml/min (monotherapy), serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl (\u2264 132.6 \u03bcmol/l) \n\nor creatinine clearance \u2265 60 ml/min (combination therapy) \n- Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) \u2264 2.5 x ULN \n- Haemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dl \n \nThe same criteria as above must be met prior to re-treatment. Otherwise treatment must be delayed for \nup to 3 weeks until the criteria are met. \n \nAdditional monitoring of haematological parameters bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, \naminotransferases and CPK should occur weekly during the first two cycles of therapy, and at least \nonce between treatments in subsequent cycles. \n \nThe same dose should be given for all cycles provided that no grade 3-4 toxicities are seen and that \nthe patient fulfils the re-treatment criteria. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nPrior to re-treatment, patients must fulfil the baseline criteria defined above. If any of the following \nevents occur at any time between cycles, the dose must be reduced one level, according to table 1 \nbelow, for subsequent cycles: \n \n- Neutropenia < 500/mm3 lasting for more than 5 days or associated with fever or infection \n- Thrombocytopenia < 25,000/mm3 \n- Increase of bilirubin > ULN and/or alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 x ULN  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n- Increase of aminotransferases (AST or ALT) > 2.5 x ULN (monotherapy) or > 5 x ULN \n(combination therapy), which has not recovered by day 21 \n\n- Any other grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue) \n \nOnce a dose has been reduced because of toxicity, dose escalation in the subsequent cycles is not \nrecommended. If any of these toxicities reappear in subsequent cycles in a patient exhibiting clinical \nbenefit, the dose may be further reduced (see below). Colony stimulating factors can be administered \nfor haematologic toxicity according to local standard practice. \n \nTable 1 Dose modification table for Yondelis (as single agent for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) or in \n\ncombination for ovarian cancer) and PLD \n \n\n Soft tissue sarcoma Ovarian cancer \n Yondelis Yondelis PLD \nStarting dose 1.5 mg/m2 1.1 mg/m2 30 mg/m2   \nFirst reduction 1.2 mg/m2 0.9 mg/m2  25 mg/m2   \nSecond reduction 1 mg/m2 0.75 mg/m2 20 mg/m2   \n \n\nSee the PLD SmPC for more detailed information on PLD dose adjustments. \n \nIn the event that further dose reductions are necessary, treatment discontinuation should be \nconsidered.  \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nIn clinical trials, there were no pre-defined limits to the number of cycles administered. Treatment \ncontinued whilst clinical benefit was noted. Yondelis has been administered for 6 or more cycles in \n29.5% and 52% of patients treated with the monotherapy and combination dose and schedule \nrespectively. The monotherapy and combination regimens have been used for up to 38 and 21 cycles \nrespectively. No cumulative toxicities have been observed in patients treated with multiple cycles. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nYondelis should not be used in children below 18 years with paediatric sarcomas because of efficacy \nconcerns (see 5.1 for results of paediatric sarcoma study). \n \nElderly \n \nNo specific studies in older people have been performed. Overall 20% of the 1,164 patients in the \nintegrated safety analysis of monotherapy clinical trials were over 65 years. Of the 333 patients with \novarian cancer who received trabectedin in combination with PLD, 24% were 65 years of age or older \nand 6% were over 75 years. No relevant differences in the safety profile were seen in this patient \npopulation. It seems that plasma clearance and distribution volume of trabectedin are not influenced \nby age. Therefore, dose adjustments based uniquely on age criteria are not routinely recommended. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nSpecial caution is advised and dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment \nsince systemic exposure to trabectedin is increased and the risk of hepatotoxicity might be increased. \nPatients with elevated serum bilirubin levels at baseline must not be treated with Yondelis. Liver \nfunction tests should be monitored during treatment with Yondelis as dose adjustments may be \nindicated (see Table 1 and section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nStudies including patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min for the \nmonotherapy, and < 60 ml/min for the combination regimen) have not been conducted and therefore \nYondelis must not be used in this patient population (see section 4.4). Considering the \npharmacokinetic characteristics of trabectedin (see section 5.2), no dose adjustments are warranted in \npatients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravenous administration through a central venous line is strongly recommended (see sections 4.4 \nand 6.6). \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to trabectedin or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- Concurrent serious or uncontrolled infection \n- Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n- Combination with yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.4) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPatients must meet specific criteria on hepatic function parameters to start treatment with Yondelis. \nSince the systemic exposure to trabectedin is on average approximately doubled (see section 5.2) due \nto hepatic impairment and therefore the risk of toxicities might be increased, patients with clinically \nrelevant liver diseases, such as active chronic hepatitis, must be closely monitored and the dose \nadjusted if needed. Patients with elevated serum bilirubin levels must not be treated with trabectedin \n(see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCreatinine clearance must be monitored prior to and during treatment. Yondelis monotherapy and \ncombination regimens must not be used in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min \nand < 60 ml/min respectively (see section 4.2). \n \nNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n \nGrades 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia associated with Yondelis therapy have been very \ncommonly reported. A full blood cell count including differential and platelet count must be \nperformed at baseline, weekly for the first two cycles and then once between cycles (see section 4.2). \nPatients who develop fever should promptly seek medical attention. If this occurs, active supportive \ntherapy should be started immediately. \n \nYondelis should not be administered to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less \nthan 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets count of less than 100,000 cells/mm3. If severe neutropenia \n(ANC < 500 cells/mm3) lasting more than 5 days or associated with fever or infection occurs, dose \nreduction is recommended (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nNausea and vomiting \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone must be administered to all \npatients (see section 4.2). \n \nRhabdomyolysis and severe CPK elevations (> 5 x ULN) \n \nTrabectedin must not be used in patients with CPK > 2.5 x ULN (see section 4.2). Rhabdomyolysis \nhas been uncommonly reported, usually in association with myelotoxicity, severe liver function test \nabnormalities and/or renal or multiorgan failure. Therefore, CPK should be closely monitored \nwhenever a patient may be experiencing any of these toxicities or muscle weakness or muscle pain. If \nrhabdomyolysis occurs, supportive measures such as parenteral hydration, urine alkalinisation and \ndialysis should be promptly established, as indicated. Treatment with Yondelis should be \ndiscontinued until the patient fully recovers.  \n \nCaution should be taken if medicinal products associated with rhabdomyolysis (e.g. statins), are \nadministered concomitantly with trabectedin, since the risk of rhabdomyolysis may be increased \n \nLiver Function Test (LFT) abnormalities \n \nReversible acute increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \nhave been reported in most patients. Yondelis must not be used in patients with elevated bilirubin. \nPatients with increases in AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase between cycles may necessitate dose \nadjustments (see section 4.2). \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nThe use of central venous access is strongly recommended (see section 4.2). Patients may develop a \npotentially severe injection site reaction when trabectedin is administered through a peripheral venous \nline. \n \nTrabectedin extravasation may cause tissue necrosis requiring debridement. There is no specific \nantidote for extravasation of trabectedin. Extravasation should be managed by local standard practice. \n \nAllergic Reactions  \n \nDuring postmarketing experience, hypersensitivity reactions with very rare occurrence of fatal \noutcome, have been reported in association with trabectedin administration either alone or in \ncombination with PLD (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac Dysfunction \n \nPatients should be monitored for cardiac-related adverse events or myocardial dysfunction. \n \nA thorough cardiac assessment including determination of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by \nechocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) should be conducted before initiation of \ntrabectedin and at 2 to 3-month intervals thereafter until trabectedin is discontinued. \n \nPatients with LVEF less than the lower limit of normal (LVEF < LLN), prior cumulative \nanthracycline dose of >300mg/m2, aged > 65 years, or a history of cardiovascular disease (especially \nin those with cardiac medication) may be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction at treatment with \ntrabectedin as monotherapy or in combination with doxorubicin. \n \nFor patients with Grade 3 or 4 cardiac adverse events indicative of cardiomyopathy or for patients \nwith a LVEF that decreases below the LLN (assessed as either an absolute decrease of LVEF of \n\u226515% or <LLN with an absolute decrease of \u22655%), trabectedin should be discontinued. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \nCapillary Leak Syndrome (CLS) \n \nCases of Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS) have been reported with trabectedin (including cases with \nfatal outcomes). If symptoms of possible CLS develop, such as unexplained oedema with or without \nhypotension, the treating physician should reassess serum albumin level. A rapid decline in serum \nalbumin level may be indicative of CLS. If a diagnosis of CLS is confirmed after exclusion of other \ncauses, the treating physician should discontinue trabectedin and initiate CLS treatment according to \ninstitutional guidelines (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nOthers \n \nCo-administration of Yondelis with potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP3A4 should be avoided (see \nsection 4.5). If this is not possible, close monitoring of toxicities are required and dose reductions of \ntrabectedin should be considered. \n \nCaution should be taken if medicinal products associated with hepatotoxicity are administered \nconcomitantly with trabectedin, since the risk of hepatotoxicity may be increased. \n \nConcomitant use of trabectedin with phenytoin may reduce phenytoin absorption leading to an \nexacerbation of convulsions. Combination of trabectedin with phenytoin or live attenuated vaccines is \nnot recommended and with yellow fever vaccine is specifically contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nThe concomitant use of trabectedin with alcohol must be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and 3 months \nthereafter, and immediately inform the treating physician if a pregnancy occurs (see section 5.3). \nMen in fertile age must use effective contraception during treatment and 5 months after treatment (see \nsection 4.6). \n \nThis medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially \n\u201cpotassium-free\u201d.  \n \nSee also PLD Summary of Product Characteristics for more detailed information on warnings and \nprecautions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other substances on trabectedin \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nSince trabectedin is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4, the concentrations of trabectedin in plasma are \nlikely to be increased in patients who are co-administered drugs that potently inhibit the activity of \nthis isoenzyme. Similarly, the co-administration of trabectedin with potent inducers of CPY3A4 may \nincrease the metabolic clearance of trabectedin. Two in vivo drug-drug interaction phase 1 studies \nhave confirmed trends toward increased and decreased trabectedin exposures when administered with \nketoconazole and rifampicin, respectively. \n \nWhen ketoconazole was co-administered with trabectedin, the plasma exposure of trabectedin was \nincreased by approximately 21% for Cmax and 66% for AUC, but no new safety concerns were \nidentified. Close monitoring of toxicities is required in patients receiving trabectedin in combination \nwith potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. oral ketoconazole, fluconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin or \naprepitant) and such combinations should be avoided if possible. If such combinations are needed, \nappropriate dose adjustments should be applied in the event of toxicities (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nWhen rifampicin was co-administered with trabectedin, it resulted in reduced plasma exposure of \ntrabectedin by approximately 22% for Cmax and 31% for AUC. Therefore, the concomitant use of \ntrabectedin with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenobarbital, Saint John\u2019s Wort) should \nbe avoided if possible (see section 4.4).  \n \nAlcohol consumption must be avoided during treatment with trabectedin due to the hepatotoxicity of \nthe medicinal product (see section 4.4). \n \nPreclinical data have demonstrated that trabectedin is a substrate to P-gp. Concomitant administration \nof inhibitors of P-gp, e.g. cyclosporine and verapamil, may alter trabectedin distribution and/or \nelimination. The relevance of this interaction e.g. central nervous system (CNS) toxicity has not been \nestablished. Caution should be taken in such situations.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nNo sufficient clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. However, based on its known \nmechanism of action, trabectedin may cause serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Trabectedin crossed the placenta when administered to pregnant rats. Trabectedin should \nnot be used during pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs during treatment, the patient must be informed of \nthe potential risk to the foetus (see section 5.3) and be monitored carefully. If trabectedin is used at \nthe end of pregnancy, potential adverse reactions should be monitored carefully in the newborns. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and 3 months \nthereafter, and immediately inform the treating physician if a pregnancy occurs (see section 5.3).  \n \nIf pregnancy occurs during treatment the possibility of genetic counselling should be considered. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether trabectedin is excreted in human milk. The excretion of trabectedin in milk \nhas not been studied in animals. Breast-feeding is contraindicated during treatment and 3 months \nthereafter (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nMen in fertile age must use effective contraception during treatment and 5 months after treatment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nTrabectedin can have genotoxic effects. Advice on conservation of ovules or sperm should be sought \nprior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Yondelis. \nGenetic counselling is also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of the ability to drive and to use machines have been performed. However, \nfatigue and/or asthenia have been reported in patients receiving trabectedin. Patients who experience \nany of these adverse reactions during therapy must not drive or operate machines. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nMost patients treated with Yondelis can be expected to have adverse reactions of any grade (91% in \nmonotherapy and 99% in combination therapy) and less than one third serious adverse reactions of \ngrade 3 or 4 severity (10% in monotherapy and 25% in combination therapy). The most common \nadverse reactions of any severity grade were neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, increase in AST/ALT, \nanaemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, anorexia and diarrhoea. \n \nFatal adverse reactions have occurred in 1.9% and 0.9% of patients treated with the monotherapy and \ncombination regimens respectively. They were often the result of a combination of events including \npancytopenia, febrile neutropenia, some of them with sepsis, hepatic involvement, renal or multiorgan \nfailure and rhabdomyolysis. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe following safety profile of Yondelis is based on adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, post-\nauthorisation safety studies and spontaneous reporting. \n \nThe table below displays the adverse reactions reported in patients with soft tissue sarcoma and \novarian cancer that were treated with Yondelis recommended regimen in each indication. Both \nadverse reactions and laboratory values have been used to provide frequencies.  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by System Organ Class and frequency. The frequencies are classified as \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).  \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery Common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nInfections and \nInfestations \n\nNeutropenic infection Sepsis Septic shock  \n\nBlood and \nLymphatic System \nDisorders \n\nNeutropenia \nThrombocytopenia \nAnaemia \nLeukopenia \n\nFebrile neutropenia   \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Hypersensitivity   \n\nMetabolism and \nNutrition Disorders \n\nDecreased appetite Dehydration \nHypokalaemia \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric \nDisorders \n\nInsomnia    \n\nNervous System \nDisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness \nDysgeusia \nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy \nSyncope* \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Palpitations* \nLeft ventricular dysfunction* \n\n  \n\nVascular Disorders  Hypotension \nFlushing \n\nCapillary leak \nsyndrome \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nThoracic and \nMediastinal \nDisorders \n\nDyspnoea \nCough \n\nPulmonary embolism* Pulmonary \noedema \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery Common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nAbdominal pain \nNausea \nVomiting \nConstipation \nDiarrhoea \nStomatitis \n\nDyspepsia \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \nDisorders \n\nAlanine aminotransferase \nincreased \nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased \nBlood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased \nBlood bilirubin increased \n\nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \n \n \n \n \n\n Hepatic \nfailure \n\nSkin and \nSubcutaneous \nTissue Disorders \n\nPalmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia \nsyndrome* \n\nRash \nAlopecia \nSkin hyperpigmentation* \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand Connective \nTissue Disorders \n\nArthralgia \nBack pain \nBlood creatine \nphosphokinase increased \n\nMyalgia \n \n\nRhabdomyolysis  \n\nGeneral Disorders \nand Administration \nSite Conditions \n\nFatigue \nPyrexia \nOedema \nMucosal inflammation* \n\nInjection site reactions \n \n\n \n\n \n\nExtravasation \nSoft tissue \nnecrosis \n\n \n\nInvestigations Blood creatinine increased \nBlood albumin decreased \n\nWeight decreased   \n\n \n*   Adverse drug reaction only for Ovarian cancer \n \nIn the Yondelis+PLD arm, non-white (mainly Asian) patients had a higher incidence than white \npatients in grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (96% versus 87%), and serious adverse reactions \n(44% versus 23% all grades). The differences were mainly observed in relation with neutropenia \n(93% versus 66%), anaemia (37% versus 14%) and thrombocytopenia (41% versus 19%). However, \nthe incidences of clinical complications related to haematological toxicity such as severe infections or \nbleeding, or those leading to death or treatment termination, were similar in both subpopulations. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMost frequent adverse reactions \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nNeutropenia:  \nNeutropenia is the most common haematological toxicity. It followed a predictable pattern of rapid \nonset and reversibility, and was rarely associated with fever or infection. Neutrophil nadirs occurred \nat a median of 15 days and recovered within a week. The analysis per cycle performed in patients \ntreated with the monotherapy regimen showed neutropenia of grade 3 and 4 in approximately 19% \nand 8% of cycles respectively. In this population febrile neutropenia occurred in 2% of patients and in \n< 1% of cycles. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \nThrombocytopenia: \nBleeding events associated to thrombocytopenia occurred in < 1% of patients treated with the \nmonotherapy regimen. The analysis per cycle performed in these patients showed thrombocytopenia \nof grade 3 and 4 in approximately 3% and < 1% of cycles respectively.  \n \nAnaemia:  \nAnaemia occurred in 93% and 94% of patients treated with the monotherapy and combination \nregimens respectively. The percentages of patients anaemic at baseline were 46% and 35% \nrespectively. The analysis per cycle performed in patients treated with the monotherapy regimen \nshowed anaemia of grade 3 and 4 in approximately 3% and 1% of cycles respectively.  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nAST/ALT increases:  \nThe median time to reach the peak values was 5 days for both AST and ALT. Most of the values had \ndecreased to grade 1 or resolved by day 14-15 (see section 4.4). The analysis per cycle performed in \npatients treated with the monotherapy regimen showed grade 3 elevations of AST and ALT in 12% \nand 20% of cycles respectively. Grade 4 elevations of AST and ALT occurred in 1% and 2% of cycles \nrespectively. Most transaminase elevations improved to grade 1 or to pre-retreatment levels within 15 \ndays, and less than 2% of cycles had recovering times longer than 25 days. ALT and AST increases \ndid not follow a cumulative pattern but showed a tendency towards less severe elevations over time.  \n \nHyperbilirubinemia:  \nBilirubin peaks approximately a week after onset and resolves approximately two weeks after onset. \n \nLiver function tests predicting severe toxicity (meeting Hy\u00b4s law) and clinical manifestations of \nsevere hepatic injury were uncommon with a lower than 1% incidence of individual signs and \nsymptoms including jaundice, hepatomegaly or liver pain. Mortality in the presence of hepatic injury \noccurred in less than 1% of patients in both regimens. \n \nOther adverse reactions \n \nHepatic failure: Rare cases of hepatic failure (including cases with fatal outcomes) have been \nreported in patients with serious underlying medical conditions treated with trabectedin, both in \nclinical trials and in post marketing setting. Some potential risk factors that may have contributed to \nincreased trabectedin toxicity observed in these cases were dose management inconsistent with \nrecommended guidelines, potential CYP3A4 interaction due to multiple competing CYP3A4 \nsubstrates or CYP3A4 inhibitors, or lack of dexamethasone prophylaxis. \n \nCapillary Leak Syndrome (CLS): Cases of Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS) have been reported with \ntrabectedin (including cases with fatal outcomes) (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited data on the effects of trabectedin overdose. The major anticipated toxicities are \ngastrointestinal, bone marrow suppression and hepatic toxicity. There is no specific antidote for \ntrabectedin currently available. In the event of an overdose, patients should be closely monitored and \nsymptomatic supportive care measures instituted as required.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agent, ATC code: L01CX01. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTrabectedin binds to the minor groove of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), bending the helix to the \nmajor groove. This binding to DNA triggers a cascade of events affecting several transcription \nfactors, DNA binding proteins, and DNA repair pathways, resulting in perturbation of the cell cycle.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nTrabectedin has been shown to exert antiproliferative in vitro and in vivo activity against a range of \nhuman tumour cell lines and experimental tumours, including malignancies such as sarcoma, breast, \nnon-small cell lung, ovarian and melanoma. \n \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) investigations \n \nIn a placebo-controlled QT/QTc study, trabectedin did not prolong the QTc interval in patients with \nadvanced solid malignancies. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of trabectedin in soft tissue sarcoma is based in a randomised trial in patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic lipo- or leiomyosarcoma, whose disease had progressed or \nrelapsed after treatment with at least anthracyclines and ifosfamide. In this trial trabectedin was \nadministered either at 1.5 mg/m2 as a 24-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks or at 0.58 mg/m2 \nweekly as a 3-hour intravenous infusion for 3-weeks of a 4-week cycle. The protocol specified final \ntime to progression (TTP) analysis showed a 26.6% reduction in the relative risk of progression for \npatients treated in the 24-h q3wk group [Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.734, Confidence Interval \n(CI): 0.554-0.974]. Median TTP values were 3.7 months (CI: 2.1-5.4 m) in the 24-h q3wk group and \n2.3 months (CI: 2.0-3.5 m) in the 3-h qwk group (p=0.0302). No significant differences were detected \nin overall survival (OS). Median OS with the 24-h q3wk regimen was 13.9 months (CI: 12.5-18.6) and \n60.2% of patients were alive at 1 year (CI: 52.0-68.5%). \n \nAdditional efficacy data are available from 3 single-arm Phase II trials with similar populations \ntreated with the same regimen. These trials evaluated a total of 100 patients with lipo- and \nleiomyosarcoma and 83 patients with other types of sarcoma.  \n \nResults from an expanded access program for patients with STS (study ET743-SAR- 3002) show that \namong the 903 subjects assessed for OS, the median survival time was 11.9 months (95% CI: 11.2, \n13.8). The median survival by histology tumour type was 16.2 months [95% CI: 14.1, 19.5] for \nsubjects with leiomyosarcomas and liposarcomas and 8.4 months [95% CI: 7.1, 10.7] for subjects \nwith other types of sarcomas. The median survival for subjects with liposarcoma was 18.1 months \n[95% CI: 15.0, 26.4] and for subjects with leiomyosarcoma 16.2 months [95% CI: 11.7, 24.3]. \n \nAdditional efficacy data are available from a randomized active-controlled phase III study of \ntrabectedin vs. dacarbazine (Study ET743-SAR-3007), in patients treated for unresectable or \nmetastatic lipo- or leiomyosarcoma who have been previously treated with at least an anthracycline \nand ifosfamide containing regimen, or an anthracycline containing regimen and one additional \ncytotoxic chemotherapy regimen. Patients in the trabectedin arm were required to receive \ndexamethasone 20 mg intravenous injection prior to each trabectedin infusion. Overall, 384 patients \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nwere randomized to the trabectedin group [1.5 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks (q3wk 24-h)] and \n193 patients to the dacarbazine group (1 g/m2 once every 3 weeks). The median patient age was \n56 years (range 17 to 81), 30% were male, 77% Caucasian, 12% African American and 4% Asian. \nPatients in the trabectedin and dacarbazine arms received a median of 4 and 2 cycles respectively. The \nprimary efficacy endpoint of the study was OS, which included 381 death events (66% of all \nrandomized patients): 258 (67.2%) deaths in the trabectedin group and 123 (63.7%) deaths in the \ndacarbazine group (HR 0.927 [95% CI: 0.748, 1.150; p=0.4920]). The final analysis showed no \nsignificant difference with a median survival follow-up of 21.2 months resulted in a median of 13.7 \nmonths (95% CI: 12.2, 16.0) for the trabectedin arm and 13.1 months [95% CI: 9.1, 16.2] for the \ndacarbazine arm.

The study assessed the efficacy and safety of \ntrabectedin vs. best supportive care (BSC) as second-line or later therapy for patients with advanced \nTRS unresponsive or intolerant to standard chemotherapy regimen. The patients received the \ntrabectedin dose of 1.2 mg/m2 recommended for Japanese patients [1.2 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks \n(q3wk 24-h)]. A total of 76 Japanese patients were enrolled in the study, among which 73 patients \nwere included in the final analysis set. The study primary endpoint was PFS, that showed a \nstatistically significant improvement in favour of trabectedin over BSC [HR=0.07; 95% CI: 0.03-0.16; \np<0.0001], with a median PFS in the trabectedin group of 5.6 months [95% CI: 4.1-7.5] and in the \nBSC group of 0.9 months [95% CI: 0.7-1.0]. The secondary endpoints included objective response \nanalysed using the RECIST and Choi criteria. Using the RECIST criteria the ORR among patients \ntreated with trabectedin was 3 (8.1%; 95% CI: 1.7.21.9%) and 0 (0%, 95% CI: 0.0-9.7%) among \npatients treated with best supportive care, while the CBR was 24 (64.9%, 95% CI: 47.5-79.9%) versus \n0 (0%, 95% CI: 0.0-9.7%), respectively. Using the Choi criteria the ORR among patients treated with \ntrabectedin was 4 (10.8%; 95% CI: 3.0-25.4%) and 0 (0%, 95% CI: 0.0-9.7%) among patients treated \nwith best supportive care, while the CBR was 7 (18.9%, 95% CI: 8.0-35.2%) versus 0 (0%, 95% CI: \n0.0-9.7%), respectively. \n \nThe efficacy of Yondelis/PLD combination in relapsed ovarian cancer is based on ET743-OVA-301, a \nrandomized phase 3 study of 672 patients who received either trabectedin (1.1 mg/m2) and PLD \n(30 mg/m2) every 3 weeks or PLD (50 mg/m2) every 4 weeks. The primary analysis of progression \nfree survival (PFS) was performed in 645 patients with measurable disease and assessed by \nindependent radiology review. Treatment with the combination arm resulted in a 21% risk reduction \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nfor disease progression compared to PLD alone (HR=0.79, CI: 0.65-0.96, p=0.0190). Secondary \nanalyses of PFS and response rate also favoured the combination arm.

In patients with PFI \u2265 6 months (65% in Yondelis+PLD and \n63% in PLD arm), median PFS was 9.7 months in the Yondelis+PLD arm compared with 7.2 months \nin the PLD monotherapy arm (HR=0.66, CI: 0.52-0.85). \n  \nIn the final analysis, the effect of the Yondelis+PLD combination vs. PLD alone on overall survival \nwas more pronounced in patients with PFI \u2265 6 months (platinum-sensitive population: 27.0 vs. \n24.1 months, HR=0.83, CI: 0.67-1.04) than in those with PFI < 6 months (platinum-resistant \npopulation: 14.2 vs. 12.4 months, HR=0.92, CI: 0. 70-1.21). \n \nThe benefit in OS with Yondelis plus PLD was not due to the effect of subsequent therapies, which \nwere well balanced between the two treatment arms. \n \nIn the multivariate analyses including PFI, treatment effect on overall survival was statistically \nsignificant favouring the Yondelis+PLD combination over PLD alone (all randomised: p=0.0285; \nplatinum-sensitive population: p=0.0319). \n \nNo data are available comparing Yondelis+PLD to a platinum-based regimen in platinum-sensitive \npatients. \n \nNo statistically significant differences were found between treatment arms in global measures of \nQuality of Life. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nIn SAR-2005 phase I-II study, a total of 50 paediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing \nsarcoma or non rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma were enrolled. Eight patients were treated \nwith a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 and 42 with 1.5 mg/m2. Trabectedin was administered as a 24-hour \nintravenous infusion every 21 days. Forty patients were fully evaluable for response.  One partial \nresponse (PR) centrally confirmed was observed: overall RR: 2.5% CI95% (0.1%-13.2%). The PR \ncorresponded to a patient with an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Duration of the response was 6.5 \nmonths No responses were observed for Ewing sarcoma and NRSTS, [RR: 0% CI95% (0%-30.9%)]. \nThree patients achieved stable disease (one with rhabdomyosarcoma after 15 cycles, one with spindle \ncell sarcoma after 2 cycles, and one with Ewing sarcoma after 4 cycles.  \n \nAdverse reactions, included reversible elevation of liver enzymes and haematological events; in \naddition, fever, infection, dehydration and thrombosis/embolism were also reported.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \n \nSystemic exposure after intravenous administration as a constant rate infusion is dose proportional at \ndoses up to and including 1.8 mg/m2. Trabectedin pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a \nmultiple-compartment disposition model. \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, trabectedin demonstrates a high apparent volume of \ndistribution, consistent with extensive tissue and plasma protein binding (94 to 98% of trabectedin in \nplasma is protein bound). The distribution volume at steady state of trabectedin in human subjects \nexceeds 5,000 l. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nCytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 isozyme responsible for the oxidative \nmetabolism of trabectedin at clinically relevant concentrations. Other P450 enzymes may contribute \nto metabolism. Trabectedin does not induce or inhibit major cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nElimination \n \nRenal elimination of unchanged trabectedin in humans is low (less than 1%). The terminal half-life is \nlong (population value of the terminal elimination phase: 180-hr). After a dose of radiolabelled \ntrabectedin administered to cancer patients, faecal mean (SD) recovery of total radioactivity is \n58% (17%), and urinary mean (SD) recovery is 5.8% (1.73%). Based on the population estimate for \nplasma clearance of trabectedin (30.9 l/h) and blood/plasma ratio (0.89), the clearance of trabectedin \nin whole blood is approximately 35 l/h. This value is approximately one-half the rate of human \nhepatic blood flow. Thus the trabectedin extraction ratio can be considered moderate. The \ninter-patient variability of the population estimate for plasma clearance of trabectedin was 49% and \nintra-patient variability was 28%. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that when administered in combination with PLD, the \nplasma clearance of trabectedin was decreased by 31%; the plasma pharmacokinetics of PLD were \nnot influenced by the concomitant administration of trabectedin. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the plasma clearance of trabectedin is not \ninfluenced by age (range 19-83 years), gender, total body weight (range: 36 to 148 kg) or body surface \narea (range: 0.9 to 2.8 m2). A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that plasma trabectedin \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nconcentrations observed in the Japanese population at dose level 1.2 mg/m2 were equivalent to those \nobtained in the non-Japanese western population at 1.5 mg/m\u00b2. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThere is no relevant influence of renal function measured by creatinine clearance on trabectedin \npharmacokinetics within the range of values (\u2265 30.3 ml/min) present in the patients included in the \nclinical studies. No data are available in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 30.3 ml/min. \nThe low recovery (< 9% in all studied patients) of total radioactivity in the urine after a single dose of \n14C-labelled trabectedin indicates that renal impairment has little influence on the elimination of \ntrabectedin or its metabolites. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin was assessed in 15 cancer \npatients at doses ranging from 0.58 to 1.3 mg/m2 administered as 3-hour infusion. The geometric \nmean dose normalized trabectedin exposure (AUC) increased by 97% (90% CI: 20%, 222%) in 6 \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (increased serum bilirubin levels from 1.5 to 3 x ULN and \nincrease of aminotransferases (AST or ALT) < 8 x ULN) following administration of a single \ntrabectedin dose of 0.58 mg/m2 (n=3) or 0.9 mg/m2 (n=3) compared to 9 patients with normal liver \nfunction following administration of a single trabectedin dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data indicate that trabectedin has limited effect on the cardiovascular, respiratory and \ncentral nervous system at exposures below the therapeutic clinical range, in terms of AUC. \n \nThe effects of trabectedin on cardiovascular and respiratory function have been investigated in vivo \n(anesthetised Cynomolgus monkeys). A 1 hour infusion schedule was selected to attain maximum \nplasma levels (Cmax values) in the range of those observed in the clinic. The plasma trabectedin levels \nattained were 10.6 \u00b1 5.4 (Cmax), higher than those reached in patients after infusion of 1,500 \u00b5g/m2 for \n24 (Cmax of 1.8 \u00b1 1.1 ng/ml) and similar to those reached after administration of the same dose by \n3 hour infusion (Cmax of 10.8 \u00b1 3.7 ng/ml). \n \nMyelosupression and hepatoxicity were identified as the primary toxicity for trabectedin. Findings \nobserved included haematopoietic toxicity (severe leukopenia, anaemia, and lymphoid and bone \nmarrow depletion) as well as increases in liver function tests, hepatocellular degeneration, intestinal \nepithelial necrosis, and severe local reactions at the injection site. Renal toxicological findings were \ndetected in multi-cycle toxicity studies conducted in monkeys. These findings were secondary to \nsevere local reaction at the administration site, and therefore uncertainly attributable to trabectedin; \nhowever, caution must be guaranteed in the interpretation of these renal findings, and \ntreatment-related toxicity cannot be excluded.  \n \nTrabectedin is genotoxic both in vitro and in vivo. Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been \nperformed. \n \nFertility studies with trabectedin were not performed but limited histopathological changes were \nobserved in the gonads in the repeat dose toxicity studies. Considering the nature of the compound \n(cytotoxic and mutagenic), it is likely to affect the reproductive capacity. \n \nPlacental transfer of trabectedin and fetal exposure to trabectedin were observed in a study in \npregnant rats that received a single i.v. 14C-trabectedin dose at 0.061 mg/kg. Maximum fetal tissue \nradioactivity concentration was similar to that in maternal plasma or blood. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n \n1. What Yondelis is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Yondelis \n3. How to use Yondelis \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Yondelis \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Yondelis is and what it is used for \n \nYondelis contains the active substance trabectedin. Yondelis is an anti-cancer medicine that works by \npreventing the tumour cells from multiplying. \n \nYondelis is used for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, when previous \nmedicines have been unsuccessful or the patients are unsuited to receive them. Soft tissue sarcoma is \na malignant disease that starts somewhere in the soft tissues, such as the muscles, fat or other tissues \n(for example cartilages or vessels). \n \nYondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD: another anti-cancer medicine) \nis used for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer that has come back after at least 1 previous \ntherapy and are not resistant to anti-cancer medicines containing platinum compounds. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Yondelis \n \nDo not use Yondelis \n \n- if you are allergic to trabectedin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have any serious infections. \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n- if you will receive yellow fever vaccine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Yondelis  \n \nYondelis or its combination with PLD must not be used if you have severe liver, kidney or cardiac \ndamage.  \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nTell your doctor if you know or suspect that you have any of the following before starting the \ntreatment with Yondelis: \n \n\u2022 Liver or kidney problems. \n\n  \n\u2022 Cardiac problems or a history of cardiac problems. \n\n \n\u2022 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) under the lower limit of normal. \n\n \n\u2022 Received high anthracycline dose treatment in the past. \n \nYou should seek medical attention immediately if any of the following conditions appear: \n \n\u2022 If you develop a fever as Yondelis may cause side-effects affecting your blood and liver. \n \n\u2022 If you still feel sick, vomit or are unable to drink fluids and therefore pass less urine despite \n\nbeing given anti-sickness medicines. \n \n\u2022 If you experience severe muscle pain or weakness as it could be a sign of damage to your \n\nmuscles (rhabdomyolysis; see section 4). \n \n\u2022 If you notice that Yondelis infusion leaks out of your vein while you are being given it. It could \n\nlead to damage and death of your tissue cells around the injection site (tissue necrosis, see also \nsection 4) which may require surgery. \n\n \n\u2022 If you have an allergic reaction (hypersensitivity). In this case you may experience one or more \n\nof the following signs: fever, difficulty in breathing, redness or flushing of the skin or a rash, \nfeeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting; see section 4). \n \n\n\u2022 If you notice unexplained partial or general swelling (oedema), with possible lightheadedness, \ndizziness or thirst (low blood pressure). It could be a sign of a condition (capillary leak \nsyndrome) that can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in your tissues, and requires urgent \nmedical evaluation by your doctor. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents  \n \nYondelis should not be used in children below 18 years of age with paediatric sarcomas. \n \nOther medicines and Yondelis \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYou must not use Yondelis if you will receive yellow fever vaccine and it is not recommended that \nyou use Yondelis if you will receive a vaccine containing live virus particles. The effect of medicines \ncontaining phenytoin (for epilepsy) may be decreased if given together with Yondelis and this is \ntherefore not recommended.  \n \nIf you use any of the following medicines during your treatment with Yondelis, you need to be closely \nmonitored as the effects of Yondelis are: \n \n\u2022 decreased (examples are medicines containing rifampicin (for bacterial infections), phenobarbital \n\n(for epilepsy) or St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, an herbal medicine for depression)) or  \n \n\u2022 increased (examples are medicines containing ketoconazole or fluconazole (for fungal \n\ninfections), ritonavir (for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), clarithromycin (for \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nbacterial infections), aprepitant (to prevent nausea and vomiting), ciclosporin (inhibit the \ndefensive system of the body) or verapamil (for high blood pressure and heart conditions)).  \n\n \nThus the use of any of these medicines together with Yondelis should be avoided, if possible.  \n \nIf you are given Yondelis or the combination Yondelis+PLD together with a medicine that might \ncause damage to the liver or to the muscles (rhabdomyolysis), you may need to be closely monitored, \nas there could be an increased risk of liver or muscle damage. Medicines containing statins (for \nlowering cholesterol levels and preventing cardiovascular disease) is an example of medicines that \nmay cause muscle damage. \n \nYondelis with alcohol \n \nAlcohol consumption must be avoided during treatment with Yondelis as this may harm the liver. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nPregnancy \n \nYondelis should not be used during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are \nplanning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.  \n \nAdequate contraceptive precautions must be used by women of childbearing potential when receiving \nYondelis and for 3 months following the end of treatment.  \n \nIf a pregnancy should occur you must tell your doctor immediately and genetic counselling is \nrecommended since Yondelis can cause genetic damage. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nYondelis must not be given to patients who are breast-feeding. Therefore you must stop \nbreast-feeding before you start your treatment and you must not begin breast-feeding again until your \ndoctor has confirmed that it is safe to do so. \n \nFertility \n \nAdequate contraceptive precautions must be used by men in fertile age when receiving Yondelis and \nfor 5 months following the end of treatment. \n \nPatients should seek advice on ovules or sperm conservation prior to treatment because of the risk of \nirreversible infertility due to therapy with Yondelis. \n \nGenetic counselling is also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nDuring your treatment with Yondelis you may feel tired and experience a loss of strength. Do not \ndrive or use any tools or machines if you are experiencing any of these side effects. \n \nYondelis contains potassium \n \nThis medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, and can therefore be considered \nas essentially \u201cpotassium-free\u201d. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n3. How to use Yondelis \n \nYondelis is given to you under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of chemotherapy. \nIts use should be confined to qualified oncologists or other health professionals specialised in the \nadministration of cytotoxic medicines. \n \nFor the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, the usual dose is 1.5 mg/m2 of body surface area. During the \ntreatment period, your doctor will carefully monitor you and decide the most appropriate dosage of \nYondelis to give to you. The recommended dose in Japanese patients is lower than the usual dose for \nall other races, and is 1.2 mg/m2 of body surface area. \n \nFor the treatment of ovarian cancer, the usual dose is 1.1 mg/m2 body surface area after the \nadministration of 30 mg/m2 body surface area of PLD. \n \nBefore Yondelis is given to you, it is reconstituted and diluted for intravenous use. Every time you are \ngiven Yondelis for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, it will take about 24 hours for all of the \nsolution to enter your blood. It will take 3 hours for the treatment of ovarian cancer. \n \nIn order to avoid irritation at the site of injection it is recommended that Yondelis is given to you \nthrough a central venous line.  \n \nYou will be given a medicine before and as needed during the treatment with Yondelis in order to \nprotect your liver and to reduce the risk of side effects such as feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting.  \n \nThe infusion is given to you every 3 weeks, although occasionally your doctor may recommend dose \ndelays to ensure that you receive the most appropriate dose of Yondelis. \n \nThe length of your whole treatment period will depend on your progress and how well you feel. Your \ndoctor will tell you how long your treatment lasts. If you have any further questions on the use of this \nmedicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine or its combination with PLD can cause side effects, although not \neverybody gets them. \n \nIf you are not sure what the side effects below are, you should ask your doctor to explain them to you \nin more detail. \n \nSerious side effects caused by the treatment with Yondelis: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n \n\u2022 You could have increased levels of the yellow pigment bilirubin in the blood which might cause \n\njaundice (a yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes and eyes). \n \n\u2022 Your doctor will order regular blood tests to detect any abnormalities in the blood. \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n \n\u2022 You may also have blood infections (sepsis) if your immune system is greatly compromised. If \n\nyou have fever you should seek medical attention immediately. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n\u2022 You could also feel pain in your muscles (myalgia). There could also be damage to your nerves \nwhich may result in muscle pain, weakness and numbness. You could experience general \nswelling or swelling of the limbs and a sensation of creeping on the skin. \n\n \n\u2022 You may have a reaction at the site of injection. Yondelis infusion may leak out of your vein \n\nwhile you are being given it, leading to damage and death of your tissue cells around the \ninjection site (tissue necrosis, see also section 2 \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d) which may \nrequire surgery. \n\n \n\u2022 You could have an allergic reaction. In this case you may experience fever, difficulty in \n\nbreathing, redness or flushing of the skin or a rash, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick \n(vomiting). \n\n \n\u2022 When Yondelis is used in combination with PLD, you may have syncope also called fainting. \n\nFurthermore, you could feel like your heart is beating too hard or too fast in your chest \n(palpitations), have a weakness in the ventricles, the heart's major pumping chambers (left \nventricular dysfunction), or a sudden blockage in a lung artery (pulmonary embolism).  \n\n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\n \n\u2022 You may feel severe muscle aches and pain, stiffness and muscle weakness. You also may \n\nexperience a darkening of the urine colour. All the previously described, could be a sign of \ndamage to your muscles (rhabdomyolysis). \n  \n\n\u2022 Your doctor may require blood tests in certain situations in order to avoid that you develop \nmuscle damage (rhabdomyolysis). In very severe cases this could lead to kidney failure. If you \nexperience severe muscle pain or weakness, you should seek medical attention immediately. \n\n \n\u2022 You may experience difficulty in breathing, irregular heartbeat, decreased urine output, abrupt \n\nchange in mental status, areas of mottled skin, extremely low blood pressure associated with \nabnormal laboratory test results (decrease in platelet count). If you get any of the above \nsymptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. \n \n\n\u2022 You may experience an abnormal build-up of fluid in the lungs, which leads to swelling \n(pulmonary oedema). \n \n\n\u2022 You may notice unexplained partial or general swelling (oedema), with possible \nlightheadedness, dizziness or thirst (low blood pressure). It could be a sign of a condition \n(capillary leak syndrome) that can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in your tissues. If you \nget the above symptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. \n\n \n\u2022 You may notice that Yondelis infusion leaks out of your vein (extravasation) while you are \n\nbeing given it. Then you will notice some redness, swelling, itchiness and discomfort at the \ninjection site. If you get any of these symptoms or signs, tell your nurse or doctor \nimmediately.  \n\n \nIt could lead to damage and death of your tissue cells around the injection site (tissue necrosis) \nwhich may require surgery. \n \nSome of the symptoms or signs of extravasation may not be visible until several hours after it \noccurred. There may be blistering, peeling and darkening of the skin over the site. It is possible \nfor it to take a few days before the full extent of tissue damage is visible. If you get any of the \nprevious described symptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n \n\u2022 You may experience yellowing of your skin and eyeballs (jaundice), pain in the upper right area \n\nof your abdomen, nausea, vomiting, a general sense of not feeling well, difficulty in \nconcentrating, disorientation or confusion, sleepiness. These signs could be indicative of the \ninability of the liver to perform its normal function. If you get any of the previous described \nsymptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. \n\n \nOther less serious side effects: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n \n\u2022 You may: \n\n\u2022 feel tired \n\u2022 feel difficulty breathing and coughing \n\u2022 feel pain in your back and joints \n\u2022 feel an excess of fluid in the body (oedema) \n\u2022 bruise more easily \n\u2022 have nose bleeds \n\u2022 be more prone to infections. An infection could also give you a raised temperature \n\n(fever).  \n If you develop any of these symptoms you should seek medical attention immediately.  \n \n\u2022 You may present some digestive symptoms such as loss of appetite, sick (nausea) or vomit, pain \n\nin the abdomen, diarrhoea or constipation. If you still feel sick, vomit or are unable to drink \nfluids and therefore pass less urine, despite being given anti-sickness medicine, you should \nimmediately seek medical help. \n\n \n\u2022 You may experience headache and sleeping problems. \n \n\u2022 You could have mucosal inflammation as a swelling redness of the inside of the mouth leading \n\nto painful ulcers and mouth sores inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis), or as an inflammation \nof the gastrointestinal tract when Yondelis is used with PLD. \n\n \n\u2022 Patients receiving Yondelis plus PLD for ovarian cancer may also have the hand and foot \n\nsyndrome. It may present as red skin of the palms, fingers, and soles of the feet that later may \nbecome swollen and violaceous. The lesions may either dry out and desquamate, or blister with \nulceration. \n\n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n \n\u2022 You may experience, loss of water from the body, weight loss, digestive discomfort and a \n\nchange in your sense of taste. \n \n\u2022 You may lose hair (alopecia). \n \n\u2022 You could also experience dizziness, low blood pressure and flushing or skin rash. \n\n \n\u2022 Higher skin pigmentation could occur in patients receiving Yondelis with PLD for ovarian \n\ncancer. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5.

Accidental contact with the skin, eyes or mucous membranes \nmust be treated immediately with copious amounts of water. You should not work with this medicine \nif you are pregnant. \n \nPreparation for intravenous infusion \n \nYondelis must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to infusion (see also section 3). Appropriate \naseptic techniques must be used. \n \nYondelis must not be administered as a mixture with other medicines in the same infusion apart from \nthe diluent. No incompatibilities have been observed between Yondelis and type I glass bottles, \npolyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) bags and tubing, polyisoprene reservoirs and titanium \nimplantable vascular access systems. \n \nWhen Yondelis is used in combination with PLD, the intravenous line should be flushed well with \n50 mg/ml (5%) glucose solution for infusion after administration of PLD and before administration of \nYondelis. The use of any diluent other than 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose solution for infusion may cause \nprecipitation of PLD. (See also PLD Summary of Product Characteristics for specific handling \ninstructions). \n \nInstructions for reconstitution \n \nYondelis 0.25 mg: Inject 5 ml of sterile water for injections into the vial. \n \nYondelis 1 mg: Inject 20 ml of sterile water for injections into the vial.  \n \nA syringe is used to inject the correct amount of sterile water for injections into the vial. Shake the \nvial until complete dissolution. The reconstituted solution results in a clear, colourless or slightly \nyellowish solution, essentially free of visible particles. \n \nThis reconstituted solution contains 0.05 mg/ml of trabectedin. It requires further dilution and is for \nsingle-use only. \n \nInstructions for dilution \n \nDilute the reconstituted solution with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion or \nglucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for infusion. Calculate the required volume as follows: \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\nVolume (ml) = BSA (m2) x individual dose (mg/m2) \n    0.05 mg/ml \n \nBSA = Body Surface Area \n \nWithdraw the appropriate amount of reconstituted solution from the vial. If intravenous \nadministration is to be made via a central venous line, add the reconstituted solution to an infusion \nbag containing \u2265 50 ml of diluent (sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose \n50 mg/ml (5%) solution for infusion), the concentration of trabectedin in the infusion solution \nbeing \u2264 0.030 mg/ml. \n \nIf central venous access is not feasible and a peripheral venous line has to be used, add the \nreconstituted solution to an infusion bag containing \u2265 1,000 ml of diluent (sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for infusion). \n \nInspect the parenteral solution visually for particles prior to intravenous administration. Once the \ninfusion is prepared, it should be administered immediately. \n \nIn-use stability of the solutions \n \nReconstituted solution \nAfter reconstitution, chemical and physical stability has been demonstrated for 30 hours up to 25\u00baC.  \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution should be diluted and used \nimmediately. If not diluted and used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use of \nthe reconstituted solution are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than \n24 hours at 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC, unless reconstitution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic \nconditions. \n \nDiluted solution \nAfter dilution, chemical and physical stability has been demonstrated for 30 hours up to 25\u00baC.  \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

you need to know before you are given yondelis", "Section_Content": "do not use yondelis - if you are allergic to trabectedin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you have any serious infections. - if you are breast-feeding. - if you will receive yellow fever vaccine. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before using yondelis yondelis or its combination with pld must not be used if you have severe liver, kidney or cardiac damage. tell your doctor if you know or suspect that you have any of the following before starting the treatment with yondelis: liver or kidney problems. cardiac problems or a history of cardiac problems. left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) under the lower limit of normal. received high anthracycline dose treatment in the past. you should seek medical attention immediately if any of the following conditions appear: if you develop a fever as yondelis may cause side-effects affecting your blood and liver. if you still feel sick, vomit or are unable to drink fluids and therefore pass less urine despite being given anti-sickness medicines. if you experience severe muscle pain or weakness as it could be a sign of damage to your muscles (rhabdomyolysis; see section 4). if you notice that yondelis infusion leaks out of your vein while you are being given it. it could lead to damage and death of your tissue cells around the injection site (tissue necrosis, see also section 4) which may require surgery. if you have an allergic reaction (hypersensitivity). in this case you may experience one or more of the following signs: fever, difficulty in breathing, redness or flushing of the skin or a rash, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting; see section 4). if you notice unexplained partial or general swelling (oedema), with possible lightheadedness, dizziness or thirst (low blood pressure). it could be a sign of a condition (capillary leak syndrome) that can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in your tissues, and requires urgent medical evaluation by your doctor. children and adolescents yondelis should not be used in children below 18 years of age with paediatric sarcomas. other medicines and yondelis tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. you must not use yondelis if you will receive yellow fever vaccine and it is not recommended that you use yondelis if you will receive a vaccine containing live virus particles. the effect of medicines containing phenytoin (for epilepsy) may be decreased if given together with yondelis and this is therefore not recommended. if you use any of the following medicines during your treatment with yondelis, you need to be closely monitored as the effects of yondelis are: decreased (examples are medicines containing rifampicin (for bacterial infections), phenobarbital (for epilepsy) or st. john's wort (hypericum perforatum, an herbal medicine for depression)) or increased (examples are medicines containing ketoconazole or fluconazole (for fungal infections), ritonavir (for human immunodeficiency virus [hiv] infection), clarithromycin (for 36 bacterial infections), aprepitant (to prevent nausea and vomiting), ciclosporin (inhibit the defensive system of the body) or verapamil (for high blood pressure and heart conditions)). thus the use of any of these medicines together with yondelis should be avoided, if possible. if you are given yondelis or the combination yondelis+pld together with a medicine that might cause damage to the liver or to the muscles (rhabdomyolysis), you may need to be closely monitored, as there could be an increased risk of liver or muscle damage. medicines containing statins (for lowering cholesterol levels and preventing cardiovascular disease) is an example of medicines that may cause muscle damage. yondelis with alcohol alcohol consumption must be avoided during treatment with yondelis as this may harm the liver. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility pregnancy yondelis should not be used during pregnancy. if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. adequate contraceptive precautions must be used by women of childbearing potential when receiving yondelis and for 3 months following the end of treatment. if a pregnancy should occur you must tell your doctor immediately and genetic counselling is recommended since yondelis can cause genetic damage. breast-feeding yondelis must not be given to patients who are breast-feeding. therefore you must stop breast-feeding before you start your treatment and you must not begin breast-feeding again until your doctor has confirmed that it is safe to do so. fertility adequate contraceptive precautions must be used by men in fertile age when receiving yondelis and for 5 months following the end of treatment. patients should seek advice on ovules or sperm conservation prior to treatment because of the risk of irreversible infertility due to therapy with yondelis. genetic counselling is also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy. driving and using machines during your treatment with yondelis you may feel tired and experience a loss of strength. do not drive or use any tools or machines if you are experiencing any of these side effects. yondelis contains potassium this medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, and can therefore be considered as essentially \"potassium-free\".",

given to you under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of chemotherapy. its use should be confined to qualified oncologists or other health professionals specialised in the administration of cytotoxic medicines. for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, the usual dose is 1.5 mg/m2 of body surface area. during the treatment period, your doctor will carefully monitor you and decide the most appropriate dosage of yondelis to give to you. the recommended dose in japanese patients is lower than the usual dose for all other races, and is 1.2 mg/m2 of body surface area. for the treatment of ovarian cancer, the usual dose is 1.1 mg/m2 body surface area after the administration of 30 mg/m2 body surface area of pld. before yondelis is given to you, it is reconstituted and diluted for intravenous use. every time you are given yondelis for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, it will take about 24 hours for all of the solution to enter your blood. it will take 3 hours for the treatment of ovarian cancer. in order to avoid irritation at the site of injection it is recommended that yondelis is given to you through a central venous line. you will be given a medicine before and as needed during the treatment with yondelis in order to protect your liver and to reduce the risk of side effects such as feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting. the infusion is given to you every 3 weeks, although occasionally your doctor may recommend dose delays to ensure that you receive the most appropriate dose of yondelis. the length of your whole treatment period will depend on your progress and how well you feel. your doctor will tell you how long your treatment lasts. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.",

"like all medicines, this medicine or its combination with pld can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. if you are not sure what the side effects below are, you should ask your doctor to explain them to you in more detail. serious side effects caused by the treatment with yondelis: very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people you could have increased levels of the yellow pigment bilirubin in the blood which might cause jaundice (a yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes and eyes). your doctor will order regular blood tests to detect any abnormalities in the blood. common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people you may also have blood infections (sepsis) if your immune system is greatly compromised. if you have fever you should seek medical attention immediately. you could also feel pain in your muscles (myalgia). there could also be damage to your nerves which may result in muscle pain, weakness and numbness. you could experience general swelling or swelling of the limbs and a sensation of creeping on the skin. you may have a reaction at the site of injection. yondelis infusion may leak out of your vein while you are being given it, leading to damage and death of your tissue cells around the injection site (tissue necrosis, see also section 2 \"warnings and precautions\") which may require surgery. you could have an allergic reaction. in this case you may experience fever, difficulty in breathing, redness or flushing of the skin or a rash, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting). when yondelis is used in combination with pld, you may have syncope also called fainting. furthermore, you could feel like your heart is beating too hard or too fast in your chest (palpitations), have a weakness in the ventricles, the heart's major pumping chambers (left ventricular dysfunction), or a sudden blockage in a lung artery (pulmonary embolism). uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people you may feel severe muscle aches and pain, stiffness and muscle weakness. you also may experience a darkening of the urine colour. all the previously described, could be a sign of damage to your muscles (rhabdomyolysis). your doctor may require blood tests in certain situations in order to avoid that you develop muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis). in very severe cases this could lead to kidney failure. if you experience severe muscle pain or weakness, you should seek medical attention immediately. you may experience difficulty in breathing, irregular heartbeat, decreased urine output, abrupt change in mental status, areas of mottled skin, extremely low blood pressure associated with abnormal laboratory test results (decrease in platelet count). if you get any of the above symptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. you may experience an abnormal build-up of fluid in the lungs, which leads to swelling (pulmonary oedema). you may notice unexplained partial or general swelling (oedema), with possible lightheadedness, dizziness or thirst (low blood pressure). it could be a sign of a condition (capillary leak syndrome) that can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in your tissues. if you get the above symptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. you may notice that yondelis infusion leaks out of your vein (extravasation) while you are being given it. then you will notice some redness, swelling, itchiness and discomfort at the injection site. if you get any of these symptoms or signs, tell your nurse or doctor immediately. it could lead to damage and death of your tissue cells around the injection site (tissue necrosis) which may require surgery. some of the symptoms or signs of extravasation may not be visible until several hours after it occurred. there may be blistering, peeling and darkening of the skin over the site. it is possible for it to take a few days before the full extent of tissue damage is visible. if you get any of the previous described symptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. rare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people you may experience yellowing of your skin and eyeballs (jaundice), pain in the upper right area of your abdomen, nausea, vomiting, a general sense of not feeling well, difficulty in concentrating, disorientation or confusion, sleepiness. these signs could be indicative of the inability of the liver to perform its normal function. if you get any of the previous described symptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. other less serious side effects: very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people you may: feel tired feel difficulty breathing and coughing feel pain in your back and joints feel an excess of fluid in the body (oedema) bruise more easily have nose bleeds be more prone to infections. an infection could also give you a raised temperature (fever). if you develop any of these symptoms you should seek medical attention immediately. you may present some digestive symptoms such as loss of appetite, sick (nausea) or vomit, pain in the abdomen, diarrhoea or constipation. if you still feel sick, vomit or are unable to drink fluids and therefore pass less urine, despite being given anti-sickness medicine, you should immediately seek medical help. you may experience headache and sleeping problems. you could have mucosal inflammation as a swelling redness of the inside of the mouth leading to painful ulcers and mouth sores inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis), or as an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract when yondelis is used with pld. patients receiving yondelis plus pld for ovarian cancer may also have the hand and foot syndrome. it may present as red skin of the palms, fingers, and soles of the feet that later may become swollen and violaceous. the lesions may either dry out and desquamate, or blister with ulceration. common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people you may experience, loss of water from the body, weight loss, digestive discomfort and a change in your sense of taste. you may lose hair (alopecia). you could also experience dizziness, low blood pressure and flushing or skin rash. higher skin pigmentation could occur in patients receiving yondelis with pld for ovarian cancer. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 40 appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "yondelis", "Type":
