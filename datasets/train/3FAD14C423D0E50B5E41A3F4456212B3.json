CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital \nfactor VIII deficiency). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia. \n \nPreviously untreated patients \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Esperoct in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. \n \nTreatment monitoring \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII activity levels is advised to \nguide adjustments of the dosing regimen of Esperoct, if needed. Individual patients may vary in their \nresponse to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and incremental recoveries. Dose based on \nbodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, monitoring of the factor VIII substitution therapy by measurement \nof plasma factor VIII activity is necessary. \n \nThe factor VIII activity of Esperoct can be measured using the conventional factor VIII assays, the \nchromogenic assay and the one-stage assay.  \nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining \nfactor VIII activity in patients\u2019 blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly \naffected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay.  \nWhen using a one-stage clotting assay some silica based reagents should be avoided as they cause \nunderestimation. Also there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-\nbased one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance \nparticularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose, dosing interval and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the \nfactor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding, on the targeted factor VIII activity \nlevel and the patient\u2019s clinical condition. The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed \nin International Units (IU), which is related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII \nproducts. The activity of factor VIII in plasma is expressed either as percentage (relative to normal \nhuman plasma level) or in International Units per dL (relative to the current International Standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nOn demand treatment and treatment of bleeding episodes \n \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that \n1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by \n2 IU/dL. \n \nThe required dose is determined using the following formula: \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL). \n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n \nGuidance for the dosing of Esperoct for the on-demand treatment and treatment of bleeding episodes \nis provided in table 1. Plasma factor VIII activity levels should be maintained at or above the \ndescribed plasma levels (in IU per dL or % of normal). For treatment of bleeds a maximum single \ndose of Esperoct at 75 IU/kg and a maximum total dose of 200 IU/kg/24 hours may be administered. \n \nTable 1 Guidance for treatment of bleeding episodes with Esperoct \n\nDegree of haemorrhage Factor VIII level \nrequired (IU/dL \nor % of \nnormal)a  \n\nFrequency of \ndoses (hours) \n\nDuration of therapy \n\nMild \nEarly haemarthrosis, mild \nmuscle bleeding or mild \noral bleeding \n\n20-40 12-24 Until the bleeding is resolved \n\nModerate \nMore extensive \nhaemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding, haematoma \n\n30-60 12-24 Until the bleeding is resolved \n\nSevere or \nlife-threatening \nhaemorrhages \n\n60-100 8-24 Until the threat is resolved \n \n \n\na The required dose is determined using the following formula: \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL). \n \nPerioperative management \n \nThe dose level and dosing intervals for surgery depend on the procedure and local practice. A \nmaximum single dose of Esperoct at 75 IU/kg and a maximum total dose of 200 IU/kg/24 hours may \nbe administered. \nThe frequency of doses and duration of therapy should always be individually adjusted based on \nindividual clinical response. \n \nTable 2 includes general recommendation for dosing of Esperoct for perioperative management. \nConsideration should be given to maintain a factor VIII activity at or above the target range. \n \nTable 2 Guidance for dosing of Esperoct for perioperative management \n\nType of surgical \nprocedure \n\nFactor VIII \nlevel required \n(%) (IU/dL)a  \n\nFrequency of doses (hours) Duration of therapy \n\nMinor surgery \nIncluding tooth \nextraction \n\n30-60 Within one hour before \nsurgery \n \n\nSingle dose or repeat injection \nevery 24 hours for at least 1 day \nuntil healing is achieved \n\n\n\n5 \n\nRepeat after 24 hours if \nnecessary \n\nMajor surgery 80-100 \n(pre- and \npost-operative) \n\nWithin one hour before \nsurgery to achieve factor VIII \nactivity within the target \nrange \n \nRepeat every 8 to 24 hours to \nmaintain factor VIII activity \nwithin the target range \n\nRepeat injection every 8 to \n24 hours as necessary until \nadequate wound healing is \nachieved \n \nConsider to continue therapy for \nanother 7 days to maintain a \nfactor VIII activity of 30% to \n60% (IU/dL) \n\na The required dose is determined using the following formula: \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL). \n \nProphylaxis \nThe recommended starting dose is 50 IU of Esperoct per kg body weight every 4 days. \n \nThe maximum single dose is 75 IU/kg. \n \nAdjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved factor VIII \nlevels and individual bleeding tendency. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe dose in adolescents (12 years and above) is the same as for adults. \nIn children below 12 years long-term safety has not been established. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEsperoct is for intravenous use. \n \nEsperoct should be administered by intravenous injection (over approximately 2 minutes) after \nreconstitution of the powder with 4 mL supplied solvent (sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution \nfor injection). \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nKnown allergic reaction to hamster protein. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administraered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nAllergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Esperoct. The product contains traces of \nhamster proteins, which in some patients may cause allergic reactions. If symptoms of hypersensitivity \noccur, patients should be advised to immediately discontinue the use of the medicinal product and \ncontact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions \nincluding hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \n \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII pro-coagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) \nper ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the \nseverity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 \nexposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \nposing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nCardiovascular events \n \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase \nthe cardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications \n \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, the risk of CVAD-related complications \nincluding local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and adolescents (12-18 years). \n \nExcipient-related considerations \n \nThe medicinal product contains 30.5 mg sodium per reconstituted vial, equivalent to 1.5% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2.0 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) with other medicinal products have been \nreported. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation \nonly if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEsperoct has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nVery rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has \nbeen observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with Esperoct. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as \nan insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre is contacted. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions as observed in 270 unique subjects across five prospective, \nmulti-centre clinical studies in previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe haemophilia A (<1% \nendogenous factor VIII activity) and no history of inhibitors are listed in table 3. The categories of \nadverse reactions presented in table 3 is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC \nand Preferred Term Level). \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 3  Frequency of adverse reactions in clinical trials for PTPs* \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)** \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash \nErythema \nPruritus \n\nCommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration sites \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions*** Common \n\n* PTPs: Previously-treated patients. \n** Frequency is based on studies with all factor VIII products which included patients with severe haemophilia A. \n*** Preferred terms included in injection site reactions: Injection site reaction, Vessel puncture site haematoma, Infusion site reaction, \nInjection site erythema, Injection site rash, Vessel puncture site pain, and Injection site swelling. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nFactor VIII inhibitors \nOne confirmed case of factor VIII inhibitor occurred in an 18 year-old previously treated patient on \nprophylactic treatment with Esperoct. The patient had a factor VIII gene intron 22 inversion and was at \na high risk of developing factor VIII inhibitors.  \nThere is no indication of an increased risk of factor VIII inhibitor development with treatment of \nEsperoct as compared to other factor VIII products. \n \nAnti-drug antibodies \nThere was one case of persistent anti-drug antibodies concomitant with the confirmed case of factor VIII \ninhibitors (see Factor VIII inhibitors). Three patients had transiently positive test results for anti-drug \nantibodies after administration of Esperoct but no correlation with adverse events could be established. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nAnti-PEG antibodies \nThirty-two patients had pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies before administration of Esperoct. Twenty of \nthe 32 patients were negative for anti-PEG antibodies post administration of Esperoct. Eleven patients \ndeveloped transient low titre anti-PEG antibodies. No correlation with adverse events could be \nestablished. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo difference in the safety profile was observed between previously treated adolescents (12-18 years) \nand adult patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTuroctocog alfa pegol is a purified recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) product with a 40 kDa \npolyethylene-glycol (PEG) conjugated to the protein. The PEG is attached to the O-linked glycan in \nthe truncated B-domain of rFVIII (turoctocog alfa). The mechanism of action of turoctocog alfa pegol \nis based on the replacement of the deficient or absent factor VIII in patients with haemophilia A. \nWhen turoctocog alfa pegol is activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the B-domain containing the \nPEG moiety and the a3-region are cleaved off, thus generating activated recombinant factor VIII \n(rFVIIIa) which is similar in structure to native factor VIIIa. \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When injected into a haemophiliac patient, \nfactor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient\u2019s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a \ncofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. \nActivated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin \nand a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due \nto decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal \norgans, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By factor VIII replacement \ntherapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the \nfactor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. \n \nClinical efficacy during prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes \n \n\nThe clinical efficacy of Esperoct for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds was investigated in five \nprospective, multi-centre clinical studies in 270 previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe \nhaemophilia A. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nProphylaxis in adults/adolescents \n \nThe efficacy of Esperoct for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds was evaluated in an open-label, \nnon-controlled trial in adolescents and adult patients with severe haemophilia A ages 12 years and \nabove. The prophylactic effect of Esperoct was demonstrated with a dosing at 50 IU per kg body \nweight every 4 days or every 3\u20134 days (twice weekly) in 175 patients. The median annualised \nbleeding rate (ABR) in adults and adolescents receiving Esperoct was 1.18 (Interquartile range IQR: \n0.00;4.25), whereas the spontaneous ABR was 0.00 (IQR: 0.00;1.82), traumatic ABR was 0.00 (IQR: \n0.00;1.74) and joint ABR was 0.85 (IQR: 0.00;2.84). When including imputations, (replacing missing \ndata for withdrawn patients with a substituted value) the estimated mean ABR for all bleeds was \n3.70 (95% CI: 2.94;4.66). Of the 175 adults/adolescents on prophylaxis, 70 (40%) did not have any \nbleeds. The mean annual consumption for prophylaxis was 4641 IU/kg. \n \nOf note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and  \nbetween different clinical studies. \n \nAdults/adolescents who had a low bleeding rate of 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months and \nhad obtained at least 50 doses of Esperoct had the option of being randomised to prophylaxis treatment \nevery 7 days (75 IU/kg every 7 days) or every 4 days (50 IU/kg every 4 days). A total of 55 of the 120 \neligible patients chose to be randomised (17 to the every 4 days dosing and 38 to the 75 IU every \n7 days). The ABR for randomised patients was 1.77 (0.59; 5.32) for treatment every 4 days and 3.57 \n(2.13; 6.00) for once weekly prophylaxis. Nine of these patients reverted back to prophylaxis every \n4 days during the randomised study phase. Overall, including all extensions parts, 31 of 61 patients on \nevery 7 days prophylaxis switched back to every 4 days treatment. \n \nProphylaxis in children (below 12 years) \n \nThe use of Esperoct in children below 12 years is not indicated (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \nThe efficacy and safety of Esperoct for prophylaxis treatment of bleeds were evaluated in an \nopen-label, single-arm, non-controlled trial in 68 children below 12 years with severe haemophilia A. \nThe prophylactic effect of Esperoct was demonstrated with a dosing at 60 IU per kg body weight \n(50-75 IU/kg) twice weekly. The median and estimated mean annualised bleeding rate in children \nbelow 12 years receiving Esperoct twice weekly was 1.95 and 2.13 (95% CI: 1.48;3.06), whereas the \nspontaneous ABR was 0.00 and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.24;1.40), traumatic ABR was 0.00 and 1.52 (95% CI: \n1.07;2.17) and joint ABR was 0.00 and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.59;1.81), respectively. Of the 68 children \nbelow 12 years on prophylaxis, 29 (42.6%) did not have any bleeds. \nThe mean annual consumption for prophylaxis was 6475 IU/kg. \n \nClinical efficacy of Esperoct in treatment of bleeding episodes and during on-demand treatment \n \nThe efficacy of Esperoct in the treatment of bleeding episodes was demonstrated in all age groups. \nThe vast majority of bleeds treated with Esperoct were of mild/moderate severity. \nThe overall success rate for the treatment of bleeds was 87.7% and 94.4% of all bleeds treated with \n1-2 injections. \n \nIn 12 patients above 18 years of age, 1,126 bleedings were treated among patients receiving \non-demand treatment with an average treatment dose of 38.1 IU/kg with a mean annual consumption \nof 1457 IU/kg. Of the total 1,126 bleeds, 86.9% were effectively treated with 1 injection and 96.8% \nwere effectively treated with 1-2 injections of Esperoct. \n \nClinical efficacy of Esperoct during major surgery \n \nEsperoct was effective in maintaining haemostasis during major surgery with a success rate of 95.6% \nin all major surgeries performed (43 out of 45 had the effect rated as \u2018excellent\u2018 or \u2018good\u2018). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nIn total, 129 single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of Esperoct were evaluated in 86 patients \n(including 24 paediatric patients of 0 to below 12 years). \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with Esperoct were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nhaemophilia A (factor VIII <1%). Patients received a single dose of 50 IU/kg, and blood samples were \ncollected prior to dosing and at multiple time points up to 96 hours after dosing. \n \nThe half-life of Esperoct was 1.6 fold longer compared to unmodified factor VIII products in adults. \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters \n \nA total of 108 single dose pharmacokinetic profiles at 50 IU/kg Esperoct were evaluated in \n69 patients. The single dose pharmacokinetic parameters are comparable between young children (0 to \nbelow 6 years) and older children (6 to below 12 years), and between adolescents (12 to17 years) and \nadults (18 years and above). \nAs expected incremental recovery appeared to be lower while body weight adjusted clearance \nappeared to be higher in children compared to adults and adolescents. In general, there was a trend of \nincreasing incremental recovery and decreasing clearance (mL/h/kg) with age.

If \nnot used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nusers and would normally not be recommended for longer than as stated above, unless reconstitution \nhas taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.  \n \nThe reconstituted solution should be stored in the vial. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage at room temperature (\u226430\u00b0C) or up to 40\u00b0C and storage conditions after reconstitution of \nthe medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nEach pack of Esperoct contains: \n\u2013 1 glass vial (type I) with powder closed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper, an aluminium seal \n\nwith a plastic snap-off cap \n\u2013 1 sterile vial adapter for reconstitution \n\u2013 1 pre-filled syringe of 4 mL solvent with backstop (polypropylene), a rubber plunger \n\n(bromobutyl) and a rubber tip cap (bromobutyl) \n\u2013 1 plunger rod (polypropylene). \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nEsperoct is to be administered intravenously after reconstitution of the powder with the solvent \nsupplied in the syringe. After reconstitution the solution appears as a clear and colourless liquid free of \nvisible particles. The reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate \nmatter and discolouration prior to administration. The solution should be clear and colourless. Do not \nuse solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see the package \nleaflet. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined by the patient\u2019s comfort level over approximately \n2 minutes. \n \nAn infusion set (butterfly needle with tubing), sterile alcohol swabs, gauze pads and plasters will also \nbe needed. These devices are not included in the Esperoct package. \n \nAlways use an aseptic technique. \n \nDisposal \n \nAfter the injection, safely dispose of the syringe with the infusion set and the vial with the vial adapter. \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

What you need to know before you use Esperoct \n3. How to use Esperoct \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Esperoct \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Esperoct is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Esperoct is \nEsperoct contains the active substance turoctocog alfa pegol and is a long-acting recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII product. Factor VIII is a protein found in the blood that helps to prevent and \nstop bleeding. \n \nWhat Esperoct is used for \nEsperoct is used to treat and prevent bleeding in people 12 years and above with haemophilia A \n(inborn factor VIII deficiency). \n \nIn people with haemophilia A, factor VIII is missing or does not work properly. Esperoct replaces this \nfaulty or missing factor VIII and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Esperoct \n \nDo not use Esperoct \n\u2022 if you are allergic to the active substance or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n\u2022 if you are allergic to hamster proteins. \n \nDo not use Esperoct if either of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPrevious use of factor VIII medicine \nTell your doctor if you have used factor VIII medicines before, especially if you developed inhibitors \n(antibodies) against the medicine, since there might be a risk that it happens again. \n \nAllergic reactions \nThere is a risk that you may experience a severe and sudden allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylactic \nreaction) to Esperoct. \n \nStop the injection and contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if you have early signs of \nallergic reactions. These early signs may include rash, hives, weals, itching on large areas of skin, \nredness and/or swelling of lips, tongue, face or hands, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, wheezing, \ntightness of the chest, pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, or dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting. \n \nDevelopment of \u2018FVIII inhibitors\u2019 (antibodies) \nInhibitors (antibodies) can develop during the treatment with all factor VIII medicines \n\u2022 These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly \n\u2022 You will be monitored carefully for development of these inhibitors \n\u2022 If your bleeding is not being controlled with Esperoct, tell your doctor immediately \n\u2022 Do not increase the total dose of Esperoct to control your bleed without talking to your doctor. \n \nCatheter-related problems \nIf you have a catheter where medicines can be injected into your blood (central venous access device), \nyou may develop infections or blood clots at the site of the catheter. \n \nHeart disease \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have heart disease or you are at risk of heart disease. \n \nChildren \nEsperoct can not be used in children below 12 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Esperoct \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEsperoct has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nEsperoct contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 30.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per reconstituted vial. \nThis is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How to use Esperoct \n \nTreatment with Esperoct will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of people with \nhaemophilia A. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure about how to use Esperoct. \n \nHow Esperoct is given \n\n\n\n43 \n\nEsperoct is given as an injection into a vein (intravenously), see \u201cInstructions on how to use Esperoct\u201d \nfor more information. \n \nHow much to use \nYour doctor will calculate your dose for you. This will depend on your body weight and whether it is \nused to prevent or to treat a bleeding. \n \nTo prevent bleeding \nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and above): The recommended starting dose is 50 IU of \nEsperoct per kg body weight every 4 days. Your doctor may choose another dose or how often the \ninjections should be given, based on your need. \n \nTo treat bleeding \nThe dose of Esperoct is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. If you \nexperience that the effect of Esperoct is insufficient, talk to your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nAdolescents (12 years of age and above) can use the same dose as adults. \n \nIf you use more Esperoct than you should \nIf you use more Esperoct than you should, contact your doctor straight away. \n \nIf you have to significantly increase your usage of Esperoct to stop a bleed, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. For further information, see \u201cDevelopment of \u2018FVIII inhibitors\u2019 (antibodies)\u201d in section \n2. \n \nIf you forget to use Esperoct \nIf you forget a dose, inject the missed dose as soon as you remember. Do not inject a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as scheduled and continue as advised by \nyour doctor. If you are in doubt, contact your doctor. \n \nIf you stop using Esperoct \nDo not stop using Esperoct without talking to your doctor. \nIf you stop using Esperoct, you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not \nstop. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \nStop the injection immediately if you develop severe and sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic \nreactions). You must contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if you have signs of an \nallergic reaction such as: \n\u2022 difficulty in swallowing or breathing \n\u2022 wheezing \n\u2022 chest tightness \n\u2022 redness and/or swelling of the lips, tongue, face or hands \n\u2022 rash, hives, weals or itching \n\u2022 pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, or dizziness (low blood pressure) \n\u2022 headache, nausea or vomiting. \n \nDevelopment of \u2018FVIII inhibitors\u2019 (antibodies) \nIf you have previously received more than 150 days of treatment with factor VIII, inhibitors \n(antibodies) may develop (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If this happens, your medicine may stop \n\n\n\n44 \n\nworking properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact \nyour doctor immediately. See \u201cDevelopment of \u2018FVIII inhibitors\u2019 (antibodies)\u201d in section 2. \n \nThe following side effects have been observed with Esperoct \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 skin reactions where the injection is given \n\u2022 itching (pruritus) \n\u2022 redness of skin (erythema) \n\u2022 rash. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 allergic reactions (hypersensitivity). These may become severe and could be life-threatening, see \n\n\u201cAllergic reactions (hypersensitivity)\u201d above for more information \n\u2022 factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies) in patients previously treated with factor VIII. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.

Before injection, it must be reconstituted with the solvent supplied \nin the syringe. The solvent is a sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. The \nreconstituted product must be injected into your vein (intravenous (IV) injection). The equipment in \nthis package is designed to reconstitute and inject Esperoct. \n \nYou will also need: \n\u2022 an infusion set (butterfly needle with tubing) \n\u2022 sterile alcohol swabs \n\u2022 gauze pads and plasters. \nThese items are not included in the Esperoct package. \n \nDo not use the equipment without proper training from your doctor or nurse. \n \nAlways wash your hands and ensure that the area around you is clean. \n \nWhen you prepare and inject medicine directly into a vein, it is important to use a clean and \ngerm- free (aseptic) technique. An incorrect technique can introduce germs that can infect your \nblood. \n \nDo not open the equipment until you are ready to use it. \n \nDo not use the equipment if it has been dropped, or if it is damaged. Use a new package instead. \n \nDo not use the equipment if it has expired. Use a new package instead. The expiry date is printed \non the outer carton, on the vial, on the vial adapter, and on the pre-filled syringe. \n \nDo not use the equipment if you suspect it is contaminated. Use a new package instead. \n \nDo not dispose of any of the items until after you have injected the reconstituted solution. \n \nThe equipment is for single use only. \n\nContents \nThe package contains: \n\u2022 1 vial with Esperoct powder \n\u2022 1 vial adapter \n\u2022 1 pre-filled syringe with solvent \n\u2022 1 plunger rod (placed under the syringe) \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nOverview \n\nPlastic cap \nRubber stopper \n\n(under plastic cap) \n\nVial with Esperoct powder \n\n \n\n \nVial adapter \n\nProtective cap \n\nSpike \n(under protective paper) \n\nProtective \npaper \n\n \n\n Pre-filled syringe with solvent \n\nSyringe tip \n(under syringe cap) Scale \n\nPlunger \n\nSyringe cap \n \n\n Plunger rod \n\nThread Wide top \nend \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n1. Prepare the vial and the syringe \n \n\u2022 Take out the number of Esperoct packages you \n\nneed. \n \n\n\u2022 Check the expiry date. \n \n\n\u2022 Check the name, strength and colour of the \npackage to make sure it contains the correct \nproduct. \n \n\n\u2022 Wash your hands and dry them properly using a \nclean towel or let them air dry. \n \n\n\u2022 Take the vial, the vial adapter and the pre-filled \nsyringe out of the carton. Leave the plunger rod \nuntouched in the carton. \n \n\n\u2022 Bring the vial and the pre-filled syringe to \nroom temperature. You can do this by holding \nthem in your hands until they feel as warm as \nyour hands, see figure A. \n \nDo not use any other way to warm the vial and \npre-filled syringe. \n\n A \n\n \n\n\u2022 Remove the plastic cap from the vial. If the \nplastic cap is loose or missing, do not use the \nvial. \n\n \n\u2022 Wipe the rubber stopper with a sterile alcohol \n\nswab and allow it to air dry for a few seconds \nbefore use to ensure that it is as germ-free as \npossible. \n\n \nDo not touch the rubber stopper with your \nfingers as this can transfer germs. \n\n B \n\n \n\n2. Attach the vial adapter \n \n\u2022 Remove the protective paper from the vial \n\nadapter. \n \nIf the protective paper is not fully sealed or if it \nis broken, do not use the vial adapter. \n \nDo not take the vial adapter out of the \nprotective cap with your fingers. \nIf you touch the spike on the vial adapter, germs \nfrom your fingers can be transferred. \n\n C \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n\u2022 Place the vial on a flat and solid surface. \n \n\n\u2022 Turn over the protective cap, and snap the vial \nadapter onto the vial. \n \nOnce attached, do not remove the vial adapter \n\nfrom the vial. \n\n D \n\n \n\n\u2022 Lightly squeeze the protective cap with your \nthumb and index finger as shown. \n \n\n\u2022 Remove the protective cap from the vial \nadapter. \n \nDo not lift the vial adapter from the vial when \nremoving the protective cap. \n\n E \n\n \n\n3. Attach the plunger rod and the syringe \n \n\n\u2022 Grasp the plunger rod by the wide top end and \ntake it out of the carton. Do not touch the sides \nor the thread of the plunger rod. If you touch \nthe sides or the thread, germs from your fingers \ncan be transferred. \n \n\n\u2022 Immediately connect the plunger rod to the \nsyringe by turning it clockwise into the plunger \ninside the pre-filled syringe until resistance is felt. \n\n F \n\n \n\n\u2022 Remove the syringe cap from the pre-filled \nsyringe by bending it down until the perforation \nbreaks. \n \nDo not touch the syringe tip under the syringe \ncap. If you touch the syringe tip, germs from your \nfingers can be transferred. \n \nIf the syringe cap is loose or missing, do not \n\nuse \nthe pre-filled syringe. \n\n G \n\n \n\n\u2022 Screw the pre-filled syringe securely onto the \nvial adapter until resistance is felt. \n\n H \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n4. Reconstitute the powder with the solvent \n \n\n\u2022 Hold the pre-filled syringe slightly tilted with \nthe vial pointing downwards. \n \n\n\u2022 Push the plunger rod to inject all the solvent \ninto the vial. \n\n I \n\n \n\n\u2022 Keep the plunger rod pressed down and swirl \nthe vial gently until all the powder is dissolved. \n\n \nDo not shake the vial as this will cause \nfoaming. \n\n \n\u2022 Check the reconstituted solution. It must be \n\nclear and colourless and no particles should be \nvisible. If you notice particles or \ndiscolouration, do not use it. Use a new package \ninstead. \n\n J \n\n \n\nEsperoct is recommended to be used immediately after it has been reconstituted. \n \nIf you cannot use the reconstituted Esperoct solution immediately, it should be used within: \n\u2022 24 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C) or \n\u2022 4 hours (\u226430\u00b0C) or \n\u2022 1 hour between >30C and 40\u00b0C, only if the product was stored above room temperature \n\n(>30\u00b0C up to 40\u00b0C) before reconstitution for no longer than 3 months. \n \nStore the reconstituted product in the vial. \n \nDo not freeze the reconstituted solution or store it in syringes. \n \nKeep the reconstituted solution out of direct light. \n \n\n \nIf your dose requires more than one vial, repeat steps A to J with additional vials, vial adapters and \npre-filled syringes until you have reached your required dose. \n\n\u2022 Keep the plunger rod pushed \ncompletely in. \n\n \n\u2022 Turn the syringe with the vial upside \n\ndown. \n \n\n\u2022 Stop pushing the plunger rod and let it \nmove back on its own while the \nreconstituted solution fills the syringe. \n\n \n\u2022 Pull the plunger rod slightly \n\ndownwards to draw the reconstituted \nsolution into the syringe. \n\n K \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\u2022 If you do not need to use all of the \n\nreconstituted medicine from the vial, \nuse the scale on the syringe to withdraw \nthe dose you need, as instructed by your \ndoctor or nurse. \n \nIf, at any point, there is air in the syringe, \ninject the air back into the vial. \n \n\n\u2022 While holding the vial upside down, tap \nthe syringe gently to let any air bubbles \nrise to the top. \n \n\n\u2022 Push the plunger rod slowly until all air \nbubbles are gone. \n\n\u2022 Unscrew the vial adapter with the vial. \n \nDo not touch the syringe tip. If you \ntouch the syringe tip, germs from your \nfingers can be transferred. \n\n L \n\n \n\n5. Inject the reconstituted solution \n \nEsperoct is now ready to be injected into your vein. \n\u2022 Inject the reconstituted solution as instructed by your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 Inject slowly over approximately 2 minutes. \n \nDo not mix Esperoct with any other intravenous injections or medicines. \n \nInjecting Esperoct via needleless connectors for intravenous (IV) catheters \n \nCaution: The pre-filled syringe is made of glass and is designed to be compatible with standard \nluer-lock connections. Some needleless connectors with an internal spike are incompatible with the \npre-filled syringe. This incompatibility may prevent administration of the medicine and result in \ndamage to the needleless connector. \n \nInjecting the solution via a central venous access device (CVAD) such as a central venous catheter \nor a subcutaneous port: \n\u2022 Use a clean and germ-free (aseptic) technique. Follow the instructions for proper use for your \n\nconnector and CVAD in consultation with your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 Injecting into a CVAD may require using a sterile 10 mL plastic syringe for withdrawal of \n\nthe reconstituted solution. This should be done right after step J. \n\u2022 If the CVAD line needs to be flushed before or after the injection of Esperoct, use sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. \n\n\n\n52 \n\nDisposal \n \n\n\u2022 After injection, safely dispose of all \nunused Esperoct solution, the syringe with \nthe infusion set, the vial with the vial \nadapter and other waste materials as \ninstructed by your pharmacist. \n \nDo not throw it out with the ordinary \nhousehold waste. \n\n M \n\n \n\nDo not disassemble the equipment before disposal. \n \nDo not reuse the equipment. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

month. before reconstitution (before the powder is mixed with the solvent): store in a refrigerator (2 - 8). esperoct can be kept at room temperature (\u226430) for a single period for up to 12 months within the shelf life of the product or above room temperature (>30 up to 40) for a single period for up to 3 months within the shelf life of the product. when you start to store esperoct outside the refrigerator, record the date and the storage temperature in the space provided on the carton. once you have taken the product out of the refrigerator for storage you must not store it again in the refrigerator.do not freeze. store in the original package in order to protect from light. after reconstitution (after the powder has been mixed with the solvent): once you have reconstituted esperoct, it should be used immediately. if you cannot use the reconstituted solution immediately, it should be used within 24 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2 - 8) or 4 hours at \u226430 or 1 hour
