CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nMyelofibrosis (MF) \n\n \n\nJakavi is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients \n\nwith primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post polycythaemia vera \n\nmyelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. \n\n \n\nPolycythaemia vera (PV) \n\n \n\nJakavi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or \n\nintolerant of hydroxyurea. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nJakavi treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of \n\nanti-cancer medicinal products. \n\n \n\nA complete blood cell count, including a white blood cell count differential, must be performed before \n\ninitiating therapy with Jakavi. \n\n \n\nComplete blood count, including a white blood cell count differential, should be monitored every \n\n2-4 weeks until Jakavi doses are stabilised, and then as clinically indicated (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nStarting dose \n\nThe recommended starting dose of ruxolitinib in MF is 15 mg twice daily for patients with a platelet \n\ncount between 100,000/mm3 and 200,000/mm3 and 20 mg twice daily for patients with a platelet count \n\nof >200,000/mm3. The recommended starting dose of ruxolitinib in PV is 10 mg given orally twice \n\ndaily. \n\n \n\nThere is limited information to recommend a starting dose for patients with platelet counts between \n\n50,000/mm3 and <100,000/mm3. The maximum recommended starting dose in these patients is 5 mg \n\ntwice daily and the patients should be titrated cautiously. \n\n \n\nDose modifications \n\nDoses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy. Treatment should be discontinued for platelet \n\ncounts less than 50,000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil counts less than 500/mm3. In PV, treatment should \n\nalso be interrupted when haemoglobin is below 8 g/dl. After recovery of blood counts above these \n\nlevels, dosing may be re-started at 5 mg twice daily and gradually increased based on careful \n\nmonitoring of complete blood cell count, including a white blood cell count differential. \n\n \n\nDose reductions should be considered if the platelet count decreases below 100,000/mm3, with the \n\ngoal of avoiding dose interruptions for thrombocytopenia. In PV, dose reductions should also be \n\nconsidered if haemoglobin decreases below 12 g/dl and is recommended if it decreases below 10 g/dl. \n\n \n\nIf efficacy is considered insufficient and blood counts are adequate, doses may be increased by a \n\nmaximum of 5 mg twice daily, up to the maximum dose of 25 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nThe starting dose should not be increased within the first four weeks of treatment and thereafter no \n\nmore frequently than at 2-week intervals. \n\n \n\nThe maximum dose of ruxolitinib is 25 mg twice daily. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nDose adjustment with concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole \n\nWhen ruxolitinib is administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and \n\nCYP3A4 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole) the unit dose of ruxolitinib should be reduced by approximately \n\n50%, to be administered twice daily (see section 4.5). Avoid the concomitant use of ruxolitinib with \n\nfluconazole doses greater than 200 mg daily. \n\n \n\nMore frequent monitoring (e.g. twice a week) of haematology parameters and of clinical signs and \n\nsymptoms of ruxolitinib-related adverse drug reactions is recommended while on strong CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitors or dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo specific dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) the recommended \n\nstarting dose based on platelet count for MF patients should be reduced by approximately 50% to be \n\nadministered twice daily. The recommended starting dose for PV patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment is 5 mg twice daily. Patients should be carefully monitored with regard to safety and \n\nefficacy during ruxolitinib treatment. \n\n \n\nThere are limited data to determine the best dosing options for patients with end-stage renal disease \n\n(ESRD) on haemodialysis. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulations based on available data in \n\nthis population suggest that the starting dose for MF patients with ESRD on haemodialysis is a single \n\ndose of 15-20 mg or two doses of 10 mg given 12 hours apart, to be administered post-dialysis and \n\nonly on the day of haemodialysis. A single dose of 15 mg is recommended for MF patients with \n\nplatelet count between 100,000/mm3 and 200,000/mm3. A single dose of 20 mg or two doses of 10 mg \n\ngiven 12 hours apart is recommended for MF patients with platelet count of >200,000/mm3. \n\nSubsequent doses (single administration or two doses of 10 mg given 12 hours apart) should be \n\nadministered only on haemodialysis days following each dialysis session. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose for PV patients with ESRD on haemodialysis is a single dose of \n\n10 mg or two doses of 5 mg given 12 hours apart, to be administered post-dialysis and only on the day \n\nof haemodialysis. These dose recommendations are based on simulations and any dose modification in \n\nESRD should be followed by careful monitoring of safety and efficacy in individual patients. No data \n\nis available for dosing patients who are undergoing peritoneal dialysis or continuous venovenous \n\nhaemofiltration (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with any hepatic impairment the recommended starting dose based on platelet count should \n\nbe reduced by approximately 50% to be administered twice daily. Subsequent doses should be \n\nadjusted based on careful monitoring of safety and efficacy. Patients diagnosed with hepatic \n\nimpairment while receiving ruxolitinib should have complete blood counts, including a white blood \n\ncell count differential, monitored at least every one to two weeks for the first 6 weeks after initiation \n\nof therapy with ruxolitinib and as clinically indicated thereafter once their liver function and blood \n\ncounts have been stabilised. Ruxolitinib dose can be titrated to reduce the risk of cytopenia. \n\n \n\nElderly patients (≥65 years) \n\nNo additional dose adjustments are recommended for elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Jakavi in children and adolescents aged up to 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available (see section 5.1). \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nTreatment discontinuation \n\nTreatment may be continued as long as the benefit-risk remains positive. However the treatment \n\nshould be discontinued after 6 months if there has been no reduction in spleen size or improvement in \n\nsymptoms since initiation of therapy. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that, for patients who have demonstrated some degree of clinical improvement, \n\nruxolitinib therapy be discontinued if they sustain an increase in their spleen length of 40% compared \n\nwith baseline size (roughly equivalent to a 25% increase in spleen volume) and no longer have \n\ntangible improvement in disease-related symptoms. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nJakavi is to be taken orally, with or without food. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should not take an additional dose, but should take the next usual \n\nprescribed dose. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and lactation. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nMyelosuppression \n\n \n\nTreatment with Jakavi can cause haematological adverse drug reactions, including thrombocytopenia, \n\nanaemia and neutropenia. A complete blood count, including a white blood cell count differential, \n\nmust be performed before initiating therapy with Jakavi. Treatment should be discontinued in patients \n\nwith platelet count less than 50,000/mm3 or absoute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3 (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nIt has been observed that patients with low platelet counts (<200,000/mm3) at the start of therapy are \n\nmore likely to develop thrombocytopenia during treatment. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia is generally reversible and is usually managed by reducing the dose or temporarily \n\nwithholding Jakavi (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). However, platelet transfusions may be required as \n\nclinically indicated. \n\n \n\nPatients developing anaemia may require blood transfusions. Dose modifications or interruption for \n\npatients developing anaemia may also be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients with a haemoglobin level below 10.0 g/dl at the beginning of the treatment have a higher risk \n\nof developing a haemoglobin level below 8.0 g/dl during treatment compared to patients with a higher \n\nbaseline haemoglobin level (79.3% versus 30.1%). More frequent monitoring of haematology \n\nparameters and of clinical signs and symptoms of Jakavi-related adverse drug reactions is \n\nrecommended for patients with baseline haemoglobin below 10.0 g/dl. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500) was generally reversible and was managed by \n\ntemporarily withholding Jakavi (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nComplete blood counts should be monitored as clinically indicated and dose adjusted as required (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nSerious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, viral and other opportunistic infections have occurred in \n\npatients treated with Jakavi. Patients should be assessed for the risk of developing serious infections. \n\nPhysicians should carefully observe patients receiving Jakavi for signs and symptoms of infections \n\nand initiate appropriate treatment promptly. Treatment with Jakavi should not be started until active \n\nserious infections have resolved. \n\n \n\nTuberculosis has been reported in patients receiving Jakavi. Before starting treatment, patients should \n\nbe evaluated for active and inactive (“latent”) tuberculosis, as per local recommendations. This can \n\ninclude medical history, possible previous contact with tuberculosis, and/or appropriate screening such \n\nas lung x-ray, tuberculin test and/or interferon-gamma release assay, as applicable. Prescribers are \n\nreminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are \n\nseverely ill or immunocompromised. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titre) increases, with and without associated elevations in alanine \n\naminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, have been reported in patients with chronic HBV \n\ninfections taking Jakavi. The effect of Jakavi on viral replication in patients with chronic HBV \n\ninfection is unknown. Patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated and monitored according \n\nto clinical guidelines. \n\n \n\nHerpes zoster \n\n \n\nPhysicians should educate patients about early signs and symptoms of herpes zoster, advising that \n\ntreatment should be sought as early as possible. \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported with Jakavi treatment. \n\nPhysicians should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that patients may not notice \n\n(e.g., cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms or signs). Patients should be monitored for any \n\nof these new or worsening symptoms or signs, and if such symptoms/signs occur, referral to a \n\nneurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be considered. If PML is suspected, \n\nfurther dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including basal cell, squamous cell, and Merkel cell \n\ncarcinoma, have been reported in patients treated with ruxolitinib. Most of these patients had histories \n\nof extended treatment with hydroxyurea and prior NMSC or pre-malignant skin lesions. A causal \n\nrelationship to ruxolitinib has not been established. Periodic skin examination is recommended for \n\npatients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. \n\n \n\nLipid abnormalities/elevations \n\n \n\nTreatment with Jakavi has been associated with increases in lipid parameters including total \n\ncholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, \n\nand triglycerides. Lipid monitoring and treatment of dyslipidaemia according to clinical guidelines is \n\nrecommended. \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe starting dose of Jakavi should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment. For patients \n\nwith end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis the starting dose for MF patients should be based on \n\nplatelet counts (see section 4.2). Subsequent doses (single dose of 20 mg or two doses of 10 mg given \n\n12 hours apart in MF patients; single dose of 10 mg or two doses of 5 mg given 12 hours apart in PV \n\npatients) should be administered only on haemodialysis days following each dialysis session. \n\nAdditional dose modifications should be made with careful monitoring of safety and efficacy (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe starting dose of Jakavi should be reduced by approximately 50% in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Further dose modifications should be based on the safety and efficacy of the medicinal \n\nproduct (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nInteractions \n\n \n\nIf Jakavi is to be co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and \n\nCYP2C9 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole), the unit dose of Jakavi should be reduced by approximately \n\n50%, to be administered twice daily (for monitoring frequency see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of cytoreductive therapies with Jakavi was associated with manageable \n\ncytopenias (see section 4.2 for dose modifications during cytopenias). \n\n \n\nWithdrawal effects \n\n \n\nFollowing interruption or discontinuation of Jakavi, symptoms of MF may return over a period of \n\napproximately one week. There have been cases of patients discontinuing Jakavi who sustained more \n\nsevere events, particularly in the presence of acute intercurrent illness. It has not been established \n\nwhether abrupt discontinuation of Jakavi contributed to these events. Unless abrupt discontinuation is \n\nrequired, gradual tapering of the dose of Jakavi may be considered, although the utility of the tapering \n\nis unproven. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nJakavi contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib is eliminated through metabolism catalysed by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Thus, medicinal \n\nproducts inhibiting these enzymes can give rise to increased ruxolitinib exposure. \n\n \n\nInteractions resulting in dose reduction of ruxolitinib \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as, but not limited to, boceprevir, clarithromycin, indinavir, \n\nitraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, \n\nposaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) \n\nIn healthy subjects co-administration of ruxolitinib (10 mg single dose) with a strong CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC that were higher by 33% and 91%, \n\nrespectively, than with ruxolitinib alone. The half-life was prolonged from 3.7 to 6.0 hours with \n\nconcurrent ketoconazole administration. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nWhen administering ruxolitinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors the unit dose of ruxolitinib should be \n\nreduced by approximately 50%, to be administered twice daily. Patients should be closely monitored \n\n(e.g. twice weekly) for cytopenias and dose titrated based on safety and efficacy (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nDual CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nIn healthy subjects co-administration of ruxolitinib (10 mg single dose) with a dual CYP2C9 and \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitor, fluconazole, resulted in ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC that were higher by 47% and \n\n232%, respectively, than with ruxolitinib alone. \n\n \n\n50% dose reduction should be considered when using medicinal products which are dual inhibitors of \n\nCYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole). Avoid the concomitant use of ruxolitinib with \n\nfluconazole doses greater than 200 mg daily. \n\n \n\nEnzyme inducers \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers (such as, but not limited to, avasimibe, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \n\nrifabutin, rifampin (rifampicin), St.John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) \n\nPatients should be closely monitored and the dose titrated based on safety and efficacy (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nIn healthy subjects given ruxolitinib (50 mg single dose) following the potent CYP3A4 inducer \n\nrifampicin (600 mg daily dose for 10 days), ruxolitinib AUC was 70% lower than after administration \n\nof ruxolitinib alone. The exposure of ruxolitinib active metabolites was unchanged. Overall, the \n\nruxolitinib pharmacodynamic activity was similar, suggesting the CYP3A4 induction resulted in \n\nminimal effect on the pharmacodynamics. However, this could be related to the high ruxolitinib dose \n\nresulting in pharmacodynamic effects near Emax. It is possible that in the individual patient, an increase \n\nof the ruxolitinib dose is needed when initiating treatment with a strong enzyme inducer. \n\n \n\nOther interactions to be considered affecting ruxolitinib \n\n \n\nMild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as, but not limited to, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, \n\namprenavir, atazanavir, diltiazem, cimetidine) \n\nIn healthy subjects co-administration of ruxolitinib (10 mg single dose) with erythromycin 500 mg \n\ntwice daily for four days resulted in ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC that were higher by 8% and 27%, \n\nrespectively, than with ruxolitinib alone. \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended when ruxolitinib is co-administered with mild or moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin). However, patients should be closely monitored for cytopenias \n\nwhen initiating therapy with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. \n\n \n\nEffects of ruxolitinib on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nSubstances transported by P-glycoprotein or other transporters \n\nRuxolitinib may inhibit P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in the intestine. \n\nThis may result in increased sytemic exposure of substrates of these transporters, such as dabigatran \n\netexilate, ciclosporin, rosuvastatin and potentially digoxin. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) or \n\nclinical monitoring of the affected substance is advised. \n\n \n\nIt is possible that the potential inhibition of P-gp and BCRP in the intestine can be minimised if the \n\ntime between administrations is kept apart as long as possible. \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nA study in healthy subjects indicated that ruxolitinib did not inhibit the metabolism of the oral \n\nCYP3A4 substrate midazolam. Therefore, no increase in exposure of CYP3A4 substrates is \n\nanticipated when combining them with ruxolitinib. Another study in healthy subjects indicated that \n\nruxolitinib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol \n\nand levonorgestrel. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the contraceptive efficacy of this combination \n\nwill be compromised by co-administration of ruxolitinib. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no data from the use of Jakavi in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies have shown that ruxolitinib is embryotoxic and foetotoxic. Teratogenicity was not \n\nobserved in rats or rabbits. However, the exposure margins compared to the highest clinical dose were \n\nlow and the results are therefore of limited relevance for humans (see section 5.3). The potential risk \n\nfor humans is unknown. As a precautionary measure, the use of Jakavi during pregnancy is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during the treatment with Jakavi. \n\nIn case pregnancy should occur during treatment with Jakavi, a risk/benefit evaluation must be carried \n\nout on an individual basis with careful counselling regarding potential risks to the foetus (see \n\nsection 5.3). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nJakavi must not be used during breast-feeding (see section 4.3) and breast-feeding should therefore be \n\ndiscontinued when treatment is started. It is unknown whether ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites are \n\nexcreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Available \n\npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ruxolitinib and its \n\nmetabolites in milk (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no human data on the effect of ruxolitinib on fertility. In animal studies, no effect on fertility \n\nwas observed. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nJakavi has no or negligible sedating effect. However, patients who experience dizziness after the \n\nintake of Jakavi should refrain from driving or using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nMyelofibrosis \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anaemia. \n\n \n\nHaematological adverse drug reactions (any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \n\n[CTCAE] grade) included anaemia (83.8%), thrombocytopenia (80.5%) and neutropenia (20.8%). \n\n \n\nAnaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are dose-related effects. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe three most frequent non-haematological adverse drug reactions were bruising (33.3%), other \n\nbleeding (including epistaxis, post-procedural haemorrhage and haematuria) (24.3%) and dizziness \n\n(21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe three most frequent non-haematological laboratory abnormalities were raised alanine \n\naminotransferase (40.7%), raised aspartate aminotransferase (31.5%) and hypertriglyceridaemia \n\n(25.2%). In phase 3 clinical studies in MF, neither CTCAE grade 3 or 4 hypertriglyceridaemia or \n\nraised aspartate aminotransferase, nor CTCAE grade 4 raised alanine aminotransferase or \n\nhypercholesterolaemia were observed. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation due to adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 30.0% of patients. \n \n\nPolycythaemia vera \n\nHaematological adverse reactions (any CTCAE grade) included anaemia (61.8%) and \n\nthrombocytopenia (25.0%). Anaemia and thrombocytopenia CTCAE grade 3 or 4 were reported in \n\nrespectively 2.9% and 2.6%. \n\n \n\nThe three most frequent non-haematological adverse reactions were weight gain (20.3%), dizziness \n\n(19.4%) and headache (17.9%). \n\n \n\nThe three most frequent non-haematological laboratory abnormalities (any CTCAE grade) identified \n\nas adverse reactions were raised alanine aminotransferase (45.3%), raised aspartate aminotransferase \n\n(42.6%), and hypercholesterolaemia (34.7%). No CTCAE grade 4 raised alanine aminotransferase or \n\nhypercholesterolaemia, and one CTCAE grade 4 raised aspartate aminotransferase were observed. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation due to adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 19.4% of patients. \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse drug reactions from clinical studies \n\n \n\nSafety in MF patients was evaluated using the long-term follow-up data from two phase 3 studies \n\n(COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II) including data from patients initially randomised to ruxolitinib \n\n(n=301) and patients who received ruxolitinib after crossing over from control treatments (n=156). \n\nThe median exposure upon which the ADR frequencies categories for MF patients are based was \n\n30.5 months (range 0.3 to 68.1 months). \n\n \n\nSafety in PV patients was evaluated using the long-term follow-up data from two phase 3 studies \n\n(RESPONSE, RESPONSE 2) including data from patients initially randomised to ruxolitinib (n=184) \n\nand patients who received ruxolitinib after crossing over from control treatments (n=156). The median \n\nexposure upon which the ADR frequencies categories for PV patients are based was 41.7 months \n\n(range 0.03 to 59.7 months). \n \n\nIn the clinical study programme the severity of adverse drug reactions was assessed based on the \n\nCTCAE, defining grade 1 = mild, grade 2 = moderate, grade 3 = severe and grade 4=life-threatening. \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions from clinical studies (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. \n\nWithin each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most \n\nfrequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug \n\nreaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 1 Frequency category of adverse drug reactions reported in the phase 3 studies \n\n(COMFORT-I, COMFORT-II, RESPONSE, RESPONSE 2) \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reaction Frequency category for MF \n\npatients \n\nFrequency category for PV \n\npatients \n\nInfections and infestations   \n\nUrinary tract infectionsa,d Very common Very common \n\nHerpes zostera,d Very common Very common \n\nPneumonia Very common Common \n\nSepsis Common Uncommon \n\nTuberculosise Uncommon Unknownf \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisordersb,d \n\n  \n\nAnaemiab   \n\nCTCAEc grade 4 \n\n(<6.5g/dl) \n\nVery common Uncommon \n\nCTCAEc grade 3 \n\n(<8.0 – 6.5g/dl) \n\nVery common Common \n\nAny CTCAEc grade Very common Very common \n\nThrombocytopeniab   \n\nCTCAEc grade 4 \n\n(<25,000/mm3) \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nCTCAEc grade 3 \n\n(50,000 – 25,000/mm3) \n\nVery common Common \n\nAny CTCAEc grade Very common Very common \n\nNeutropeniab   \n\nCTCAEc grade 4 \n\n(<500/mm3) \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nCTCAEc grade 3 \n\n(<1,000 – 500/mm3) \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nAny CTCAEc grade Very common Very common \n\nBleeding (any bleeding \n\nincluding intracranial, and \n\ngastrointestinal bleeding, \n\nbruising and other bleeding) \n\nVery common Very common \n\nBruising Very common Very common \n\nGastrointestinal bleeding Very common Common \n\nIntracranial bleeding Common Uncommon \n\nOther bleeding (including \n\nepistaxis, post-procedural \n\nhaemorrhage and \n\nhaematuria) \n\nVery common Very common \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\n  \n\nHypercholesterolaemiab \n\nany CTCAEc grade \n\nVery common Very common \n\nHypertriglyceridaemiab \n\nany CTCAEc grade \n\nVery common Very common \n\nWeight gaina Very common Very common \n\nNervous system disorders   \n\nDizzinessa Very common Very common \n\nHeadachea Very common Very common \n\n\n\n12 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders   \n\nElevated lipase, any CTCAEc \n\ngrade \nVery common Very common \n\nConstipationa Very common Very common \n\nFlatulencea Common Common \n\nHepatobiliary disorders   \n\nRaised alanine \n\naminotransferaseb \n\n  \n\nCTCAEc grade 3 \n\n(> 5x – 20 x ULN) \n\nCommon Common \n\nAny CTCAEc grade Very common Very common \n\nRaised aspartate \n\naminotransferaseb \n\n  \n\nAny CTCAEc grade Very common Very common \n\nVascular disorders   \n\nHypertensiona Very common Very common \na Frequency is based on adverse event data. \n\n- A subject with multiple occurrence of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) is counted only \nonce in that ADR category. \n\n- ADRs reported are on treatment or up to 28 days post treatment end date. \nb Frequency is based on laboratory values. \n\n- A subject with multiple occurrences of an ADR is counted only once in that ADR \ncategory. \n\n- ADRs reported are on treatment or up to 28 days post treatment end date. \nc Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0; grade 1 = mild, \n\ngrade 2 = moderate, grade 3 = severe, grade 4 = life-threatening \nd These ADRs are discussed in the text. \ne Frequency is based on all patients exposed to ruxolitinib in clinical studies (N=4755) \nf ADR derived from post-marketing experience \n\n \n\nUpon discontinuation, MF patients may experience a return of MF symptoms such as fatigue, bone \n\npain, fever, pruritus, night sweats, symptomatic splenomegaly and weight loss. In clinical studies in \n\nMF the total symptom score for MF symptoms gradually returned to baseline value within 7 days after \n\ndose discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n\n \n\nAnaemia \n\nIn phase 3 clinical studies in MF, median time to onset of first CTCAE grade 2 or higher anaemia was \n\n1.5 months. One patient (0.3%) discontinued treatment because of anaemia. \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving ruxolitinib mean decreases in haemoglobin reached a nadir of approximately \n10 g/litre below baseline after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy and then gradually recovered to reach a new \n\nsteady state that was approximately 5 g/litre below baseline. This pattern was observed in patients \n\nregardless of whether they had received transfusion during therapy. \n\n \n\nIn the randomised, placebo-controlled study COMFORT-I 60.6% of Jakavi-treated MF patients and \n\n37.7% of placebo-treated MF patients received red blood cell transfusions during randomised \n\ntreatment. In the COMFORT-II study the rate of packed red blood cell transfusions was 53.4% in the \n\nJakavi arm and 41.1% in the best available therapy arm. \n\n \n\nIn the randomised period of the pivotal studies, anaemia was less frequent in PV patients than in MF \n\npatients (40.8% versus 82.4%). In the PV population, the CTCAE grade 3 and 4 events were reported \n\nin 2.7%, while in the MF patients the frequency was 42.56%. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nIn the phase 3 clinical studies in MF, in patients who developed grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the \nmedian time to onset was approximately 8 weeks. Thrombocytopenia was generally reversible with \n\ndose reduction or dose interruption. The median time to recovery of platelet counts above 50,000/mm3 \n\nwas 14 days. During the randomised period, platelet transfusions were administered to 4.7% of \n\npatients receiving ruxolitinib and to 4.0% of patients receiving control regimens. Discontinuation of \n\ntreatment because of thrombocytopenia occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving ruxolitinib and 0.9% \nof patients receiving control regimens. Patients with a platelet count of 100,000/mm3 to 200,000/mm3 \n\nbefore starting ruxolitinib had a higher frequency of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia compared to \npatients with platelet count >200,000/mm3 (64.2% versus 38.5%). \n\n \n\nIn the randomised period of the pivotal studies, the rate of patients experiencing thrombocytopenia \n\nwas lower in PV (16.8%) patients compared to MF (69.8%) patients. The frequency of severe (i.e. \n\nCTCAE grade 3 and 4) thrombocytopenia was lower in PV (2.7%) than in MF (11.6%) patients. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia \n\nIn the phase 3 clinical studies in MF, in patients who developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median \n\ntime to onset was 12 weeks. During the randomised period, dose holding or reductions due to \n\nneutropenia were reported in 1.0% of patients, and 0.3% of patients discontinued treatment because of \n\nneutropenia. \n\n \n\nIn the randomised period of the phase 3 studies in PV patients, neutropenia was reported in 1.6% of \n\npatients exposed to ruxolitinib compared to 7% in reference treatments. In the ruxolitinib arm one \n\npatient developed CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia. An extended follow-up of patients treated with \n\nruxolitinib showed 2 patients reporting CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia. \n\n \n\nBleeding \n\nIn the phase 3 pivotal studies in MF bleeding events (including intracranial and gastrointestinal, \n\nbruising and other bleeding events) were reported in 32.6% of patients exposed to ruxolitinib and \n23.2% of patients exposed to the reference treatments (placebo or best available therapy). The \n\nfrequency of grade 3-4 events was similar for patients treated with ruxolitinib or reference treatments \n(4.7% versus 3.1%). Most of the patients with bleeding events during the treatment reported bruising \n\n(65.3%). Bruising events were more frequently reported in patients taking ruxolitinib compared with \nthe reference treatments (21.3% versus 11.6%). Intracranial bleeding was reported in 1% of patients \n\nexposed to ruxolitinib and 0.9% exposed to reference treatments. Gastrointestinal bleeding was \n\nreported in 5.0% of patients exposed to ruxolitinib compared to 3.1% exposed to reference \ntreatments. Other bleeding events (including events such as epistaxis, post-procedural haemorrhage \n\nand haematuria) were reported in 13.3% of patients treated with ruxolitinib and 10.3% treated with \nreference treatments. \n\n \n\nDuring the long-term follow-up of phase 3 clinical studies in MF, the cumulative frequency of \n\nbleeding events increased proportionally to the increase in the follow-up time. Bruising events were \n\nthe most frequently reported bleeding events (33.3%). Intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding events \n\nwere reported in 1.3% and 10.1% of patients respectively. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIn the comparative period of phase 3 studies in PV patients, bleeding events (including intracranial and \n\ngastrointestinal, bruising and other bleeding events) were reported in 16.8% of patients treated with \n\nruxolitinib, 15.3% of patients receiving best available therapy in RESPONSE study and 12.0% of \npatients receiving best available therapy in RESPONSE 2 study. Bruising was reported in 10.3% of \n\npatients treated with ruxolitinib, 8.1% of patients receiving best available therapy in RESPONSE \nstudy and 2.7% of patients receiving best available therapy in RESPONSE 2 study. No intracranial \n\nbleeding or gastrointestinal haemorrhage events were reported in patients receiving ruxolitinib. One \n\npatient treated with ruxolitinib experienced a grade 3 bleeding event (post-procedural bleeding); no \ngrade 4 bleeding was reported. Other bleeding events (including events such as epistaxis, \n\npost-procedural haemorrhage, gingival bleeding) were reported in 8.7% of patients treated with \n\nruxolitinib, 6.3% of patients treated with best available therapy in RESPONSE study and 6.7% of \npatients treated with best available therapy in RESPONSE 2 study. \n\n \n\nDuring the long-term follow-up of phase 3 studies in PV, the cumulative frequency of bleeding events \n\nincreased proportionally to the increase in the follow-up time. Bruising events were the most \n\nfrequently reported bleeding events (17.4%). Intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding events were \n\nreported in 0.3% and 3.5% of patients respectively. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nIn the phase 3 pivotal studies in MF, grade 3 or 4 urinary tract infection was reported in 1.0% of \n\npatients, herpes zoster in 4.3% and tuberculosis in 1.0%. In phase 3 clinical studies sepsis was reported \n\nin 3.0% of patients. An extended follow-up of patients treated with ruxolitinib showed no trends \n\ntowards an increase in the rate of sepsis over time. \n\n \n\nIn the randomised period of the phase 3 studies in PV patients, one (0.5%) CTCAE grade 3 and no \ngrade 4 urinary tract infection was reported. The rate of herpes zoster was similar in PV (4.3%) \n\npatients and MF (4.0%) patients. There was one report of CTCAE grade 3 post-herpetic neuralgia \namongst the PV patients. Pneumonia was reported in 0.5% of patients treated with ruxolitinib \n\ncompared to 1.6% of patients in reference treatments. No patients in the ruxolitinib arm reported \n\nsepsis or tuberculosis. \n\n \n\nDuring long-term follow-up of phase 3 studies in PV, frequently reported infections were urinary tract \n\ninfections (11.8%), herpes zoster (14.7%) and pneumonia (7.1%). Sepsis was reported in 0.6% of \n\npatients. No patients reported tuberculosis in long-term follow-up. \n\n \n\nElevated lipase \n\nIn the randomised period of the RESPONSE study, the worsening of lipase values was higher in the \n\nruxolitinib arm compared to the control arm, mainly due to the differences among grade 1 elevations \n\n(18.2% vs 8.1%). Grade ≥2 elevations were similar between treatment arms. In RESPONSE 2, the \n\nfrequencies were comparable between the ruxolitinib and the control arm (10.8% vs 8%). During long-\n\nterm follow-up of phase 3 PV studies, 7.4% and 0.9% of patients reported grade 3 and grade 4 \n\nelevation of lipase values. No concurrent signs and symptoms of pancreatitis with elevated lipase \n\nvalues were reported in these patients. \n\n \n\nIn phase 3 studies in MF, high lipase values were reported in 18.7% and 19.3% of patients in the \n\nruxolitinib arms compared to 16.6% and 14.0% in the control arms in COMFORT-I and \n\nCOMFORT-II studies, respectively. In patients with elevated lipase values, no concurrent signs and \n\nsymptoms of pancreatitis were reported. \n\n \n\nIncreased systolic blood pressure \n\nIn the phase 3 pivotal clinical studies in MF an increase in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or \n\nmore from baseline was recorded in 31.5% of patients on at least one visit compared with 19.5% of the \n\ncontrol-treated patients. In COMFORT-I (MF patients) the mean increase from baseline in systolic BP \n\nwas 0-2 mmHg on ruxolitinib versus a decrease of 2-5 mmHg in the placebo arm. In COMFORT-II \nmean values showed little difference between the ruxolitinib-treated and the control-treated MF \n\npatients. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nIn the randomised period of the pivotal study in PV patients, the mean systolic blood pressure \n\nincreased by 0.65 mmHg in the ruxolitinib arm versus a decrease of 2 mmHg in the BAT arm. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nThere is no known antidote for overdoses with Jakavi. Single doses up to 200 mg have been given \n\nwith acceptable acute tolerability. Higher than recommended repeat doses are associated with \n\nincreased myelosuppression including leukopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Appropriate \n\nsupportive treatment should be given. \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of ruxolitinib. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE18 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib is a selective inhibitor of the Janus Associated Kinases (JAKs) JAK1 and JAK2 (IC50 \n\nvalues of 3.3 nM and 2.8 nM for JAK1 and JAK2 enzymes, respectively). These mediate the \n\nsignalling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for haematopoiesis and \n\nimmune function. \n\n \n\nMF and PV are myeloproliferative neoplasms known to be associated with dysregulated JAK1 and \n\nJAK2 signalling. The basis for the dysregulation is believed to include high levels of circulating \n\ncytokines that activate the JAK-STAT pathway, gain-of-function mutations such as JAK2V617F, and \n\nsilencing of negative regulatory mechanisms. MF patients exhibit dysregulated JAK signalling \n\nregardless of JAK2V617F mutation status. Activating mutations in JAK2 (V617F or exon 12) are \n\nfound in >95% of PV patients. \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib inhibits JAK-STAT signalling and cell proliferation of cytokine-dependent cellular models \n\nof haematological malignancies, as well as of Ba/F3 cells rendered cytokine-independent by \n\nexpressing the JAK2V617F mutated protein, with IC50 ranging from 80-320 nM. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib inhibits cytokine-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects, \n\nMF patients and PV patients. Ruxolitinib resulted in maximal inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation \n\n2 hours after dosing which returned to near baseline by 8 hours in both healthy subjects and MF \n\npatients, indicating no accumulation of either parent or active metabolites. \n\n \n\nBaseline elevations in inflammatory markers associated with constitutional symptoms such as TNFα, \n\nIL-6 and CRP in subjects with MF were decreased following treatment with ruxolitinib. MF patients \n\ndid not become refractory to the pharmacodynamic effects of ruxolitinib treatment over time. \n\nSimilarly, patients with PV also presented with baseline elevations in inflammatory markers and these \n\nmarkers were decreased following treatment with ruxolitinib. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nIn a thorough QT study in healthy subjects, there was no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of \n\nruxolitinib in single doses up to a supratherapeutic dose of 200 mg, indicating that ruxolitinib has no \n\neffect on cardiac repolarisation. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nMyelofibrosis \n\nTwo randomised phase 3 studies (COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II) were conducted in patients with \n\nMF (primary MF, post-polycythaemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythaemia MF). In both \n\nstudies, patients had palpable splenomegaly at least 5 cm below the costal margin and risk category of \n\nintermediate-2 or high risk based on the International Working Group (IWG) Consensus Criteria. The \n\nstarting dose of Jakavi was based on platelet count. \n\n \n\nCOMFORT-I was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in 309 patients who were \n\nrefractory to or were not candidates for available therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was \n\nproportion of subjects achieving ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at week 24 as \n\nmeasured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT). \n\n \n\nSecondary endpoints included duration of maintenance of a ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen \n\nvolume, proportion of patients who had ≥50% reduction in total symptom score, changes in total \n\nsymptom scores from baseline to week 24, as measured by the modified MF Symptom Assessment \n\nForm (MFSAF) v2.0 diary, and overall survival. \n\n \n\nCOMFORT-II was an open-label, randomised study in 219 patients. Patients were randomised 2:1 to \n\nruxolitinib versus best available therapy. In the best available therapy arm, 47% of patients received \n\nhydroxyurea and 16% of patients received glucocorticoids. The primary efficacy endpoint was \n\nproportion of patients achieving ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at week 48 as \n\nmeasured by MRI or CT. \n\n \n\nSecondary endpoints included proportion of patients achieving a ≥35% reduction of spleen volume \n\nfrom baseline at week 24 and duration of maintenance of a ≥35% reduction from baseline spleen \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nIn COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II, patient baseline demographics and disease characteristics were \n\ncomparable between the treatment arms. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Percentage of patients with ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at \n\nweek 24 in COMFORT-I and at week 48 in COMFORT-II (ITT) \n\n \n\n COMFORT-I COMFORT-II \n\n Jakavi \n\n(N=155) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N=153) \n\nJakavi \n\n(N=144) \n\nBest available \n\ntherapy \n\n(N=72) \n\nTime points Week 24 Week 48 \n\nNumber (%) of subjects \n\nwith spleen volume \n\nreduced by ≥35% \n\n65 (41.9) 1 (0.7) 41 (28.5) 0 \n\n95% confidence intervals 34.1, 50.1 0, 3.6 21.3, 36.6 0.0, 5.0 \n\np-value <0.0001 <0.0001 \n\n \n\nA significantly higher proportion of patients in the Jakavi group achieved ≥35% reduction from \n\nbaseline in spleen volume (Table 2) regardless of the presence or absence of the JAK2V617F mutation \n\nor the disease subtype (primary MF, post-polycythaemia vera MF, post-essential thrombocythaemia \n\nMF). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 3 Percentage of patients with ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume by JAK \n\nmutation status (safety set) \n\n \n\n COMFORT-I COMFORT-II \n\n Jakavi Placebo Jakavi Best available \n\ntherapy \n\nJAK \n\nmutation \n\nstatus \n\nPositive \n\n(N=113) \n\nn (%) \n\nNegative \n\n(N=40) \n\nn (%) \n\nPositive \n\n(N=121) \n\nn (%) \n\nNegative \n\n(N=27) \n\nn (%) \n\nPositive \n\n(N=110) \n\nn (%) \n\nNegative \n\n(N=35) \n\nn (%) \n\nPositive \n\n(N=49) \n\nn (%) \n\nNegative \n\n(N=20) \n\nn (%) \n\nNumber \n\n(%) of \n\nsubjects \n\nwith \n\nspleen \n\nvolume \n\nreduced by \n\n≥35% \n\n54 \n\n(47.8) \n\n11 \n\n(27.5) \n\n1 \n\n(0.8) \n\n0 36 \n\n(32.7) \n\n5 \n\n(14.3) \n\n0 0 \n\nTime point After 24 weeks After 48 weeks \n\n \n\nThe probability of maintaining spleen response (≥35% reduction) on Jakavi for at least 24 weeks was \n\n89% in COMFORT-I and 87% in COMFORT-II; 52% maintained spleen responses for at least \n\n48 weeks in COMFORT-II. \n\n \n\nIn COMFORT-I, 45.9% subjects in the Jakavi group achieved a ≥50% improvement from baseline in \n\nthe week 24 total symptom score (measured using MFSAF diary v2.0), as compared to 5.3% in the \n\nplacebo group (p<0.0001 using chi-square test). The mean change in the global health status at \n\nweek 24, as measured by EORTC QLQ C30 was +12.3 for Jakavi and -3.4 for placebo (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nIn COMFORT-I, after a median follow-up of 34.3 months, the death rate in patients randomised to the \n\nruxolitinib arm was 27.1% versus 35.1% in patients randomised to placebo; HR 0.687; 95% CI \n\n0.459-1.029; p=0.0668. \n\n \n\nIn COMFORT-I, after a median follow–up of 61.7 months, the death rate in patients randomised to the \n\nruxolitinib arm was 44.5% (69 of 155 patients) versus 53.2% (82 of 154) in patients randomised to \n\nplacebo. There was a 31% reduction in the risk of death in the ruxolitinib arm as compared to placebo \n\n(HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p=0.025). \n\n \n\nIn COMFORT-II, after a median follow-up of 34.7 months, the death rate in patients randomised to \n\nruxolitinib was 19.9% versus 30.1% in patients randomised to best available treatment (BAT); HR \n\n0.48; 95% CI 0.28-0.85; p=0.009. In both studies, the lower death rates noted in the ruxolitinib arm \n\nwere predominantly driven by the results obtained in the post polycythaemia vera and post essential \n\nthrombocythaemia subgroups. \n\n \n\nIn COMFORT-II, after a median follow-up of 55.9 months, the death rate in patients randomised to \n\nthe ruxolitinib arm was 40.4% (59 of 146 patients) versus 47.9% (35 of 73 patients) in patients \n\nrandomized to best available therapy (BAT). There was a 33% reduction in risk of death in the \n\nruxolitinib arm compared to the BAT arm (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.44-1.02; p=0.062). \n\n \n\nPolycythaemia vera \n\nA randomised, open-label, active-controlled phase 3 study (RESPONSE) was conducted in \n\n222 patients with PV who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea defined based on the \n\nEuropean LeukemiaNet (ELN) international working group published criteria. 110 patients were \n\nrandomised to the ruxolitinib arm and 112 patients to the BAT arm. The starting dose of Jakavi was \n\n10 mg twice daily. Doses were then adjusted in individual patients based on tolerability and efficacy \n\nwith a maximum dose of 25 mg twice daily. BAT was selected by the investigator on a patient-by-\n\npatient basis and included hydroxyurea (59.5%), interferon/pegylated interferon (11.7%), anagrelide \n\n(7.2%), pipobroman (1.8%) and observation (15.3%). \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nBaseline demographics and disease characteristics were comparable between the two treatments arms. \n\nThe median age was 60 years (range 33 to 90 years). Patients in the ruxolitinib arm had PV diagnosis \n\nfor a median of 8.2 years and had previously received hydroxyurea for a median of approximately \n\n3 years. Most patients (>80%) had received at least two phlebotomies in the last 24 weeks prior to \n\nscreening. Comparative data regarding long-term survival and incidence of disease complications is \n\nmissing. \n\n \n\nThe primary composite endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving both an absence of \n\nphlebotomy eligibility (HCT control) and a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline at \n\nweek 32. Phlebotomy eligibility was defined as a confirmed HCT of >45%, i.e. at least 3 percentage \n\npoints higher than the HCT obtained at baseline or a confirmed HCT of >48%, depending on which \n\nwas lower. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved the primary \n\nendpoint and remained free from progression at week 48, as well as the proportion of patients \n\nachieving complete haematological remission at week 32. \n\n \n\nThe study met its primary objective and a higher proportion of patients in the Jakavi group achieved \n\nthe primary composite endpoint and each of its individual components. Significantly more patients \n\ntreated with Jakavi (23%) achieved a primary response (p<0.0001) compared to BAT (0.9%). \n\nHaematocrit control was achieved in 60% of patients in the Jakavi arm compared to 18.8% in the BAT \n\narm and a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume was achieved in 40% of patients in the Jakavi arm \n\ncompared to 0.9% in the BAT arm (Figure 1). \n\n \n\nBoth key secondary endpoints were also met. The proportion of patients achieving a complete \n\nhaematological remission was 23.6% on Jakavi compared to 8.0% on BAT (p=0.0013) and the \n\nproportion of patients achieving a durable primary response at week 48 was 20% on Jakavi and 0.9% \n\non BAT (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Patients achieving the primary endpoint and components of the primary endpoint at \n\nweek 32 \n\n \n \n\nSymptom burden was assessed using the MPN-SAF total symptom score (TSS) electronic patient \n\ndiary, which consisted of 14 questions. At week 32, 49% and 64% of patients treated with ruxolitinib \n\nachieved a ≥50% reduction in TSS-14 and TSS-5, respectively, compared to only 5% and 11% of \n\npatients on BAT. \n\n \n\n  \n\n23\n\n40\n\n60\n\n1 1\n\n19\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nPrimary composite endpoint at\nweek 32\n\n≥35% reduction in spleen \nvolume\n\nHaematocrit control without\nphlebotomy\n\nP\ner\n\nce\nn\n\nta\nge\n\n e\n o\n\nf \np\n\nat\nie\n\nn\nts\n\n.RUX\n\n.BAT\n\nP value: < .0001\nOdds ratio (ruxolitinib/BAT) \n\nand 95% CI: \n32.67 (5.04, 1337)\n\nIndividual components of primary \nresponse at week 32\n\n\n\n19 \n\nTreatment benefit perception was measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) \n\nquestionnaire. 66% of patients treated with ruxolitinib compared to 19% treated with BAT reported an \n\nimprovement as early as four weeks after beginning treatment.

The primary endpoint defined as the proportion of patients achieving HCT control \n\n(absence of phlebotomy eligibility) at week 28 was met (62.2% in the Jakavi arm versus 18.7% in the \n\nBAT arm). The key secondary endpoint defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete \n\nhaematological remission at week 28 was also met (23.0% in the Jakavi arm versus 5.3% in the BAT \n\narm). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Jakavi \n\nin all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of MF and PV (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class 1 compound, with high \n\npermeability, high solubility and rapid dissolution characteristics. In clinical studies, ruxolitinib is \n\nrapidly absorbed after oral administration with maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) achieved \n\napproximately 1 hour post-dose. Based on a human mass balance study, oral absorption of ruxolitinib, \n\nas ruxolitinib or metabolites formed under first-pass, is 95% or greater. Mean ruxolitinib Cmax and total \n\nexposure (AUC) increased proportionally over a single dose range of 5-200 mg. There was no \n\nclinically relevant change in the pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib upon administration with a high-fat \n\nmeal. The mean Cmax was moderately decreased (24%) while the mean AUC was nearly unchanged \n\n(4% increase) on dosing with a high-fat meal. \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 75 litres in MF and PV patients. At \n\nclinically relevant concentrations of ruxolitinib, binding to plasma proteins in vitro is approximately \n\n97%, mostly to albumin. A whole body autoradiography study in rats has shown that ruxolitinib does \n\nnot penetrate the blood-brain barrier. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 (>50%), with additional contribution from CYP2C9. \n\nParent compound is the predominant entity in human plasma, representing approximately 60% of the \n\ndrug-related material in circulation. Two major and active metabolites are present in plasma \n\nrepresenting 25% and 11% of parent AUC. These metabolites have one half to one fifth of the parent \n\nJAK-related pharmacological activity. The sum total of all active metabolites contributes to 18% of \n\nthe overall pharmacodynamics of ruxolitinib. At clinically relevant concentrations, ruxolitinib does not \n\ninhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 and is not a potent \n\ninducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 based on in vitro studies. In vitro data indicate that \n\nruxolitinib may inhibit P-gp and BCRP. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib is mainly eliminated through metabolism. The mean elimination half-life of ruxolitinib is \n\napproximately 3 hours. Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled ruxolitinib in healthy adult \n\nsubjects, elimination was predominately through metabolism, with 74% of radioactivity excreted in \n\nurine and 22% via faeces. Unchanged parent substance accounted for less than 1% of the excreted \n\ntotal radioactivity. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nDose proportionality was demonstrated in the single and multiple dose studies. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nEffects of age, gender or race \n\nBased on studies in healthy subjects, no relevant differences in ruxolitinib pharmacokinetics were \n\nobserved with regard to gender and race. In a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in MF patients, \n\nno relationship was apparent between oral clearance and patient age or race. The predicted oral \n\nclearance was 17.7 l/h in women and 22.1 l/h in men, with 39% inter-subject variability in MF \n\npatients. Clearance was 12.7 l/h in PV patients, with a 42% inter-subject variability and no relationship \n\nwas apparent between oral clearance and gender, patient age or race, based on a population \n\npharmacokinetic evaluation in PV patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Jakavi in paediatric patients have not been established (see section 5.1, \n\n“Paediatric population”). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nRenal function was determined using both Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and urinary \n\ncreatinine. Following a single ruxolitinib dose of 25 mg, the exposure of ruxolitinib was similar in \n\nsubjects with various degrees of renal impairment and in those with normal renal function. However, \n\nplasma AUC values of ruxolitinib metabolites tended to increase with increasing severity of renal \n\nimpairment, and were most markedly increased in the subjects with severe renal impairment. It is \n\nunknown whether the increased metabolite exposure is of safety concern. A dose modification is \n\nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease (see section 4.2). \n\nDosing only on dialysis days reduces the metabolite exposure, but also the pharmacodynamic effect, \n\nespecially on the days between dialysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nFollowing a single ruxolitinib dose of 25 mg in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, \n\nthe mean AUC for ruxolitinib was increased in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic \n\nimpairment by 87%, 28% and 65%, respectively, compared to patients with normal hepatic function. \n\nThere was no clear relationship between AUC and the degree of hepatic impairment based on \n\nChild-Pugh scores. The terminal elimination half-life was prolonged in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment compared to healthy controls (4.1-5.0 hours versus 2.8 hours). A dose reduction of \n\napproximately 50% is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and \n\nreproductive toxicity studies and in a carcinogenicity study. Target organs associated with the \n\npharmacological action of ruxolitinib in repeated dose studies include bone marrow, peripheral blood \n\nand lymphoid tissues. Infections generally associated with immunosuppression were noted in dogs. \n\nAdverse decreases in blood pressure along with increases in heart rate were noted in a dog telemetry \n\nstudy, and an adverse decrease in minute volume was noted in a respiratory study in rats. The margins \n\n(based on unbound Cmax) at the non-adverse level in the dog and rat studies were 15.7-fold and \n\n10.4-fold greater, respectively, than the maximum human recommended dose of 25 mg twice daily. \n\nNo effects were noted in an evaluation of the neuropharmacological effects of ruxolitinib. \n\n \n\nIn juvenile rat studies, administration of ruxolitinib resulted in effects on growth and bone measures. \n\nReduced bone growth was observed at doses ≥5 mg/kg/day when treatment started on postnatal day 7 \n\n(comparable to human newborn) and at ≥15 mg/kg/day when treatment started on postnatal days 14 or \n\n21 (comparable to human infant, 1–3 years). Fractures and early termination of rats were observed at \n\ndoses ≥30 mg/kg/day when treatment was started on postnatal day 7. Based on unbound AUC, the \n\nexposure at the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) in juvenile rats treated as early as postnatal \n\nday 7 was 0.3-fold that of adult patients at 25 mg twice daily, while reduced bone growth and fractures \n\noccurred at exposures that were 1.5- and 13-fold that of adult patients at 25 mg twice daily, \n\nrespectively. The effects were generally more severe when administration was initiated earlier in the \n\npostnatal period. Other than bone development, the effects of ruxolitinib in juvenile rats were similar \n\nto those in adult rats. Juvenile rats are more sensitive than adult rats to ruxolitinib toxicity. \n\n \n\nRuxolitinib decreased foetal weight and increased post-implantation loss in animal studies. There was \n\nno evidence of a teratogenic effect in rats and rabbits. However, the exposure margins compared to the \n\nhighest clinical dose were low and the results are therefore of limited relevance for humans. No effects \n\nwere noted on fertility. In a pre- and post-natal development study, a slightly prolonged gestation \n\nperiod, reduced number of implantation sites, and reduced number of pups delivered were observed. In \n\nthe pups, decreased mean initial body weights and short period of decreased mean body weight gain \n\nwere observed. In lactating rats, ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk with a \n\nconcentration that was 13-fold higher than the maternal plasma concentration. Ruxolitinib was not \n\nmutagenic or clastogenic. Ruxolitinib was not carcinogenic in the Tg.rasH2 transgenic mouse model. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Jakavi is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Jakavi \n\n3. How to take Jakavi \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Jakavi \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Jakavi is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nJakavi contains the active substance ruxolitinib. \n\n \n\nJakavi is used to treat adult patients with an enlarged spleen or with symptoms related to \n\nmyelofibrosis, a rare form of blood cancer. \n\n \n\nJakavi is also used to treat patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of \n\nhydroxyurea. \n\n \n\nHow Jakavi works \n\nEnlargement of the spleen is one of the characteristics of myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is a disorder of \n\nthe bone marrow, in which the marrow is replaced by scar tissue. The abnormal marrow can no longer \n\nproduce enough normal blood cells and as a result the spleen becomes significantly enlarged. By \n\nblocking the action of certain enzymes (called Janus Associated Kinases), Jakavi can reduce the size \n\nof the spleen in patients with myelofibrosis and relieve symptoms such as fever, night sweats, bone \n\npain and weight loss in patients with myelofibrosis. Jakavi can help reduce the risk of serious blood or \n\nvascular complications. \n\n \n\nPolycythaemia vera is a disorder of the bone marrow, in which the marrow produce too many red \n\nblood cells. The blood becomes thicker as a result of the increased red blood cells. Jakavi can relieve \n\nthe symptoms, reduce spleen size and the volume of red blood cells produced in patients with \n\npolycythaemia vera by selectively blocking enzymes called Janus Associated Kinases (JAK1 and \n\nJAK2), thus potentially reducing the risk of serious blood or vascular complications. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Jakavi works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \n\nask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Jakavi \n\n \n\nFollow all the doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained \n\nin this leaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not take Jakavi \n- if you are allergic to ruxolitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n\nIf either of the above applies to you, tell your doctor who will then decide whether you should start \n\ntreatment with Jakavi. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jakavi \n\n- if you have any infections. It may be necessary to treat your infection before starting Jakavi. It is \nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis or if you have been in close \n\ncontact with someone who has or has had tuberculosis. Your doctor may perform tests to see if \n\nyou have tuberculosis or any other infections. It is important that you tell your doctor if you \n\nhave ever had hepatitis B. \n\n- if you have any kidney problems. Your doctor may need to prescribe a different dose of Jakavi. \n- if you have or have ever had any liver problems. Your doctor may need to prescribe a different \n\ndose of Jakavi. \n\n- if you are taking other medicines (see section “Other medicines and Jakavi”). \n- if you have ever had tuberculosis. \n- if you have ever had skin cancer. \n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist during your treatment with Jakavi \n- if you experience unexpected bruising and/or bleeding, unusual tiredness, shortness of breath \n\nduring exercise or at rest, unusually pale skin, or frequent infections (these are signs of blood \n\ndisorders). \n\n- if you experience fever, chills or other symptoms of infections. \n- if you experience chronic coughing with blood-tinged sputum, fever, night sweats and weight \n\nloss (these can be signs of tuberculosis). \n\n- if you have any of the following symptoms or if anyone close to you notices that you have any \nof these symptoms: confusion or difficulty thinking, loss of balance or difficulty walking, \n\nclumsiness, difficulty speaking, decreased strength or weakness on one side of your body, \n\nblurred and/or loss of vision. These may be signs of a serious brain infection and your doctor \n\nmay suggest further testing and follow-up. \n\n- if you develop painful skin rash with blisters (these are signs of shingles). \n- if you notice skin changes. This may require further observation, as certain types of skin cancer \n\n(non-melanoma) have been reported. \n\n \n\nBlood tests \n\nBefore you start treatment with Jakavi, your doctor will perform blood tests to determine the best \n\nstarting dose for you. You will need to have further blood tests during treatment so that your doctor \n\ncan monitor the amount of blood cells (white cells, red cells and platelets) in your body and assess \n\nhow you are responding to the treatment and whether Jakavi is having an unwanted effect on these \n\ncells. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose or stop treatment. Your doctor will carefully check if \n\nyou have any signs or symptoms of infection before starting and during your treatment with Jakavi. \n\nYour doctor will also regularly check the level of lipids (fat) in your blood. \n\n \n\nStopping Jakavi \n\nWhen you stop taking Jakavi, the myelofibrosis symptoms may come back. Your doctor may want to \n\ngradually reduce the amount of Jakavi taken each day, before stopping it completely. \n\n  \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThis medicine is not intended for use by children or adolescents aged below 18 years because it has \n\nnot been studied in this age group. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Jakavi \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nIt is particularly important that you mention any of the following medicines containing any of the \n\nfollowing active substances, as your doctor may need to adjust the Jakavi dose for you. \n\n \n\nThe following may increase the risk of side effects with Jakavi: \n\n- Some medicines used to treat infections. These include medicines used to treat fungal diseases \n(such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole), medicines \n\nused to treat certain types of bacterial infections (antibiotics such as clarithromycin, \n\ntelithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin), medicines to treat viral infections, including \n\nHIV infection/AIDS (such as amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, \n\nritonavir, saquinavir), medicines to treat hepatitis C (boceprevir, telaprevir). \n\n- Nefazodone, a medicine to treat depression. \n- Mibefradil or diltiazem, medicines to treat hypertension and chronic angina pectoris. \n- Cimetidine, a medicine to treat heartburn. \n \n\nThe following may reduce the effectiveness of Jakavi: \n\n- Avasimibe, a medicine to treat heart disease. \n- Phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital and other anti-epileptics used to stop seizures or \n\nfits. \n\n- Rifabutin or rifampicin, medicines used to treat tuberculosis (TB). \n- St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used to treat depression. \n \n\nWhile you are taking Jakavi you should never start a new medicine without checking first with the \n\ndoctor who prescribed Jakavi.

If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance \n\nto some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n  \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Jakavi \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe dose of Jakavi depends on the patient’s blood cell count. Your doctor will measure the amount of \n\nblood cells in your body and find the best dose for you, particularly if you have liver or kidney \n\nproblems. \n\n- The recommended starting dose in myelofibrosis is 15 mg twice daily or 20 mg twice daily, \ndepending on your blood cell count. \n\n- The recommended starting dose in polycythaemia vera is 10 mg twice daily. \n- The maximum dose is 25 mg twice daily. \n \n\nYour doctor will always tell you exactly how many Jakavi tablets to take. \n\n \n\nDuring the treatment your doctor may recommend a lower or higher dose to you if the results of blood \n\ntests show that this is necessary, if you have problems with your liver or kidneys, or if you also need \n\ntreatment with certain other medicines. \n\n \n\nIf you receive dialysis, take either one single dose or two separate doses of Jakavi only on dialysis \n\ndays, after the dialysis has been completed. Your doctor will tell you if you should take one or two \n\ndoses and how many tablets to take for each dose. \n\n \n\nYou should take Jakavi every day at the same time, either with or without food. \n\n \n\nYou should continue taking Jakavi for as long as your doctor tells you to. This is a long-term \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will regularly monitor your condition to make sure that the treatment is having the desired \n\neffect. \n\n \n\nIf you have questions about how long to take Jakavi, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you experience certain side effects (e.g. blood disorders), your doctor might need to change the \n\namount of Jakavi you have to take or tell you to stop taking Jakavi for a while. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Jakavi than you should \n\nIf you accidentally take more Jakavi than your doctor prescribed, contact your doctor or pharmacist \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Jakavi \n\nIf you forgot to take Jakavi simply take your next dose at the scheduled time. Do not take a double \n\ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Jakavi \n\nIf you interrupt your treatment with Jakavi your myelofibrosis-related symptoms may come back. \n\nTherefore, you should not stop taking Jakavi without discussing it with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n  \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
