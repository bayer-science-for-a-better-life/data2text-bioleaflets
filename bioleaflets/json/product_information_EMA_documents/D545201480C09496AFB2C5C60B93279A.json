NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTasermity 800 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 800 mg sevelamer hydrochloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \nThe off-white, oval tablets are imprinted with “SH800” on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTasermity is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving \nhaemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Sevelamer hydrochloride should be used within the context of a \nmultiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 \nor one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nStarting dose \nThe recommended starting dose of sevelamer hydrochloride is 2.4 g or 4.8 g per day based on clinical \nneeds and serum phosphorus level. Sevelamer hydrochloride must be taken three times per day with \nmeals. \n \nSerum phosphate level in patients not on \n\nphosphate binders \nStarting dose of Sevelamer \n\nhydrochloride 800 mg tablets \n1.76 – 2.42 mmol/L (5.5-7.5 mg/dl) 1 tablet, 3 times per day \n\n> 2.42 mmol/L (>7.5 mg/dl) 2 tablets, 3 times per day \n \nFor patients previously on phosphate binders, Sevelamer hydrochloride should be given on a gram for \ngram basis with monitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses. \n \nTitration and maintenance \nSerum phosphate levels should be closely monitored and the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride titrated \nby 0.8 g three times per day (2.4 g/day) increments with the goal of lowering serum phosphate to 1.76 \nmmol/L (5.5 mg/dl) or less. Serum phosphate should be tested every two to three weeks until a stable \nserum phosphate level is reached and on a regular basis thereafter. \n \nThe dose range may vary between 1 and 5 tablets of 800 mg per meal. The average actual daily dose \nused in the chronic phase of a one year clinical study was 7 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of this product have not been established in patients below the age of \n18 years.  \n \nRenal impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of this product have not been established in predialysis patients.  \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use \nPatients should take sevelamer hydrochloride with meals and adhere to their prescribed diets. The \ntablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to administration. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to sevelamer or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Hypophosphataemia \n• Bowel obstruction. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEfficacy and safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with: \n\n• swallowing disorders \n• active inflammatory bowel disease \n• gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, diverticulosis, \n\nretention of gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion \n• patients with a history of major gastrointestinal surgery \n\n \nTherefore caution should be exercised when sevelamer hydrochloride is used in patients with these \ndisorders. \n \nIntestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus \nIn very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during \ntreatment with sevelamer hydrochloride. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are \nconstipated should be monitored carefully while being treated with sevelamer hydrochloride. \nSevelamer hydrochloride treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe \nconstipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. \n \nFat-soluble vitamins \nDepending on diet intake and the nature of end stage renal failure, dialysis patients may develop low \nvitamin A, D, E and K levels. It cannot be excluded that sevelamer hydrochloride can bind fat-soluble \nvitamins contained in ingested food. Therefore, in patients not taking these vitamins, monitoring \nvitamin A, D and E levels and assessing vitamin K status through the measurement of thromboplastin \ntime should be considered and the vitamins should be supplemented if necessary. Additional \nmonitoring of vitamins and folic acid is recommended in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, since \nin the clinical study, vitamin A, D, E and K levels were not measured in these patients. \n \nFolate deficiency \nThere is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term \nsevelamer hydrochloride treatment. \n \nHypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia \nPatients with renal insufficiency may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Sevelamer \nhydrochloride does not contain calcium. Serum calcium levels should be monitored as is done in \nnormal follow-up of a dialysis patient. Elemental calcium should be given as a supplement in case of \nhypocalcaemia.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nMetabolic acidosis \nPatients with chronic renal failure are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis.  Worsening of \nacidosis has been reported upon switching from other phosphate binders to sevelamer in a number of \nstudies where lower bicarbonate levels in the sevelamer-treated patients compared to patients treated \nwith calcium-based binders were observed.  Closer monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is \ntherefore recommended. \n \nPeritonitis \nPatients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to the dialysis modality. \nPeritonitis is a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) and in a clinical \nstudy with sevelamer hydrochloride, a number of peritonitis cases were reported. Therefore, patients \non PD should be closely monitored to ensure the reliable use of appropriate aseptic technique with the \nprompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis. \n \nSwallowing and choking difficulties \nUncommon reports of difficulty swallowing the sevelamer hydrochloride tablet have been reported.  \nMany of these cases involved patients with co-morbid conditions including swallowing disorders or \noesophageal abnormalities.  Caution should be exercised when sevelamer hydrochloride is used in \npatients with difficulty swallowing. \n \nHypothyroidism \nCloser monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride and \nlevothyroxine is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLong term chronic treatment \nAs data on the chronic use of sevelamer hydrochloride for over one year are not yet available, \npotential absorption and accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment cannot be \ntotally excluded (see section 5.2). \n \nHyperparathyroidism \nSevelamer hydrochloride alone is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. In patients \nwith secondary hyperparathyroidism sevelamer hydrochloride should be used within the context of a \nmultiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 \nor one of its analogues to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. \n \nSerum chloride \nSerum chloride may increase during sevelamer hydrochloride treatment as chloride may be exchanged \nfor phosphorus in the intestinal lumen. Although no clinically significant serum chloride increase has \nbeen observed in the clinical studies, serum chloride should be monitored as is done in the routine \nfollow-up of a dialysis patient. One gram of sevelamer hydrochloride contains approximately 180 mg \n(5.1 mEq) chloride. \n \nInflammatory Gastrointestinal Disorders  \nCases of serious inflammatory disorders of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (including \nserious complications such as bleeding, perforation, ulceration, necrosis, colitis, …) associated with \nthe presence of sevelamer crystals have been reported in literature. However, the causality of the \nsevelamer crystals in initiating such disorders has not been demonstrated. Sevelamer hydrochloride \ntreatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDialysis \nInteraction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis. \n \nCiprofloxacin \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride decreased the bioavailability of \nciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride in a single \ndose study. Consequently, sevelamer hydrochloride should not be taken simultaneously with \nciprofloxacin. \n \nAnti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products \nPatients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure \nmedicinal products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing sevelamer hydrochloride to patients also taking these medicinal \nproducts. \n \nLevothyroxine \nDuring post marketing experience, very rare cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) \nlevels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. \nCloser monitoring of TSH levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving both medicinal \nproducts. \n \nCiclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients \nReduced levels of ciclosporin,  mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in \ntransplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical \nconsequences (i.e graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close \nmonitoring of blood concentrations of mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be \nconsidered during the use of combination and after its withdrawal.  \n \nDigoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol  \nIn interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride had no effect on the \nbioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. \n \nProton pump inhibitors \nDuring post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in \npatients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride.  \n \nBioavailability \nSevelamer hydrochloride is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal \nproducts. When administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could \nhave a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered \nat least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer hydrochloride, or the physician should consider \nmonitoring blood levels. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThe safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in pregnant women. In animal studies \nthere was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryo-foetal toxicity. Sevelamer hydrochloride should \nonly be given to pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been \nconducted for both the mother and the foetus (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nThe safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in breast-feeding women. Sevelamer \nhydrochloride should only be given to breast-feeding women if clearly needed and after a careful \nrisk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both the mother and the infant (see section 5.3). \n \nFertility \nThere are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown \nthat sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n2 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative body surface \narea. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSevelamer hydrochloride has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently occurring (≥5% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal \ndisorders system organ class.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn parallel design studies involving 244 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of up to 54 \nweeks and 97 peritoneal dialysis patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks were conducted \nAdverse reactions from these studies (299 patients),  from uncontrolled clinical trials (384 patients) \nand that were spontaneously reported from post-marketing experience are listed by frequency in the \ntable below. The reporting rate is classified as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Very Rare Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Hypersensitivity*  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Acidosis, \nincreased \nserum \nchloride \nlevels \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, \nvomiting \n\nDiarrhoea, \ndyspepsia, \nflatulence, \nupper \nabdominal \npain, \nconstipation \n\n  Abdominal \npain, intestinal \nobstruction, \nileus/subileus, \ndiverticulitis, \nintestinal \nperforation \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n    Pruritus, rash \n\n*post-marketing experience \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSevelamer hydrochloride has been given to normal healthy volunteers in doses up to 14 grams, the \nequivalent of seventeen 800 mg tablets, per day for eight days with no undesirable effects.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Treatment of hyperphosphatemia. ATC code: V03AE02. \n \nTasermity contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding poly (allylamine hydrochloride) \npolymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the \npolymer backbone. These amines become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with \nphosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the \ngastrointestinal tract, sevelamer lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum. \n \nIn clinical trials, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to be effective in reducing serum \nphosphorus in patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nSevelamer decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to patients using calcium \nbased phosphate binders alone, probably because the product itself does not contain calcium. The \neffects on phosphate and calcium were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year \nfollow-up. \n \nSevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile \nacid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In \nclinical trials mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%. This effect is observed after \n2 weeks is maintained with long-term treatment. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not \nchange.  \n \nIn the clinical studies in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer hydrochloride alone did not have a \nconsistent and clinically significant effect on serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). In the \n12 week study involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH reductions were seen \ncompared with patients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism \nsevelamer hydrochloride should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which \ncould include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the \niPTH levels. \n \nIn a clinical trial of one-year duration, sevelamer hydrochloride had no adverse effect on bone \nturnover or mineralisation compared to calcium carbonate.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSevelamer hydrochloride   is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract according to a single dose \npharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out in \nrenal failure patients (see section 4.4).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer at a dose of 10 times the maximum human doses \nreduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K, and folic acid. \n \nIn a study in rats, administering sevelamer in 15-30 x the human dose, an increase in serum copper \nwas detected. This was not confirmed in a dog study or in clinical trials. \nCurrently, no formal carcinogenicity data are available. However, in vitro and in vivo studies have \nindicated that sevelamer  does not have genotoxic potential. Also the medicinal product is not \nabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nIn reproduction studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryolethality, foetotoxicity \nor teratogenicity at the doses tested (up to 1 g/kg/day in rabbits and up to 4.5 g/kg/day in rats). \nDeficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in fetuses of female rats dosed with \nsevelamer at 8-20 times the maximum human dose of 200 mg/kg. The effects may be secondary to \nvitamin D and/or vitamin K depletion at these high doses. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Tasermity is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Tasermity \n3. How to take Tasermity \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tasermity \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tasermity is and what it is used for  \n \nTasermity contains sevelamer as the active ingredient. It binds phosphate from food in the digestive \ntract and so reduces serum phosphate levels in the blood. \n \nTasermity is used to control the levels of phosphate in the blood of adult kidney failure patients on \nhaemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment.  \n \nAdult patients whose kidneys have failed and who are undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis \nare not able to control the level of serum phosphate in their blood. The amount of phosphate then rises \n(your doctor will call this hyperphosphataemia). Increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to \nhard deposits in your body called calcification. These deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and \nmake it harder for blood to be pumped around the body. Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to \nitchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. \n \nTasermity may be used with other medicines which include calcium or vitamin D supplements to \ncontrol the development of renal bone disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tasermity \n \nDo not take Tasermity: \n• if you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you). \n• if you have bowel obstruction.  \n• if you are allergic to sevelamer or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection  6). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Tasermity if any of the following applies to you: \n\n• if you are not on dialysis \n• if you have swallowing problems \n• if you have problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel \n• if you have symptoms of delayed emptying of stomach contents such as feeling of fullness, \n\nnausea and/or vomiting \n• if you have prolonged diarrhoea or pain in the abdomen (symptoms of active inflammatory \n\nbowel disease) \n• if you have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel. \n\n \nAdditional treatments: \nDue to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: \n\n• develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood. Since Tasermity does not contain \ncalcium your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. \n\n• have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels \nof vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take \nmultivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid \nin your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental \nvitamins as necessary. \n\n \nChanging treatment: \nWhen you switch from another phosphate binder to Tasermity, your doctor might consider monitoring \nthe levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Tasermity may decrease the levels of \nbicarbonate. \n \nSpecial note for patients on peritoneal dialysis: \nYou may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal \ndialysis. This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You \nshould tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal \ndistress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, \nconstipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.  \nYou should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, \nK and folic acid. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) have not been studied. Therefore \nTasermity is not recommended for use in this population. \n \nOther medicines and Tasermity \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \n\n• Tasermity should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). \n \n\n• If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult \nyour doctor before taking Tasermity. \n\n \n• The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus \n\n(medicines used in transplant patients) may be reduced by Tasermity. Your doctor will advise \nyou if you are taking these medicines. \n\n \n• In certain people taking levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and Tasermity, increased levels of \n\nthyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, a substance in your blood which helps control your \nbody’s chemical functions) may very rarely be observed. Therefore your doctor may monitor \nthe levels of TSH in your blood more closely. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n• If you are taking medicine such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole to treat heartburn, \n\ngastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or gastric ulcers, you should consult your doctor when \ntaking Tasermity. \n\n \nYour doctor will check for interactions between Tasermity and other medicines on a regular basis. \n \nIn some cases where Tasermity should be taken at the same time as another medicine, your doctor \nmay advise you to take this medicine 1 hour before or 3 hours after Tasermity intake, or he/she may \nconsider monitoring the blood levels of that medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nThe safety of Tasermity has not been established in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Tasermity \nshould only be given to pregnant or breast-feeding women if clearly needed. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTasermity is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines.  \n \n \n3. How to take Tasermity \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. He/she will base the dose on your serum phosphate level. The recommended starting dose of \nTasermity for adults and the elderly (> 65 years) is one or two tablets with each meal 3 times a day.  \n \nInitially your doctor will check the levels of phosphate in your blood every 2-3 weeks and may adjust \nthe dose of Tasermity when necessary (between 1 and 5 tablets of 800 mg per meal) to reach an \nadequate phosphate level. \n \nThe tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to swallowing. \n \nPatients taking Tasermity should adhere to their prescribed diet and liquid intake.  \n \nIf you take more Tasermity than you should \nIn the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Tasermity \nIf you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the \nusual time with a meal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSince constipation may be a preceding symptom in very rare cases of blockages in your intestine, it is \nimportant to inform your doctor or pharmacist of this symptom before or during the use of Tasermity. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported in patients taking Tasermity:  \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  \nnausea, vomiting \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \ndiarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \nincreased acidity of the blood.  \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10000 people): \nhypersensitivity. \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \ncases of itching, rash, abdominal pain, slow intestine motility (movement), blockages in the intestine, \ninflammation of abnormal small pouches (called diverticula) in the large intestine and perforation in \nthe intestine wall have been reported. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix \nV. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Tasermity  \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date stated on the bottle after “EXP”. The expiry date refers \nto the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store this medicine above 25 °C. Keep the bottle tightly closed in order to protect from \nmoisture.  \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.
