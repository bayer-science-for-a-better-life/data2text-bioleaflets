NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nScintimun 1 mg kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial of Scintimun contains 1 mg of besilesomab. \n \nBesilesomab is an anti-granulocyte monoclonal antibody (BW 250/183), produced in murine cells.  \n \nThe radionuclide is not part of the kit. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \nEach vial of Scintimun contains 2 mg of sorbitol. \nOne mL of the radiolabelled solution contains less than 4 mg of sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nKit for radiopharmaceutical preparation. \n \nScintimun: white powder  \nSolvent for Scintimun: white powder  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \nAfter radiolabelling with sodium pertechnetate (\n\n99m\nTc) solution, the technetium (\n\n99m\nTc) besilesomab \n\nsolution obtained is indicated in adults for scintigraphic imaging, in conjunction with other appropriate \nimaging modalities, for determining the location of inflammation/infection in peripheral bone in adults \nwith suspected osteomyelitis. \n \nScintimun should not be used for the diagnosis of diabetic foot infection.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis medicinal product is for use in designated nuclear medicine facilities only, and should only be \nhandled by authorised personnel. \n \nPosology \nAdults \nThe recommended activity of technetium (99mTc) besilesomab should be between 400 MBq and \n800 MBq.  \nThis corresponds to the administration of 0.25 to 1 mg of besilesomab.  \n \nFor repeated use, see section 4.4. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nRenal impairment / Hepatic impairment \nFormal studies have not been performed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. However, due to \nthe nature of the molecule and the short half-life of technetium (99mTc) besilesomab, dose adjustment \nis not necessary in such patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Scintimun in children and adolescents have not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nThe radiolabelled solution should be administered intravenously as a single dose only. \n \nThis medicinal product should be reconstituted and radiolabelled before administration to the patient. \nFor instructions on reconstitution and radiolabelling of the medicinal product before administration, \nsee section 12. \n \nFor patient preparation, see section 4.4.  \n \nImage acquisition \nImages acquisition should start 3 to 6 hours after administration. An additional acquisition 24 hours \nafter initial injection is recommended. Acquisition can be performed using planar imaging.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other murine antibodies, to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1 or to any of the components of the labelled radiopharmaceutical. \n \nPositive screening test for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA).  \n \nPregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPotential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions \nIf hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be \ndiscontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate \naction in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products and equipment such as endotracheal tube and \nventilator must be immediately available.  \nSince allergic reactions to the murine protein cannot be excluded, cardiovascular treatment, \ncorticosteroids, and antihistamines must be available during administration of the product. \n \nIndividual benefit/risk justification \nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. \nThe activity administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the \nrequired diagnostic information. \n \nPatient preparation \nScintimun should be given to sufficiently hydrated patients. In order to obtain images of best quality \nand to reduce the radiation exposure of the bladder, patients should be encouraged to drink sufficient \namounts and to empty their bladder prior to and after the scintigraphic examination. \n \nAn interval of at least 2 days must be observed between any previous scintigraphy with other \ntechnetium (99mTc)-labelled agents and administration of Scintimun.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nInterpretation of images \nThere are currently no criteria to distinguish infection and inflammation by means of Scintimun \nimaging. Scintimun images should be interpreted in the context of other appropriate anatomical and/or \nfunctional imaging examinations.  \n \nOnly limited data is available about binding of technetium (99mTc) besilesomab to CarcinoEmbryonic \nAntigen (CEA) expressing tumours in vivo. In vitro, besilesomab cross-reacts with CEA. False \npositive findings in patients with CEA expressing tumours cannot be excluded. \n \nFalse results may be obtained in patients with diseases involving neutrophil defects and to patients \nwith haematological malignancies including myeloma. \n \nAfter the procedure \nClose contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the first 12 hours after the \ninjection. \n \nSpecific warnings \n \nFructose intolerance \nScintimun contains sorbitol therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nshould not be administered this product. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \nHuman Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA) \nAdministration of murine monoclonal antibodies can lead to the development of Human Anti-Mouse \nAntibodies (HAMA). Patients who are HAMA positive may have a greater risk for hypersensitivity \nreactions. Inquiry on possible previous exposure to murine monoclonal antibodies and a HAMA test \nshould be made prior to administration of Scintimun; a positive response would contraindicate the \nadministration of Scintimun (see section 4.3). \n \nRepeated use \nData on repeated dosing of Scintimun are very limited. Scintimun should only be used once in a \npatient’s lifetime.  \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nActive substances which inhibit inflammation or affect the haematopoietic system (such as antibiotics \nand corticosteroids) may lead to false negative results.  \n \nSuch substances should therefore not be administered together with, or a short time before the \ninjection of Scintimun. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is \nimportant to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be \nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. . If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the \nwoman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using \nionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. \n \nPregnancy  \nThe use of besilesomab is contraindicated in pregnant women (see section 4.3).  \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \n \nBreast-feeding  \nIt is not known if the product is excreted in human milk. A risk to a breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nBefore administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be \ngiven to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased \nbreast-feeding and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the \nsecretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should \nbe interrupted for three days and the expressed feeds discarded. These three days correspond to \n10 half-lives of technetium (99mTc) (60 hours). At that time the remaining activity represents about \n1/1000 of the initial activity in the body.  \n \nClose contact with infants should be restricted during the first 12 hours after the injection. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nScintimun has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn the most recent clinical study in which 123 patients were administered Scintimun, the most \ncommonly reported adverse reaction was the development of anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) in 14 % \nof the patients, after a single administration (16 positive over 116 assayed one and/or three months \nafter the administration). \n \nThe table below reports adverse reactions by MedDRA system organ classes. The frequencies are \nbased on the most recent clinical trial and non interventional safety survey. \n \nThe frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: \nVery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA System Organ \nClasses \n\nAdverse reactions Frequency  \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction Rare \n Hypersensitivity, including angioedema, \n\nurticaria \nUncommon \n\nVascular disorders Hypotension Common \nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMyalgia, arthralgia Rare \n\nInvestigations Human anti-mouse antibody positive Very common \n \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. For diagnostic nuclear medicine investigations the frequency of these adverse \nreactions is not known. As the effective dose is about 6.9 mSv when the maximal  recommended \nactivity of 800 MBq is administered these adverse reactions are expected to occur with a low \nprobability.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \nIn the event of administration of a radiation overdose with technetium (99mTc) besilesomab, the \nabsorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the \nradionuclide from the body by forced diuresis and frequent bladder voiding, and by the use of \nlaxatives to promote faecal excretion. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, inflammation and infection detection, \nTechnetium (99mTc) compounds. ATC code: V09HA03 \n \nMechanism of action \nBesilesomab is a murine immunoglobulin of IgG1 isotype that specifically binds to NCA-95 (non \nspecific cross-reacting antigen 95), an epitope expressed at the cell membrane of granulocytes and \ngranulocyte precursors. Besilesomab cross-reacts with tumours expressing carcinoembryonic antigen \n(CEA). Besilesomab has no effect on activation of complement, granulocyte function or platelets.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nAt the recommended activities, it does not exert any clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects. \n \nClinical efficacy \nIn a randomised cross-over trial comparing blinded reading of Scintimun and 99mTc-White Blood Cells \n(WBCs) images in 119 patients with suspected osteomyelitis, the agreement rate between the two \nmethods was 83 % (lower 95 % confidence interval limit: 80 %). However, based on the investigator’s \ndiagnosis after one month of follow-up, Scintimun had a slightly lower specificity (71.8 %) than \n99mTc-WBCs (79.5 %). \n \nThere are insufficient data on the use of Scintimun for the diagnosis of diabetic foot infection. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nWhole blood concentration-time radioactivity curves show a two-phase course, which can be \nsubdivided into an early phase (0-2 h) and a late phase (5-24 h). After correcting for the decay of \nradionuclide, the calculated half-life of the early phase is 0.5 h whereas the late phase shows a half-life \nof elimination of 16 h. \n \nOrgan uptake \nSix hours after injection, about 1.5 % of the whole body radioactivity is found in the liver whereas \nabout 3.0 % is found in the spleen. Twenty-four hours after injection, the percentages of radioactivity \nare 1.6 % in the liver and 2.3 % in the spleen. \n \nNon pathological unusual accumulations may be observed in the spleen (up to 6 % of the patients), in \nthe bowel (up to 4 % of the patients), in the liver and bone marrow (up to 3 % of the patients), and in \nthe thyroid and kidneys (up to 2 % of patients). \n \n\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=V09HA\n\n\n7 \n \n\nElimination \nMeasurement of radioactivity levels in urine shows that up to 14 % of the administered activity is \nexcreted via the bladder during the 24 h post-injection. The low renal clearance of activity (0.2 L/h for \na glomerular filtration rate around 7 L/h) indicates that the kidney is not the major route of \nbesilesomab elimination. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical toxicity and safety studies were performed using commercial kits reconstituted with \ndecayed technetium (99mTc) and thus the effect of radiation has not been assessed. \n \nPreclinical data obtained with the non-radioactive compound reveal no special hazard for humans \nbased on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity, \nalthough antimurine antibodies were found in all dose groups (including controls) in a repeated-dose \nstudy in monkeys. Genotoxicity studies conducted to test for potentially genotoxic impurities were \nalso negative. Long-term carcinogenicity studies and toxicity to reproduction have not been carried \nout. \n \n \n6.

DOSIMETRY \n \nTechnetium (99mTc) is produced by means of a (99Mo/99mTc) generator and decays with the emission of \ngamma radiation with a mean energy of  140 keV and a half-life of 6.02 hours to technetium (99Tc) \nwhich, in view of its long half-life of 2.13 x 105 years can be regarded as quasi stable. \n \nFor each organ, or group of organs, the absorbed doses have been calculated using the methodology \ndeveloped by the MIRD (Medical Internal Radiation Dose).  \n \nThe effective dose has been calculated by using the absorbed doses determined for each individual \norgan, taking into account the weighting factors (radiation and tissue) to use according to the \nrecommendations of the ICRP (International Commission of Radiological Protection, \nPublication 103). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nTable 1: Values of the absorbed doses calculated for the individual male and female of reference. \n \n\nOrgan mSv/MBq \n Reference male Reference female \nBrain 0.00236 0.00312 \nHeart 0.00495 0.00597 \nColon 0.00450 0.00576 \nStomach 0.00445 0.00535 \nLiver 0.0100 0.0126 \nSmall Intestine 0.00480 0.00575 \nBone marrow (red) 0.0242 0.0229 \nMuscles 0.00317 0.00391 \nOvaries  0.00594 \nPancreas 0.00690 0.00826 \nSkin 0.00178 0.00216 \nLungs 0.0125 0.0160 \nSpleen 0.0271 0.0324 \nKidney 0.0210 0.0234 \nBreast  0.00301 \nAdrenal 0.00759 0.00937 \nTestis 0.00182  \nThymus 0.00351 0.00423 \nThyroid 0.00279 0.00321 \nBone 0.0177 0.0227 \nUterus  0.00501 \nGallbladder 0.00591 0.00681 \nBladder 0.00305 0.00380 \nWhole body 0.00445 0.00552 \nEffective Dose   0.00863 mSv / MBq \n\n \nThe effective dose resulting from the administration of an activity of 800 MBq for an adult weighing \n70 kg is 6.9 mSv. \nFor an administered activity of 800 MBq the typical radiation dose to the target organ bone is \n14.2 mGy and the typical radiation doses to the critical organs, bone marrow, spleen and kidneys are \n19.4 mGy, 21.7 mGy, and 16.8 mGy respectively. \n \n \n12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nScintimun is a sterile powder containing 1 mg of besilesomab per vial Scintimun. \n \nWithdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened. \nAfter disinfecting the stopper, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose \nsyringe fitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised \nautomated application system.  \nIf the integrity of this vial is compromised, the product should not be used \n \nMethod of preparation \nTo ensure the highest radiolabelling efficiency: \n- Radiolabelling is performed using freshly eluted sodium pertechnetate (99mTc).  \n- Eluates should only be taken from a technetium (99mTc)-generator that has been eluted within \n\nthe past 24 hours (i.e. with less than 24 h in-grow).  \n- The first eluate taken from a technetium (99mTc)-generator that has not been eluted over the \n\nweekend must NOT be used. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nProcedure \n1. Take a vial of Solvent for Scintimun (yellow crimped aluminium capsule) from the kit. \n\nDisinfect the septum and allow drying. Using a syringe, introduce through the rubber seal 5 mL \nof 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Without removing the needle, withdraw an equivalent \nvolume of air in order to avoid excess pressure in the vial. Shake smoothly.  \n\n2. After complete dissolution, disinfect the septum and allow drying. Transfer 1 mL of this \nsolution with a hypodermic syringe into a vial of Scintimun (green crimped aluminium \ncapsule). Without removing the needle, withdraw an equivalent volume of air in order to avoid \nexcess pressure in the vial. Swirl carefully; the content of the vial of Scintimun will dissolve \nwithin one minute (DO NOT shake). \n\n3. After 1 min, check that the content of the vial of Scintimun has completely dissolved. Place the \nvial of Scintimun in an appropriate lead shielding container. Disinfect the septum and allow \ndrying. Using a hypodermic syringe, introduce through the rubber seal 2-7 mL of \npertechnetate (99mTc) (the eluate complies with the requirements of current Eur. Ph.). Without \nremoving the needle, withdraw an equivalent volume of air in order to avoid excess pressure in \nthe vial. Swirl carefully to mix the whole solution (DO NOT shake). The activity must be \nbetween 400 and 1800 MBq depending on the volume of pertechnetate (99mTc). The total \nvolume in the vial of Scintimun equals 3 to 8 mL. \n\n4. Fill in the enclosed label and fix it to the radiolabelled solution. \n5. 10 min after the addition of pertechnetate (99mTc) the solution is ready for injection.  \n \nNotes on the instructions \n- Solvent for Scintimun must NEVER be radiolabelled first and then added to Scintimun. \n- The final radiolabelled injection solution must be protected from oxygen. \n \nAfter reconstitution with the solvent provided and the radiolabelling with sodium pertechnetate (99mTc) \ninjection, the resulting clear and colourless solution for injection of technetium (99mTc)-besilesomab \nhas a pH of 6.5-7.5.  \n \nQuality control \nThe radiochemical purity of the final radiolabelled preparation can be tested according to the \nfollowing procedure: \n \nMethod \nInstant thin layer chromatography or paper chromatography. \n \nMaterials and reagents \n- Adsorbent: strips (2.5 x 20 cm) for thin layer chromatography coated with silica gel (ITLC-SG) \n\nor for paper chromatography (RBM-1). Trace a starting line 2.5 cm from the bottom of the \npaper strip. \n\n- Solvent: methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) \n- Containers: appropriate containers such as chromatography tank or 1 000 mL Erlenmeyer \n\nflasks. \n- Miscellaneous: forceps, scissors, syringes, appropriate counting assembly. \n \nProcedure \nDo not let air enter the vial to be tested and store all vials containing radioactive solution in lead \nshielding. \n1. Introduce the solvent into the chromatography tank to a depth of approximately 2 cm. Cover the \n\ntank and allow to equilibrate for at least 5 minutes. \n2. Apply a spot (2 µL) of the radiolabelled solution to the starting line of the ITLC-SG or RBM-1 \n\npaper strip using a syringe and a needle.  \n3. Introduce the ITLC-SG or RBM-1 paper strip immediately into the chromatography tank using \n\nforceps to avoid formation of pertechnetate (99mTc) due to oxygen. DO NOT let the spot dry. \n4. When the solvent has reached the top of the strip (about 10 minutes), use the forceps to remove \n\nthe strip and dry in the air.  \n5. Cut the strip in two separate parts at Rf = 0.5. \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n6. Separately count each cut part of the strip and record the obtained values (use an appropriate \ndetection apparatus with a constant counting time, and known geometry and background noise). \n\n7. Calculations \n The radiochemical purity corresponds to the percentage of bound technetium (99mTc) and is \n\ncalculated as follows after correcting data for background noise: \n \n\n% bound technetium (99mTc) = 100 % - % free Technetium (99mTc) \n \n\nWhere, % free technetium (99mTc) =   x 100 \n \n \n\n8. The radiochemical purity (the percentage of bound Technetium (99mTc)) must be more than or \nequal to 95 %. \n\n9. The solution should be inspected visually prior to use. Only clear solutions, free of visible \nparticles should be used. \n\n \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency  http://www.ema.europa.eu \n \n  \n\nstrip ofactivity  Total\n1.0 Rf  to0.5 Rf from stripcut  ofActivity  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n \nA.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or the nuclear medicine specialist who will \n\nsupervise the procedure. \n-  If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor or pharmacist. This includes \n\nany possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Scintimun is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Scintimun  \n3. How Scintimun is given  \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How Scintimun is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Scintimun is and what it is used for \n \nScintimun is a medicine containing an antibody (besilesomab) used to target specific cells called \ngranulocytes (a type of white blood cells involved in the inflammation process) in your body. \nScintimun is used for the preparation of a radioactive solution for injection of technetium(99mTc)-\nbesilesomab. Technetium(99mTc) is a radioactive element allowing the organs where besilesomab \naccumulates to be seen using a special camera. \n \nThis medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only in adults. \nAfter injection into your vein, your doctor can obtain pictures (scans) of your organs that give more \ninformation about the detection of sites of inflammation and/or infection. However Scintimun should \nnot be used for the diagnosis of diabetic foot infection. \nThe use of Scintimun does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the \nnuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the \nprocedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweights the risk due to radiation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Scintimun  \n \nScintimun must not be used: \n- if you are allergic to besilesomab, to antibody from mouse origin or any other antibodies, or to \n\nsodium pertechnetate (99mTc) solution or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in \nsection 6. \n\n- if you have a positive response to a test detecting human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA test). \nAsk your doctor if you are not sure. \n\n- if you are pregnant. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to the nuclear medicine specialist before using Scintimun: \n- if you have previously been administered Scintimun, because you should only be administered \n\nScintimun once in your lifetime. If you are not sure if you have been given this medicine before, \nplease let your doctor know. \n\n- if you have had a scintigraphy with technetium in the last 2 days. \n- if you have a tumoral pathology involving a secretion of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) \n\nwhich could interfere with this investigation. \n- if you have any blood disease. \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \nBefore administration of Scintimun \nIn order to obtain images of best quality and to reduce the radiation exposure of your bladder, you \nshould drink sufficient amounts and empty your bladder prior to and after the scintigraphic \nexamination. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of age because the safety and \nefficacy of the product have not been established. \n \nOther medicines and Scintimun \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking,  have recently taken  or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, since they may interfere with the \ninterpretation of the images. \nMedicines reducing inflammation and medicines affecting the production of your blood cells (such as \ncorticosteroids or antibiotics) may affect the results of your examination. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.  \n \nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of Scintimun if there is a \npossibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. When \nin doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure. \n \nIf you are pregnant you must not be given Scintimun. \nInvestigations in nuclear medicine may involve a risk to the unborn. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding you must stop breast-feeding for 3 days after your injection and the expressed \nmilk should be discarded. If you wish, you can express and store your breast milk before your \ninjection. This will protect your child from the radiation that may be present in your breast milk. \nPlease ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. \nMoreover you must avoid close contact with your child during the first 12 hours after the injection. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is considered unlikely that Scintimun will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nScintimun contains sorbitol and sodium \nIf you have an intolerance to some sugars (for example fructose or sorbitol), tell your doctor before \nyou are given Scintimun. \n \nScintimun contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’. \n \n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n3. How Scintimun is given  \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Scintimun \nwill only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by \npeople who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe \nuse of this product and will keep you informed of their actions. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure  will decide on the quantity of \ntechnetium(99mTc)- besilesomab to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to \nget the desired information.  \nThe quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 400 to 800 MBq \n(megabecquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity).  \n \nAdministration of Scintimun and conduct of the procedure \nScintimun is administered intravenously. \nA single injection into a vein in your arm is sufficient to conduct the test your doctor needs. \n \nDuration of the procedure \nYour Nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure.  \n \nAfter administration of Scintimun \nBecause you could emit radiation especially harmful to young children during the first 12 hours after \nthe injection, you should avoid close contact with young children and pregnant women during this \nperiod of time. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after \nreceiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. \n \nIf you have been given more Scintimun than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely because injection is prepared as a single dose by the hospital personnel, under \nstrictly controlled conditions. However, in the case of an overdose, you will be asked to drink plenty \nof water and to take laxatives to increase the elimination of the product from your body. \n \nShould you have any further questions on the use of Scintimun, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor \nwho supervises the procedure. \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThis radiopharmaceutical will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation associated with the least risk \nof cancer and hereditary abnormalities. \n \nAbout 14 out of 100 patients having this injection have been found to produce antibodies in their \nblood reacting against the antibody present in Scintimun. This may increase the risk of allergic \nreactions in case of repeated administration of Scintimun.
