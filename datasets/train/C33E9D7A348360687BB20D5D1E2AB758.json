CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nInovelon is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with \nLennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 1 year of age and older.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with rufinamide should be initiated by a physician specialised in paediatrics or neurology \nwith experience in the treatment of epilepsy.\n\nInovelon oral suspension and Inovelon film-coated tablets may be interchanged at equal doses. \nPatients should be monitored during the switch over period.\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\n\nUse in children from 1 year to less than 4 years of age\n\nPatients not receiving valproate:\nTreatment should be initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses\nseparated by approximately 12 hours. According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be \nincreased by up to 10 mg/kg/day every third day to a target dose of 45 mg/kg/day administered in two \nequally divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. For this patient population, the maximum \nrecommended dose is 45 mg/kg/day.\n\nPatients receiving valproate:\nAs valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is \nrecommended for patients being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a dose \nof 10 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. \nAccording to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased by up to 10 mg/kg/day \nevery third day to a target dose of 30 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses separated \nby approximately 12 hours. For this patient population, the maximum recommended dose \nis 30 mg/kg/day.\n\nIf the recommended calculated dose of Inovelon is not achievable, the dose should be given to the \nnearest whole 100 mg tablet.\n\nUse in children 4 years of age or older and less than 30 kg\n\nPatients < 30 kg not receiving valproate:\nTreatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 200 mg. According to clinical response and \ntolerability, the dose may be increased by 200 mg/day increments, as frequently as every third day, up \nto a maximum recommended dose of 1,000 mg/day.\n\nDoses of up to 3,600 mg/day have been studied in a limited number of patients.\n\nPatients < 30 kg also receiving valproate:\nAs valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is \nrecommended for patients < 30 kg being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a \ndaily dose of 200 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, after a minimum of 2 days the \ndose may be increased by 200 mg/day, to the maximum recommended dose of 600 mg/day.\n\nUse in adults, adolescents and children 4 years of age or older of 30 kg or over\n\nPatients > 30 kg not receiving valproate:\nTreatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg. According to clinical response and \ntolerability, the dose may be increased by 400 mg/day increments, as frequently as every other day, up \nto a maximum recommended dose as indicated in the table below.\n\nWeight range 30.0 \u2013 50.0 kg 50.1 \u2013 70.0 kg \u226570.1 kg\nMaximum \nrecommended dose \n\n1,800 mg/day 2,400 mg/day 3,200 mg/day\n\nDoses of up to 4,000 mg/day (in the 30 - -50 kg range) or 4,800 mg/day (in the over 50 kg) have been \nstudied in a limited number of patients.\n\n\n\n4\n\nPatients > 30 kg also receiving valproate:\nTreatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg. According to clinical response and \ntolerability, the dose may be increased by 400 mg/day increments, as frequently as every other day, up \nto a maximum recommended dose as indicated in the table below.\n\nWeight range 30.0 \u2013 50.0 kg 50.1 \u2013 70.0 kg \u226570.1 kg\nMaximum \nrecommended dose\n\n1,200 mg/day 1,600 mg/day 2,200 mg/day\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information on the use of rufinamide in older people. Since the pharmacokinetics of \nrufinamide are not altered in older people (see section 5.2), dosage adjustment is not required in \npatients over 65 years of age.\n\nRenal impairment\nA study in patients with severe renal impairment indicated that no dose adjustments are required for \nthese patients (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nUse in patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied. Caution and careful dose titration is \nrecommended when treating patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Use in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment is not recommended.\n\nDiscontinuation of rufinamide\nWhen rufinamide treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually. In clinical trials \nrufinamide discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two days \n(see section 4.4).\n\nIn the case of one or more missed doses, individualised clinical judgement is necessary.\n\nUncontrolled open-label studies suggest sustained long-term efficacy, although no controlled study has \nbeen conducted for longer than three months.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of rufinamide in new-born infants or infants and toddlers aged less than 1 year \nhave not been established. No data are available (see section 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nRufinamide is for oral use.\n\nThe tablet should be taken twice daily with water in the morning and in the evening, in two equally \ndivided doses.\n\nInovelon should be administered with food (see section 5.2). If the patient has difficulty with \nswallowing, tablets can be crushed and administered in half a glass of water. Alternatively, use the \nscore line to break the tablet into two equal halves.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, triazole derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\n\n\n5\n\nStatus epilepticus\n\nStatus epilepticus cases have been observed during treatment with rufinamide in clinical development \nstudies, whereas no such cases were observed with placebo. These events led to rufinamide \ndiscontinuation in 20% of the cases. If patients develop new seizure types and/or experience an \nincreased frequency of status epilepticus that is different from the patient\u2019s baseline condition, then the \nbenefit-risk ratio of the therapy should be reassessed.\n\nWithdrawal of rufinamide\n\nRufinamide should be withdrawn gradually to reduce the possibility of seizures on withdrawal. In \nclinical studies discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two \ndays. There are insufficient data on the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products \nonce seizure control has been achieved with the addition of rufinamide.\n\nCentral Nervous System reactions\n\nRufinamide treatment has been associated with dizziness, somnolence, ataxia and gait disturbances, \nwhich could increase the occurrence of accidental falls in this population (see section 4.8). Patients \nand carers should exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of this medicinal \nproduct.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nSerious antiepileptic medicinal product hypersensitivity syndrome including DRESS (Drug Reaction \nwith Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have occurred in \nassociation with rufinamide therapy. Signs and symptoms of this disorder were diverse; however, \npatients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash associated with other organ \nsystem involvement. Other associated manifestations included lymphadenopathy, liver function tests \nabnormalities, and haematuria. As the disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system signs \nand symptoms not noted here may occur. The antiepileptic drug (AED) hypersensitivity syndrome \noccurred in close temporal association to the initiation of rufinamide therapy and in the paediatric \npopulation. If this reaction is suspected, rufinamide should be discontinued and alternative treatment \nstarted. All patients who develop a rash while taking rufinamide must be closely monitored.\n\nQT shortening\n\nIn a thorough QT study, rufinamide produced a decrease in QTc interval proportional to concentration. \nAlthough the underlying mechanism and safety relevance of this finding is not known, clinicians \nshould use clinical judgment when assessing whether to prescribe rufinamide to patients at risk from \nfurther shortening their QTc duration (e.g., Congenital Short QT Syndrome or patients with a family \nhistory of such a syndrome).\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment with Inovelon. \nPhysicians should try to ensure that appropriate contraception is used, and should use clinical \njudgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives, or the doses of the oral contraceptive \ncomponents, are adequate, based on the individual patients clinical situation (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).\n\nLactose\n\nInovelon contains lactose, therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n\n\n6\n\nSuicidal ideation\n\nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic \nmedicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The \nmechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an \nincreased risk for Inovelon.\n\nTherefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect rufinamide\n\nOther antiepileptic medicinal products\nRufinamide concentrations are not subject to clinically relevant changes on co-administration with \nknown enzyme inducing antiepileptic medicinal products.\n\nFor patients on Inovelon treatment who have administration of valproate initiated, significant increases \nin rufinamide plasma concentrations may occur. Therefore, consideration should be given to a dose \nreduction of Inovelon in patients who are initiated on valproate therapy (see section 4.2).\n\nThe addition or withdrawal of these medicinal products or adjusting of the dose of these medicinal \nproducts during rufinamide therapy may require an adjustment in dosage of rufinamide (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nNo significant changes in rufinamide concentration are observed following co-administration with \nlamotrigine, topiramate or benzodiazepines.\n\nPotential for rufinamide to affect other medicinal products\n\nOther antiepileptic medicinal products\nThe pharmacokinetic interactions between rufinamide and other antiepileptic medicinal products have \nbeen evaluated in patients with epilepsy, using population pharmacokinetic modelling. Rufinamide \nappears not to have a clinically relevant effect on carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, \ntopiramate, phenytoin or valproate steady state concentrations.\n\nOral contraceptives\nCo-administration of rufinamide 800 mg twice daily and a combined oral contraceptive\n(ethinyloestradiol 35 \u03bcg and norethindrone 1 mg) for 14 days resulted in a mean decrease in the \nethinyl estradiol AUC0-24 of 22% and in norethindrone AUC0-24 of 14%. Studies with other oral or \nimplant contraceptives have not been conducted. Women of child-bearing potential using hormonal \ncontraceptives are advised to use an additional safe and effective contraceptive method (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.6).\n\n\n\n7\n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes\nRufinamide is metabolised by hydrolysis, and is not metabolised to any notable degree by cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. Furthermore, rufinamide does not inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes \n(see section 5.2). Thus, clinically significant interactions mediated through inhibition of cytochrome \nP450 system by rufinamide are unlikely to occur. Rufinamide has been shown to induce the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 and may therefore reduce the plasma concentrations of substances \nwhich are metabolised by this enzyme. The effect was modest to moderate. The mean \nCYP3A4 activity, assessed as clearance of triazolam, was increased by 55% after 11 days of treatment \nwith rufinamide 400 mg twice daily. The exposure of triazolam was reduced by 36%. Higher \nrufinamide doses may result in a more pronounced induction. It may not be excluded that rufinamide \nmay also decrease the exposure of substances metabolised by other enzymes, or transported by \ntransport proteins such as P-glycoprotein.\n\nIt is recommended that patients treated with substances that are metabolised by the CYP3A4 enzyme \nsystem are to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the start of, or after the end of treatment with \nrufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A dose adjustment of the concomitantly \nadministered medicinal product may need to be considered. These recommendations should also be \nconsidered when rufinamide is used concomitantly with substances with a narrow therapeutic window \nsuch as warfarin and digoxin.\n\nA specific interaction study in healthy subjects revealed no influence of rufinamide at a dose \nof 400 mg twice daily on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine, a CYP1A2 substrate.\n\nNo data on the interaction of rufinamide with alcohol are available.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general:\nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. In the treated \npopulation, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy; however, the extent to \nwhich the treatment and/or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.\n\nMoreover, effective antiepileptic therapy should not be interrupted abruptly, since the aggravation of \nthe illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. AED treatment during pregnancy should be \ncarefully discussed with the treating physician.\n\nRisk related to rufinamide:\nStudies in animals revealed no teratogenic effect, but foetotoxicity in the presence of maternal toxicity \nwas observed (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.\n\nFor rufinamide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.\n\nTaking these data into consideration, rufinamide should not be used during pregnancy, or in women of \nchildbearing age not using contraceptive measures, unless clearly necessary.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment with rufinamide. \nPhysicians should try to ensure that appropriate contraception is used, and should use clinical \njudgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives, or the doses of the oral contraceptive \ncomponents, are adequate based on the individual patients clinical situation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nIf women treated with rufinamide plan to become pregnant, the continued use of this product should \nbe carefully weighed. During pregnancy, interruption of an effective antiepileptic can be detrimental \nto both the mother and the foetus if it results in aggravation of the illness.\n\n\n\n8\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known if rufinamide is excreted in human breast milk. Due to the potential harmful effects for \nthe breast-fed infant, breast-feeding should be avoided during maternal treatment with rufinamide.\n\nFertility\n\nNo data are available on the effects on fertility following treatment with rufinamide.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nInovelon may cause dizziness, somnolence and blurred vision. Depending on the individual \nsensitivity, rufinamide may have a minor to major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients must be advised to exercise caution during activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g., \ndriving or operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe clinical development program has included over 1,900 patients, with different types of epilepsy, \nexposed to rufinamide. The most commonly reported adverse reactions overall were headache, \ndizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions observed at a higher \nincidence than placebo in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were somnolence and vomiting. \nAdverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The discontinuation rate in \nLennox-Gastaut syndrome due to adverse reactions was 8.2% for patients receiving rufinamide \nand 0% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in \ndiscontinuation from the rufinamide treatment group were rash and vomiting.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than placebo, during the Lennox-Gastaut \nsyndrome double-blind studies or in the overall rufinamide-exposed population, are listed in the table \nbelow by MedDRA preferred term, system organ class and by frequency.\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).\n\n\n\n9\n\nSystem Organ\nClass Very Common Common Uncommon Rare\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nPneumonia\nInfluenza\nNasopharyngitis\nEar infection\nSinusitis\nRhinitis\n\nImmune system \ndisorders Hypersensitivity*\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nAnorexia\nEating disorder\nDecreased appetite\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nAnxiety\nInsomnia\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nSomnolence* Status epilepticus*\nConvulsion\nCoordination \nAbnormal*\nNystagmus\n\nHeadache\nDizziness*\n\nPsychomotor \nhyperactivity\nTremor\n\nEye Disorders Diplopia\nVision blurred\n\nEar and \nLabyrinth \ndisorders\n\nVertigo\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nEpistaxis\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nNausea Abdominal pain \nupper\n\nVomiting Constipation\nDyspepsia\nDiarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nHepatic enzyme \nincrease\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash*\n\nAcne\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue and bone \ndisorders\n\nBack pain\n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders\n\nOligomenorrhoea\n\n\n\n10\n\nSystem Organ\nClass Very Common Common Uncommon Rare\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nFatigue Gait disturbance*\n\nInvestigations Weight decrease\n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\nHead injury\nContusion\n\n*Cross reference to section 4.4.\n\nAdditional information on special populations\n\nPaediatric Population (age 1 to less than 4 years)\nIn a multicentre, open-label study comparing the addition of rufinamide to any other AED of the \ninvestigator\u2019s choice to the existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs in paediatric patients, 1 to less \nthan 4 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS, 25 patients, of which 10 subjects were \naged 1 to 2 years, were exposed to rufinamide as adjunctive therapy for 24 weeks at a dose of up \nto 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 divided doses. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment \ngroup (occurring in \u2265 10% of subjects) were upper respiratory tract infection and vomiting (28.0% \neach), pneumonia and somnolence (20.0% each), sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough and pyrexia \n(16.0% each), and bronchitis, constipation, nasal congestion, rash, irritability and decreased appetite \n(12.0% each). The frequency, type and severity of these adverse reactions were similar to that in \nchildren 4 years of age and older, adolescents and adults. Age characterisation in patients less \nthan 4 years was not identified in the limited safety database due to small number of patients in the \nstudy.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAfter an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. \nThere is no specific antidote for rufinamide. Treatment should be supportive and may include \nhaemodialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nMultiple dosing of 7,200 mg/day was associated with no major signs or symptoms.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives; ATC code: N03AF03.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRufinamide modulates the activity of sodium channels, prolonging their inactive state. Rufinamide is \nactive in a range of animal models of epilepsy.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nClinical experience\n\nInovelon (rufinamide tablets) was administered in a double blind, placebo-controlled study, at doses of \nup to 45 mg/kg/day for 84 days, to 139 patients with inadequately controlled seizures associated with \nLennox-Gastaut Syndrome (including both atypical absence seizures and drop attacks). Male and \nfemale patients (between 4 and 30 years of age) were eligible if they had a history of multiple seizure \ntypes, which had to include atypical absence seizures and drop attacks (i.e., tonic\u2013atonic or astatic \nseizures); were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant fixed dose antiepileptic medicinal products; a \nminimum of 90 seizures in the month before the 28-day baseline period; an EEG within 6 months of \nstudy entry demonstrating a pattern of slow spike-and-wave complexes (2.5 Hz); a weight of at \nleast 18 kg; and a CT scan or MRI study confirming the absence of a progressive lesion. All seizures \nwere classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy Revised Classification of \nSeizures. As it is difficult for caregivers to precisely separate tonic and atonic seizures, the \ninternational expert panel of child neurologists agreed to group these seizure types and call them \ntonic\u2013atonic seizures or \u201cdrop attacks\u201d. As such, drop attacks were used as one of the primary end \npoints. A significant improvement was observed for all three primary variables: the percentage change \nin total seizure frequency per 28 days during the maintenance phase relative to baseline (-35.8% on \nInovelon vs. \u20131.6% on placebo, p=0.0006), the number of tonic-atonic seizures (-42.9% on Inovelon \nvs. 2.2% on placebo, p=0.0002), and the seizure severity rating from the Global Evaluation performed \nby the parent/guardian at the end of the double-blind phase (much or very much improved in 32.2% on \nInovelon vs. 14.5% on the placebo arm, p=0.0041).\n\nAdditionally, Inovelon (rufinamide oral suspension) was administered in a multicentre, open-label \nstudy comparing the addition of rufinamide to the addition of any other AED of the investigator\u2019s \nchoice to the existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs in paediatric patients, 1 to less than 4 years of age with \ninadequately controlled LGS. In this study, 25 patients were exposed to rufinamide as adjunctive \ntherapy for 24 weeks at a dose of up to 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 divided doses. A total of 12 patients \nreceived any other AED at the investigator\u2019s discretion in the control arm. The study was mainly \ndesigned for safety and not adequately powered to show a difference with regards to the seizure \nefficacy variables. The adverse event profile was similar to that in children 4 years of age and older, \nadolescents, and adults. In addition, the study investigated the cognitive development, behaviour and \nlanguage development of subjects treated with rufinamide compared to subjects receiving \nany-other-AED. The Least Square mean change of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) Total \nProblems score after 2 years of treatment were 53.75 for the any other AED group and 56.35 for the \nrufinamide group (LS mean difference [95% CI] +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; p=0.6928), and the difference \nbetween treatments was -2.776 (95% CI: -13.3, 7.8, p=0.5939).\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling demonstrated that the reduction of total and \ntonic-atonic seizure frequencies, the improvement of the global evaluation of seizure severity and the \nincrease in probability of reduction of seizure frequency were dependent on rufinamide \nconcentrations.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nMaximum plasma levels are reached approximately 6 hours after administration. Peak concentration \n(Cmax) and plasma AUC of rufinamide increase less than proportionally with doses in both fasted and \nfed healthy subjects and in patients, probably due to dose-limited absorption behaviour. After single \ndoses, food increases the bioavailability (AUC) of rufinamide by approximately 34% and the peak \nplasma concentration by 56%.\n\nInovelon oral suspension and Inovelon film-coated tablets have been demonstrated to be \nbioequivalent.\n\n\n\n12\n\nDistribution\n\nIn in -vitro studies, only a small fraction of rufinamide (34%) was bound to human serum proteins \nwith albumin accounting for approximately 80% of this binding. This indicates minimal risk of \ndrug-drug interactions by displacement from binding sites during concomitant administration of other \nsubstances. Rufinamide was evenly distributed between erythrocytes and plasma.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nRufinamide is almost exclusively eliminated by metabolism. The main pathway of metabolism is \nhydrolysis of the carboxylamide group to the pharmacologically inactive acid derivative CGP 47292. \nCytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is very minor. The formation of small amounts of glutathione \nconjugates cannot be completely excluded.\n\nRufinamide has demonstrated little or no significant capacity in -vitro to act as a competitive or \nmechanism-based inhibitor of the following human P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 or CYP4A9/11-2.\n\nElimination\n\nThe plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6-10 hours in healthy subjects and patients with \nepilepsy. When given twice daily at 12-hourly intervals, rufinamide accumulates to the extent \npredicted by its terminal half-life, indicating that the pharmacokinetics of rufinamide are \ntime-independent (i.e. no autoinduction of metabolism).\n\nIn a radiotracer study in three healthy volunteers, the parent compound (rufinamide) was the main \nradioactive component in plasma, representing about 80% of the total radioactivity, and the metabolite \nCGP 47292 constituting only about 15%. Renal excretion was the predominant route of elimination \nfor active substance related material, accounting for 84.7% of the dose.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity:\n\nThe bioavailability of rufinamide is dependent on dose. As dose increases, the bioavailability \ndecreases.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups\n\nSex\nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling has been used to evaluate the influence of sex on the \npharmacokinetics of rufinamide. Such evaluations indicate that sex does not affect the \npharmacokinetics of rufinamide to a clinically relevant extent.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of a single 400 mg dose of rufinamide were not altered in subjects with chronic \nand severe renal failure compared to healthy volunteers. However, plasma levels were reduced by \napproximately 30% when haemodialysis was applied after administration of rufinamide, suggesting \nthat this may be a useful procedure in case of overdose (see sections 4.2 and 4.9).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment and therefore Inovelon should not \nbe administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\nA pharmacokinetic study in older healthy volunteers did not show a significant difference in \npharmacokinetic parameters compared with younger adults.\n\n\n\n13\n\nChildren (1-12 years)\nChildren generally have lower clearance of rufinamide than adults, and this difference is related to \nbody size with rufinamide clearance increasing with body weight.\n\nA recent population PK analysis of rufinamide on data pooled from 139 subjects (115 LGS patients \nand 24 healthy subjects), including 83 paediatric LGS patients (10 patients \naged 1 to < 2 years, 14 patients aged 2 to < 4 years, 14 patients aged 4 to < 8 years, 21 patients \naged 8 to < 12 years and 24 patients aged 12 to < 18 years) indicated that when rufinamide is dosed on \na mg/kg/day basis in LGS subjects aged 1 to < 4 years, comparable exposure to that in LGS patients \naged \u2265 4 years, in which efficacy has been demostrated, is achieved.\n\nStudies in new-born infants or infants and toddlers under 1 year of age have not been conducted.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nConventional safety pharmacology studies revealed no special hazards at clinically relevant doses.\n\nToxicities observed in dogs at levels similar to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose \nwere liver changes, including bile thrombi, cholestasis and liver enzyme elevations thought to be \nrelated to increased bile secretion in this species. No evidence of an associated risk was identified in \nthe rat and monkey repeat dose toxicity studies.\n\nIn reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, there were reductions in foetal growth and \nsurvival, and some stillbirths secondary to maternal toxicity. However, no effects on morphology and \nfunction, including learning or memory, were observed in the offspring. Rufinamide was not \nteratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits.\n\nThe toxicity profile of rufinamide in juvenile animals was similar to that in adult animals. Decreased \nbody weight gain was observed in both juvenile and adult rats and dogs. Mild toxicity in the liver was \nobserved in juvenile as well as in adult animals at exposure levels lower than or similar to those \nreached in patients. Reversibility of all findings was demonstrated after stopping treatment.\n\nRufinamide was not genotoxic and had no carcinogenic potential. An adverse effect not observed in \nclinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with \npossible relevance to human use, was myelofibrosis of the bone marrow in the mouse carcinogenicity \nstudy. Benign bone neoplasms (osteomas) and hyperostosis seen in mice were considered a result of \nthe activation of a mouse specific virus by fluoride ions released during the oxidative metabolism of \nrufinamide.\n\nRegarding the immunotoxic potential, small thymus and thymic involution were observed in dogs in \na 13-week study with significant response at the high dose in male. In the 13-week study, female bone \nmarrow and lymphoid changes are reported at the high dose with a weak incidence. In rats, decreased \ncellularity of the bone marrow and thymic atrophy were observed only in the carcinogenicity study.\n\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA):\n\nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that rufinamide is very persistent in the \nenvironment (see section 6.6).\n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach ml of oral suspension contains 40 mg rufinamide.\n\n1 bottle of 460 ml contains 18400 mg rufinamide.\n\nExcipients with known effect:\n\nEach ml of oral suspension contains:\n1.2 mg methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218),\n0.3 mg propyl parahydroxybenzoate (E216),\n250 mg sorbitol (E420)\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral suspension.\n\nWhite, slightly viscous suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nInovelon is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with \nLennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 1 year of age and older.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with rufinamide should be initiated by a physician specialised in paediatrics or neurology \nwith experience in the treatment of epilepsy.\n\nInovelon oral suspension and Inovelon film-coated tablets may be interchanged at equal doses. \nPatients should be monitored during the switch over period.\n\n\n\n17\n\nPosology\n\nUse in children from 1 year to less than 4 years of age\n\nPatients not receiving valproate:\nTreatment should be initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 ml/kg/day) administered in two equally \ndivided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. According to clinical response and tolerability, \nthe dose may be increased by up to 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 ml/kg/day) every third day to a target dose \nof 45 mg/kg/day (1.125 ml/kg/day) administered in two equally divided doses separated by \napproximately 12 hours. For this patient population, the maximum recommended dose \nis 45 mg/kg/day (1.125 ml/kg/day).\n\nPatients receiving valproate:\nAs valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is \nrecommended for patients being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a dose \nof 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 ml/kg/day) administered in two equally divided doses separated by \napproximately 12 hours. According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased by \nup to 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 ml/kg/day) every third day to a target dose of 30 mg/kg/day \n(0.75 ml/kg/day) administered in two equally divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. For \nthis patient population, the maximum recommended dose is 30 mg/kg/day (0.75 ml/kg/day).\n\nIf the recommended calculated dose of Inovelon is not achievable, the dose should be given to the \nnearest 0.5 ml of rufinamide.\n\nUse in children 4 years of age or older and less than 30 kg\n\nPatients < 30 kg not receiving valproate:\nTreatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 200 mg (5 ml dosing suspension given as two 2.5 ml \ndoses, one in the morning and one in the evening). According to clinical response and tolerability, the \ndose may be increased by 200 mg/day increments, as frequently as every third day, up to a maximum \nrecommended dose of 1,000 mg/day (25 ml/day).\n\nDoses of up to 3,600 mg/day (90 ml/day) have been studied in a limited number of patients.\n\nPatients < 30 kg also receiving valproate:\nAs valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is \nrecommended for patients < 30 kg being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a \ndaily dose of 200 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, after a minimum of 2 days the \ndose may be increased by 200 mg/day, to the maximum recommended dose of 600 mg/day \n(15 ml/day).\n\nUse in adults, adolescents and children 4 years of age or older of 30 kg or over\n\nPatients > 30 kg not receiving valproate:\nTreatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg (10 ml dosing suspension given as two 5 ml \ndoses). According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased by 400 mg/day \nincrements, as frequently as every other day, up to a maximum recommended dose as indicated in the \ntable below.\n\nWeight range 30.0 \u2013 50.0 kg 50.1 \u2013 70.0 kg \u226570.1 kg\nMaximum \nrecommended dose \n\n1,800 mg/day or\n45 ml/day\n\n2,400 mg/day or\n60 ml/day\n\n3,200 mg/day or\n80 ml/day\n\nDoses of up to 4,000 mg/day (100 ml/day) in the 30 -50 kg range or 4,800 mg/day (120 ml/day) in the \nover 50 kg category have been studied in a limited number of patients.\n\nPatients > 30 kg also receiving valproate:\n\n\n\n18\n\nTreatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg (10 ml dosing suspension given as two 5 ml \ndoses). According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased by 400 mg/day \nincrements, as frequently as every other day, up to a maximum recommended dose as indicated in the \ntable below.\n\nWeight range 30.0 \u2013 50.0 kg 50.1 \u2013 70.0 kg \u226570.1 kg\nMaximum \nrecommended dose\n\n1,200 mg/day or\n30 ml/day\n\n1,600 mg/day or\n40 ml/day\n\n2,200 mg/day or\n55 ml/day\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information on the use of rufinamide in older people. Since the pharmacokinetics of \nrufinamide are not altered in older people (see section 5.2), dosage adjustment is not required in \npatients over 65 years of age.\n\nRenal impairment\nA study in patients with severe renal impairment indicated that no dose adjustments are required for \nthese patients (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nUse in patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied. Caution and careful dose titration is \nrecommended when treating patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Use in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment is not recommended.\n\nDiscontinuation of rufinamide\nWhen rufinamide treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually. In clinical trials \nrufinamide discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two days\n(see section 4.4).\n\nIn the case of one or more missed doses, individualised clinical judgement is necessary.\n\nUncontrolled open-label studies suggest sustained long-term efficacy, although no controlled study has \nbeen conducted for longer than three months.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of rufinamide in new-born infants or infants and toddlers aged less than 1 year \nhave not been established. No data are available (see section 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nRufinamide is for oral use.\n\nThe suspension should be taken twice daily in the morning and in the evening, in two equally divided \ndoses.\n\nInovelon should be administered with food (see section 5.2).\n\nThe oral suspension should be shaken vigorously before every administration. See section 6.6 for \nfurther details.\n\nThe prescribed dose of Inovelon oral suspension can be administered via an enteral feeding tube. \nFollow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the feeding tube to administer the medicine. To ensure \nadequate dosing, after administration of the oral suspension, the enteral feeding tube must be flushed \nat least once with 1 ml of water.\n\n\n\n19\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, triazole derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nStatus epilepticus\n\nStatus epilepticus cases have been observed during treatment with rufinamide in clinical development \nstudies, whereas no such cases were observed with placebo. These events led to rufinamide \ndiscontinuation in 20% of the cases. If patients develop new seizure types and/or experience an \nincreased frequency of status epilepticus that is different from the patient\u2019s baseline condition, then the \nbenefit-risk ratio of the therapy should be reassessed.\n\nWithdrawal of rufinamide\n\nRufinamide should be withdrawn gradually to reduce the possibility of seizures on withdrawal. In \nclinical studies discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two \ndays. There are insufficient data on the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products \nonce seizure control has been achieved with the addition of rufinamide.\n\nCentral Nervous System reactions\n\nRufinamide treatment has been associated with dizziness, somnolence, ataxia and gait disturbances, \nwhich could increase the occurrence of accidental falls in this population (see section 4.8). Patients \nand carers should exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of this medicinal \nproduct.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nSerious antiepileptic medicinal product hypersensitivity syndrome including DRESS (Drug Reaction \nwith Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have occurred in \nassociation with rufinamide therapy. Signs and symptoms of this disorder were diverse; however, \npatients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash associated with other organ \nsystem involvement. Other associated manifestations included lymphadenopathy, liver function tests \nabnormalities, and haematuria. As the disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system signs \nand symptoms not noted here may occur. The antiepileptic drug (AED) hypersensitivity syndrome \noccurred in close temporal association to the initiation of rufinamide therapy and in the paediatric \npopulation. If this reaction is suspected, rufinamide should be discontinued and alternative treatment \nstarted. All patients who develop a rash while taking rufinamide must be closely monitored.\n\nQT shortening\n\nIn a thorough QT study, rufinamide produced a decrease in QTc interval proportional to concentration. \nAlthough the underlying mechanism and safety relevance of this finding is not known, clinicians \nshould use clinical judgment when assessing whether to prescribe rufinamide to patients at risk from \nfurther shortening their QTc duration (e.g., Congenital Short QT Syndrome or patients with a family \nhistory of such a syndrome).\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment with Inovelon. \nPhysicians should try to ensure that appropriate contraception is used, and should use clinical \njudgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives, or the doses of the oral contraceptive \ncomponents, are adequate, based on the individual patients clinical situation (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).\n\n\n\n20\n\nParahydroxybenzoates\n\nInovelon oral suspension contains parahydroxybenzoates which may cause allergic reactions (possibly \ndelayed).\n\nSorbitol\n\nInovelon oral suspension also contains sorbitol and, therefore, should not be administered to patients \nwith rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance.\n\nSuicidal ideation\n\nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic \nmedicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The \nmechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an \nincreased risk for Inovelon.\n\nTherefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect rufinamide\n\nOther antiepileptic medicinal products\nRufinamide concentrations are not subject to clinically relevant changes on co-administration with \nknown enzyme inducing antiepileptic medicinal products.\n\nFor patients on Inovelon treatment who have administration of valproate initiated, significant increases \nin rufinamide plasma concentrations may occur. Therefore, consideration should be given to a dose \nreduction of Inovelon in patients who are initiated on valproate therapy (see section 4.2).\n\nThe addition or withdrawal of these medicinal products or adjusting of the dose of these medicinal \nproducts during rufinamide therapy may require an adjustment in dosage of rufinamide (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nNo significant changes in rufinamide concentration are observed following co-administration with \nlamotrigine, topiramate or benzodiazepines.\n\nPotential for rufinamide to affect other medicinal products\n\nOther antiepileptic medicinal products\nThe pharmacokinetic interactions between rufinamide and other antiepileptic medicinal products have \nbeen evaluated in patients with epilepsy, using population pharmacokinetic modelling. Rufinamide \nappears not to have a clinically relevant effect on carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, \ntopiramate, phenytoin or valproate steady state concentrations.\n\nOral contraceptives\nCo-administration of rufinamide 800 mg twice daily and a combined oral contraceptive \n(ethinyloestradiol 35 \u03bcg and norethindrone 1 mg) for 14 days resulted in a mean decrease in the \nethinyl estradiol AUC0-24 of 22% and in norethindrone AUC0-24 of 14%. Studies with other oral or \nimplant contraceptives have not been conducted. Women of child-bearing potential using hormonal \ncontraceptives are advised to use an additional safe and effective contraceptive method (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.6).\n\n\n\n21\n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes\nRufinamide is metabolised by hydrolysis, and is not metabolised to any notable degree by cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. Furthermore, rufinamide does not inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes \n(see section 5.2). Thus, clinically significant interactions mediated through inhibition of cytochrome \nP450 system by rufinamide are unlikely to occur. Rufinamide has been shown to induce the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 and may therefore reduce the plasma concentrations of substances \nwhich are metabolised by this enzyme. The effect was modest to moderate. The mean \nCYP3A4 activity, assessed as clearance of triazolam, was increased by 55% after 11 days of treatment \nwith rufinamide 400 mg twice daily. The exposure of triazolam was reduced by 36%. Higher \nrufinamide doses may result in a more pronounced induction. It may not be excluded that rufinamide \nmay also decrease the exposure of substances metabolised by other enzymes, or transported by \ntransport proteins such as P-glycoprotein.\n\nIt is recommended that patients treated with substances that are metabolised by the CYP3A4 enzyme \nsystem are to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the start of, or after the end of treatment with \nrufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A dose adjustment of the concomitantly \nadministered medicinal product may need to be considered. These recommendations should also be \nconsidered when rufinamide is used concomitantly with substances with a narrow therapeutic window \nsuch as warfarin and digoxin.\n\nA specific interaction study in healthy subjects revealed no influence of rufinamide at a dose \nof 400 mg twice daily on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine, a CYP1A2 substrate.\n\nNo data on the interaction of rufinamide with alcohol are available.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general:\nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. In the treated \npopulation, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy; however, the extent to \nwhich the treatment and/or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.\n\nMoreover, effective antiepileptic therapy should not be interrupted abruptly, since the aggravation of \nthe illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. AED treatment during pregnancy should be \ncarefully discussed with the treating physician.\n\nRisk related to rufinamide:\nStudies in animals revealed no teratogenic effect, but foetotoxicity in the presence of maternal toxicity \nwas observed (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.\n\nFor rufinamide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.\n\nTaking these data into consideration, rufinamide should not be used during pregnancy, or in women of \nchildbearing age not using contraceptive measures, unless clearly necessary.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment with rufinamide. \nPhysicians should try to ensure that appropriate contraception is used, and should use clinical \njudgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives, or the doses of the oral contraceptive \ncomponents, are adequate based on the individual patients clinical situation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nIf women treated with rufinamide plan to become pregnant, the continued use of this product should \nbe carefully weighed. During pregnancy, interruption of an effective antiepileptic can be detrimental \nto both the mother and the foetus if it results in aggravation of the illness.\n\n\n\n22\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known if rufinamide is excreted in human breast milk. Due to the potential harmful effects for \nthe breast-fed infant, breast-feeding should be avoided during maternal treatment with rufinamide.\n\nFertility\n\nNo data are available on the effects on fertility following treatment with rufinamide.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nInovelon may cause dizziness, somnolence and blurred vision. Depending on the individual \nsensitivity, rufinamide may have a minor to major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients must be advised to exercise caution during activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g., \ndriving or operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe clinical development program has included over 1,900 patients, with different types of epilepsy, \nexposed to rufinamide. The most commonly reported adverse reactions overall were headache, \ndizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions observed at a higher \nincidence than placebo in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were somnolence and vomiting. \nAdverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The discontinuation rate in \nLennox-Gastaut syndrome due to adverse reactions was 8.2% for patients receiving rufinamide \nand 0% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in \ndiscontinuation from the rufinamide treatment group were rash and vomiting.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than placebo, during the Lennox-Gastaut \nsyndrome double-blind studies or in the overall rufinamide-exposed population, are listed in the table \nbelow by MedDRA preferred term, system organ class and by frequency.\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).\n\nSystem Organ \nClass Very Common Common Uncommon Rare\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nPneumonia\nInfluenza\nNasopharyngitis\nEar infection\nSinusitis\nRhinitis\n\nImmune system \ndisorders Hypersensitivity*\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nAnorexia\nEating disorder\nDecreased appetite\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nAnxiety\n\nInsomnia\n\nNervous system Somnolence* Status epilepticus*\n\n\n\n23\n\nSystem Organ \nClass Very Common Common Uncommon Rare\ndisorders Headache Convulsion\n\nDizziness* Coordination \nAbnormal*\nNystagmus\nPsychomotor \nhyperactivity\nTremor\n\nEye Disorders Diplopia\nVision blurred\n\nEar and \nLabyrinth \ndisorders\n\nVertigo\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nEpistaxis\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nNausea Abdominal pain \nupper\n\nVomiting Constipation\nDyspepsia\nDiarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nHepatic enzyme \nincrease\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash*\nAcne\n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue and bone \ndisorders\n\nBack pain\n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders\n\nOligomenorrhoea\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nFatigue Gait disturbance*\n\nInvestigations Weight decrease\n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\nHead injury\nContusion\n\n*Cross reference to section 4.4.\n\nAdditional information on special populations\n\nPaediatric Population (age 1 to less than 4 years)\nIn a multicentre, open-label study comparing the addition of rufinamide to any other AED of the \ninvestigator\u2019s choice to the existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs in paediatric patients, 1 to less \nthan 4 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS, 25 patients, of which 10 subjects were \naged 1 to 2 years, were exposed to rufinamide as adjunctive therapy for 24 weeks at a dose of up \nto 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 divided doses. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment \ngroup (occurring in \u2265 10% of subjects) were upper respiratory tract infection and vomiting (28.0% \n\n\n\n24\n\neach), pneumonia and somnolence (20.0% each), sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough and pyrexia \n(16.0% each), and bronchitis, constipation, nasal congestion, rash, irritability and decreased appetite \n(12.0% each). The frequency, type and severity of these adverse reactions were similar to that in \nchildren 4 years of age and older, adolescents and adults. Age characterisation in patients less \nthan 4 years was not identified in the limited safety database due to small number of patients in the \nstudy.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAfter an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. \nThere is no specific antidote for rufinamide. Treatment should be supportive and may include \nhaemodialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nMultiple dosing of 7,200 mg/day was associated with no major signs or symptoms.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives; ATC code: N03AF03.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRufinamide modulates the activity of sodium channels, prolonging their inactive state. Rufinamide is \nactive in a range of animal models of epilepsy.\n\nClinical experience\n\nInovelon (rufinamide tablets) was administered in a double blind, placebo-controlled study, at doses of \nup to 45 mg/kg/day for 84 days, to 139 patients with inadequately controlled seizures associated with \nLennox-Gastaut Syndrome (including both atypical absence seizures and drop attacks). Male and \nfemale patients (between 4 and 30 years of age) were eligible if they had a history of multiple seizure \ntypes, which had to include atypical absence seizures and drop attacks (i.e., tonic\u2013atonic or astatic \nseizures); were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant fixed dose antiepileptic medicinal products; a \nminimum of 90 seizures in the month before the 28-day baseline period; an EEG within 6 months of \nstudy entry demonstrating a pattern of slow spike-and-wave complexes (2.5 Hz); a weight of at \nleast 18 kg; and a CT scan or MRI study confirming the absence of a progressive lesion. All seizures \nwere classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy Revised Classification of \nSeizures. As it is difficult for caregivers to precisely separate tonic and atonic seizures, the \ninternational expert panel of child neurologists agreed to group these seizure types and call them \ntonic\u2013atonic seizures or \u201cdrop attacks\u201d. As such, drop attacks were used as one of the primary end \npoints. A significant improvement was observed for all three primary variables: the percentage change \nin total seizure frequency per 28 days during the maintenance phase relative to baseline (-35.8% on \nInovelon vs. \u20131.6% on placebo, p=0.0006), the number of tonic-atonic seizures (-42.9% on Inovelon \nvs. 2.2% on placebo, p=0.0002), and the seizure severity rating from the Global Evaluation performed \nby the parent/guardian at the end of the double-blind phase (much or very much improved in 32.2% on \nInovelon vs. 14.5% on the placebo arm, p=0.0041).\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25\n\nAdditionally, Inovelon (rufinamide oral suspension) was administered in a multicentre, open-label \nstudy comparing the addition of rufinamide to the addition of any other AED of the investigator\u2019s \nchoice to the existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs in paediatric patients, 1 to less than 4 years of age with \ninadequately controlled LGS. In this study, 25 patients were exposed to rufinamide as adjunctive \ntherapy for 24 weeks at a dose of up to 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 divided doses. A total of 12 patients \nreceived any-other AED at the investigator\u2019s discretion in the control arm. The study was mainly \ndesigned for safety and not adequately powered to show a difference with regards to the seizure \nefficacy variables. The adverse event profile was similar to that in children 4 years of age and older, \nadolescents, and adults. In addition, the study investigated the cognitive development, behaviour and \nlanguage development of subjects treated with rufinamide compared to subjects receiving\nany-other-AED. The Least Square mean change of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) Total \nProblems score after 2 years of treatment were 53.75 for the any other AED group and 56.35 for the \nrufinamide group (LS mean difference [95% CI] +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; p=0.6928), and the difference \nbetween treatments was -2.776 (95% CI: -13.3, 7.8, p=0.5939).\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling demonstrated that the reduction of total and \ntonic-atonic seizure frequencies, the improvement of the global evaluation of seizure severity and the \nincrease in probability of reduction of seizure frequency were dependent on rufinamide\nconcentrations.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nMaximum plasma levels are reached approximately 6 hours after administration. Peak concentration \n(Cmax) and plasma AUC of rufinamide increase less than proportionally with doses in both fasted and \nfed healthy subjects and in patients, probably due to dose-limited absorption behaviour. After single \ndoses, food increases the bioavailability (AUC) of rufinamide by approximately 34% and the peak \nplasma concentration by 56%.\n\nInovelon oral suspension and Inovelon film-coated tablets have been demonstrated to be \nbioequivalent.\n\nDistribution\n\nIn in -vitro studies, only a small fraction of rufinamide (34%) was bound to human serum proteins \nwith albumin accounting for approximately 80% of this binding. This indicates minimal risk of \ndrug-drug interactions by displacement from binding sites during concomitant administration of other \nsubstances. Rufinamide was evenly distributed between erythrocytes and plasma.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nRufinamide is almost exclusively eliminated by metabolism. The main pathway of metabolism is \nhydrolysis of the carboxylamide group to the pharmacologically inactive acid derivative CGP 47292. \nCytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is very minor. The formation of small amounts of glutathione \nconjugates cannot be completely excluded.\n\nRufinamide has demonstrated little or no significant capacity in -vitro to act as a competitive or \nmechanism-based inhibitor of the following human P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 or CYP4A9/11-2.\n\nElimination\n\nThe plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6-10 hours in healthy subjects and patients with \nepilepsy. When given twice daily at 12-hourly intervals, rufinamide accumulates to the extent \npredicted by its terminal half-life, indicating that the pharmacokinetics of rufinamide are \ntime-independent (i.e. no autoinduction of metabolism).\n\n\n\n26\n\nIn a radiotracer study in three healthy volunteers, the parent compound (rufinamide) was the main \nradioactive component in plasma, representing about 80% of the total radioactivity, and the metabolite \nCGP 47292 constituting only about 15%. Renal excretion was the predominant route of elimination \nfor active substance related material, accounting for 84.7% of the dose.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nThe bioavailability of rufinamide is dependent on dose. As dose increases, the bioavailability \ndecreases.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups\n\nSex\nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling has been used to evaluate the influence of sex on the \npharmacokinetics of rufinamide. Such evaluations indicate that sex does not affect the \npharmacokinetics of rufinamide to a clinically relevant extent.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of a single 400 mg dose of rufinamide were not altered in subjects with chronic \nand severe renal failure compared to healthy volunteers. However, plasma levels were reduced by \napproximately 30% when haemodialysis was applied after administration of rufinamide, suggesting \nthat this may be a useful procedure in case of overdose (see sections 4.2 and 4.9).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment and therefore Inovelon should not \nbe administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\nA pharmacokinetic study in older healthy volunteers did not show a significant difference in \npharmacokinetic parameters compared with younger adults.\n\nChildren (1-12 years)\nChildren generally have lower clearance of rufinamide than adults, and this difference is related to \nbody size with rufinamide clearance increasing with body weight.\n\nA recent population PK analysis of rufinamide on data pooled from 139 subjects (115 LGS patients \nand 24 healthy subjects), including 83 paediatric LGS patients (10 patients \naged 1 to < 2 years, 14 patients aged 2 to < 4 years, 14 patients aged 4 to < 8 years, 21 patients \naged 8 to < 12 years and 24 patients aged 12 to < 18 years) indicated that when rufinamide is dosed on \na mg/kg/day basis in LGS subjects aged 1 to < 4 years, comparable exposure to that in LGS patients \naged \u2265 4 years, in which efficacy has been demostrated, is achieved.\n\nStudies in new-born infants or infants and toddlers under 1 year of age have not been conducted.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nConventional safety pharmacology studies revealed no special hazards at clinically relevant doses.\n\nToxicities observed in dogs at levels similar to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose \nwere liver changes, including bile thrombi, cholestasis and liver enzyme elevations thought to be \nrelated to increased bile secretion in this species. No evidence of an associated risk was identified in \nthe rat and monkey repeat dose toxicity studies.\n\nIn reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, there were reductions in foetal growth and \nsurvival, and some stillbirths secondary to maternal toxicity. However, no effects on morphology and \n\n\n\n27\n\nfunction, including learning or memory, were observed in the offspring. Rufinamide was not \nteratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits.\n\nThe toxicity profile of rufinamide in juvenile animals was similar to that in adult animals. Decreased \nbody weight gain was observed in both juvenile and adult rats and dogs. Mild toxicity in the liver was \nobserved in juvenile as well as in adult animals at exposure levels lower than or similar to those \nreached in patients. Reversibility of all findings was demonstrated after stopping treatment.\n\nRufinamide was not genotoxic and had no carcinogenic potential. An adverse effect not observed in \nclinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with \npossible relevance to human use, was myelofibrosis of the bone marrow in the mouse carcinogenicity \nstudy. Benign bone neoplasms (osteomas) and hyperostosis seen in mice were considered a result of \nthe activation of a mouse specific virus by fluoride ions released during the oxidative metabolism of \nrufinamide.\n\nRegarding the immunotoxic potential, small thymus and thymic involution were observed in dogs in \na 13-week study with significant response at the high dose in male. In the 13-week study, female bone \nmarrow and lymphoid changes are reported at the high dose with a weak incidence. In rats, decreased \ncellularity of the bone marrow and thymic atrophy were observed only in the carcinogenicity study.\n\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA):\n\nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that rufinamide is very persistent in the \nenvironment (see section 6.6).\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask the doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to the doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Inovelon is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Inovelon\n3. How to use Inovelon\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Inovelon\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Inovelon is and what it is used for\n\nInovelon contains a medicine called rufinamide. It belongs to a group of medicines called \nantiepileptics, which are used to treat epilepsy (a condition where someone has seizures or fits).\n\nInovelon is used with other medicines to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in \nadults, adolescents and children from 1 year of age. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is the name given to a \ngroup of severe epilepsies in which you may experience repeated seizures of various types.\nInovelon has been given to you by your doctor to reduce the number of your seizures or fits.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Inovelon\n\nDo not take Inovelon:\n\n- if you are allergic to rufinamide or triazole derivatives or any of the other ingredients of \nInovelon (listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist if:\n\n- you have Congenital Short QT Syndrome or a family history of such a syndrome (electrical\ndisturbance of the heart), as taking rufinamide could make it worse.\n\n- you suffer from liver problems. There is limited information on the use of rufinamide in this \ngroup, so the dose of your medicine may need to be increased more slowly. If your liver disease \nis severe the doctor may decide Inovelon is not recommended for you.\n\n- you get a skin rash or fever. These could be signs of an allergic reaction. See the doctor \nimmediately as very occasionally this may become serious.\n\n\n\n47\n\n- you suffer an increase in the number or severity or duration of your seizures, you should contact\nthe doctor immediately if this happens.\n\n- you experience difficulty walking, abnormal movement, dizziness or sleepiness inform the \ndoctor, if any of these happen.\n\n- if you take this medicine and have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact \nyour doctor or go to a hospital straight away (see section 4).\n\nConsult the doctor, even if these events occurred at any time in the past.\n\nChildren\nInovelon should not be given to children younger than 1 year of age since there is not enough \ninformation on its use in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and Inovelon\n\nTell the doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. If you are taking the following medicines: phenobarbital, \nfosphenytoin, phenytoin or primidone, you may need to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the \nstart of, or after the end of treatment with rufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A \nchange in the dose of the other medicines may be needed as they may become slightly less effective \nwhen given with rufinamide.\n\nAntiepileptic medicines and Inovelon\n\nIf the doctor prescribes or recommends an additional treatment for epilepsy (e.g., valproate) you must \ntell the doctor you are taking Inovelon as the dose may need adjusting.\n\nAdults and children taking valproate at the same time as rufinamide will result in high levels of\nrufinamide in the blood. Tell your doctor if you are taking valproate as the dose of Inovelon may need \nto be reduced by your doctor.\n\nTell the doctor if you are taking hormonal/oral contraceptives, e.g., \u201cThe pill\u201d. Inovelon may make the \npill not effective at preventing pregnancy.

What Inovelon is and what it is used for\n\nInovelon contains a medicine called rufinamide. It belongs to a group of medicines called \nantiepileptics, which are used to treat epilepsy (a condition where someone has seizures or fits).\n\nInovelon is used with other medicines to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in \nadults, adolescents and children from 1 year of age. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is the name given to a \ngroup of severe epilepsies in which you may experience repeated seizures of various types.\n\nInovelon has been given to you by your doctor to reduce the number of your seizures or fits.\n\n2.

See the doctor \nimmediately as very occasionally this may become serious.\n\n- you suffer an increase in the number or severity or duration of your seizures, you should contact \nthe doctor immediately if this happens.\n\n- you experience difficulty walking, abnormal movement, dizziness or sleepiness inform the \ndoctor, if any of these happen.\n\n\n\n54\n\n- if you take this medicine and have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact \nyour doctor or go to a hospital straight away (see section 4).\n\nConsult the doctor, even if these events occurred at any time in the past.\n\nChildren\n\nInovelon should not be given to children younger than 1 year of age since there is not enough \ninformation on its use in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and Inovelon\n\nTell the doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. If you are taking the following medicines: phenobarbital, \nfosphenytoin, phenytoin or primidone, you may need to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the \nstart of, or after the end of treatment with rufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A \nchange in the dose of the other medicines may be needed as they may become slightly less effective \nwhen given with rufinamide.\n\nAntiepileptic medicines and Inovelon\n\nIf the doctor prescribes or recommends an additional treatment for epilepsy (e.g., valproate) you must \ntell the doctor you are taking Inovelon as the dose may need adjusting.\n\nAdults and children taking valproate at the same time as rufinamide will result in high levels of \nrufinamide in the blood. Tell your doctor if you are taking valproate as the dose of Inovelon may need \nto be reduced by your doctor.\n\nTell the doctor if you are taking hormonal/oral contraceptives, e.g., \u201cThe pill\u201d. Inovelon may make the \npill not effective at preventing pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that you use an additional \nsafe and effective contraceptive method (such as a barrier method, e.g., condoms) when taking \nInovelon.\n\nTell the doctor if you are taking the blood thinner \u2013 warfarin. The doctor may need to adjust the dose.\n\nTell the doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat heart conditions). The doctor may \nneed to adjust the dose.\n\nInovelon with food and drink\n\nSee section 3 \u2013 \u2018How to use Inovelon\u2019 for advice on taking Inovelon with food and drink.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\n\nIf you are pregnant, or think you might be pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant, ask the doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking Inovelon. You must only take Inovelon during your pregnancy if \nthe doctor tells you to.\n\nYou are advised not to breast-feed while taking Inovelon, as it is not known if rufinamide will be \npresent in breast milk.\n\nIf you are a woman of childbearing age, you must use contraceptive measures while taking Inovelon.\n\nAsk the doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine at the same time as Inovelon.\n\n\n\n55\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nInovelon may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of \ntreatment or after a dose increase. If this happens to you, do not drive or operate machinery.\n\nInovelon contains sorbitol\n\nPatients with rare, hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine.\n\nInovelon contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl parahydroxybenzoate (E216)\n\nThese ingredients may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).\n\n3.

not take inovelon: - if you are allergic to rufinamide or triazole derivatives or any of the other ingredients of inovelon (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist if: - you have congenital short qt syndrome or a family history of such a syndrome (electrical disturbance of the heart), as taking rufinamide could make it worse. - you suffer from liver problems. there is limited information on the use of rufinamide in this group, so the dose of your medicine may need to be increased more slowly. if your liver disease is severe the doctor may decide inovelon is not recommended for you. - you get a skin rash or fever. these could be signs of an allergic reaction. see the doctor immediately as very occasionally this may become serious. - you suffer an increase in the number or severity or duration of your seizures, you should contact the doctor immediately if this happens. - you experience difficulty walking, abnormal movement, dizziness or sleepiness inform the doctor, if any of these happen. - if you take this medicine and have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away (see section 4). consult the doctor, even if these events occurred at any time in the past. children inovelon should not be given to children younger than 1 year of age since there is not enough information on its use in this age group. other medicines and inovelon tell the doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. if you are taking the following medicines: phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, phenytoin or primidone, you may need to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the start of, or after the end of treatment with rufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. a change in the dose of the other medicines may be needed as they may become slightly less effective when given with rufinamide. antiepileptic medicines and inovelon if the doctor prescribes or recommends an additional treatment for epilepsy (e.g., valproate) you must tell the doctor you are taking inovelon as the dose may need adjusting. adults and children taking valproate at the same time as rufinamide will result in high levels of rufinamide in the blood. tell your doctor if you are taking valproate as the dose of inovelon may need to be reduced by your doctor. tell the doctor if you are taking hormonal/oral contraceptives, e.g., \"the pill\". inovelon may make the pill not effective at preventing pregnancy. therefore, it is recommended that you use an additional safe and effective contraceptive method (such as a barrier method, e.g., condoms) when taking inovelon. tell the doctor if you are taking the blood thinner warfarin. the doctor may need to adjust the dose. tell the doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat heart conditions). the doctor may need to adjust the dose. inovelon with food and drink see section 3 'how to use inovelon' for advice on taking inovelon with food and drink. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant, or think you might be pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant, ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking inovelon. you must only take inovelon during your pregnancy if the doctor tells you to. you are advised not to breast-feed while taking inovelon, as it is not known if rufinamide will be present in breast milk. if you are a woman of childbearing age, you must use contraceptive measures while taking inovelon. ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine at the same time as inovelon. driving and using machines inovelon may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of treatment or after a dose increase. if this happens to you, do not drive or operate machinery. inovelon contains lactose if you have been told by the doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact the doctor before taking this medicinal product.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "inovelon", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},
