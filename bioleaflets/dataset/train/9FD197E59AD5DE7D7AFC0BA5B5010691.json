This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nSymtuza 800 mg/150 mg/200 mg/10 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 800 mg of darunavir (as ethanolate), 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of\nemtricitabine, and 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (as fumarate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet.\n\nYellow to yellowish-brown capsule shaped tablet of 22 mm x 11 mm, debossed with \u201c8121\u201d on one \nside and \u201cJG\u201d on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSymtuza is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in \nadults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg).\nGenotypic testing should guide the use of Symtuza (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV-1 infection.\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose regimen in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least \n40 kg, is one tablet taken once daily with food.\n\nART-na\u00efve patients\nThe recommended dose regimen is one film-coated tablet of Symtuza once daily taken with food.\n\nART-experienced patients\nOne film-coated tablet of Symtuza once daily taken with food may be used in patients with prior \nexposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated mutations \n(DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count \n\u2265 100 cells x 106/L (see section 5.1).\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V, L89V.\n\nAdvice on missed doses\nIf a dose of Symtuza is missed within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be \ninstructed to take the prescribed dose of Symtuza with food as soon as possible. If a missed dose is \nnoticed later than 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, it should not be taken and the patient should \nresume the usual dosing schedule.\n\n\n\n3\n\nIn case a patient vomits within 1 hour of taking the medicine, another dose of Symtuza should be \ntaken with food as soon as possible. If a patient vomits more than 1 hour after taking the medicine, the \npatient does not need to take another dose of Symtuza until the next regularly scheduled time.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nLimited information is available in this population, and, therefore, Symtuza should be used with \ncaution in patients above 65 years of age (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Symtuza is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, however, Symtuza should be used with caution in these \npatients, as the darunavir and cobicistat components of Symtuza are metabolised by the hepatic \nsystem.\n\nSymtuza has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), \ntherefore, Symtuza must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 \nand 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Symtuza is required in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate \naccording to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (eGFRCG) \u2265 30 mL/min.\n\nSymtuza should not be initiated in patients with eGFRCG < 30 mL/min, as there are no data available \nregarding the use of Symtuza in this population (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\nSymtuza should be discontinued in patients with eGFRCG that declines below 30 mL/min during \ntreatment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Symtuza in children aged 3-11 years, or weighing < 40 kg, have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available.\n\nSymtuza should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of age because of safety concerns (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.3).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat (two of the components of Symtuza) during pregnancy results in \nlow darunavir exposure (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Therefore, therapy with Symtuza should not be \ninitiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with Symtuza should be \nswitched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nSymtuza should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2). The tablet should not be \ncrushed.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.\n\nCo-administration with the following medicinal products due to the potential for loss of therapeutic \neffect (see section 4.5):\n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- rifampicin\n\n\n\n4\n\n- lopinavir/ritonavir\n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum)\n\nCo-administration with the following medicinal products due to the potential for serious and/or \nlife-threatening adverse reactions (see section 4.5):\n- alfuzosin\n- amiodarone, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, ranolazine\n- colchicine when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5)\n- rifampicin\n- ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine)\n- dapoxetine\n- domperidone\n- naloxegol\n- pimozide, quetiapine, sertindole, lurasidone (see section 4.5)\n- triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, \n\nsee section 4.5)\n- sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, avanafil,\n\nsimvastatin, lovastatin and lomitapide (see section 4.5)\n- dabigatran, ticagrelor\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been proven to substantially \nreduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nART-experienced patients\nSymtuza should not be used in treatment-experienced patients with one or more DRV-RAMs (see \nsection 5.1) or with HIV-1 RNA \u2265 100,000 copies/mL or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/L.\n\nPregnancy\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg during the second and third trimester has been shown \nto result in low darunavir exposure, with a reduction of around 90% in Cmin levels (see section 5.2). \nCobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting. The substantial reduction in \ndarunavir exposure may result in virological failure and an increased risk of mother to child \ntransmission of HIV infection. Therefore, therapy with Symtuza should not be initiated during \npregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with Symtuza should be switched to an \nalternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6).\n\nPatients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus\n\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Symtuza in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) \nhave not been established. Tenofovir alafenamide is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV).\n\nIn case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for these medicinal products.\n\nDiscontinuation of Symtuza therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated \nwith severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue \nSymtuza should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several \nmonths after stopping treatment. If appropriate, initiation of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. In \npatients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since \npost-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation.\n\n\n\n5\n\nSymtuza should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil (e.g. fumarate, phosphate, or succinate), lamivudine, or adefovir dipivoxil used for the \ntreatment of HBV infection.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction\n\nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable \ndegree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV\nnegative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues. The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactataemia, hyperlipasaemia). These events are often transitory. Some late-onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether the neurological \ndisorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside \nand nucleotide analogues, even HIV negative children, should have clinical and laboratory follow-up \nand should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or \nsymptoms. These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy \nin pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.\n\nElderly\n\nAs limited information is available on the use of Symtuza in patients aged 65 and over, caution should \nbe exercised, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function and of concomitant disease \nor other therapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nDrug-induced hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with \ndarunavir/ritonavir. During the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N = 3,063), \nhepatitis was reported in 0.5% of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with \ndarunavir/ritonavir. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic hepatitis B or C, \nhave an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe and potentially fatal hepatic \nadverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the \nrelevant product information for these medicinal products.\n\nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with Symtuza and \npatients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered \nin patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment \nelevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of Symtuza treatment.\n\nIf there is evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of \nliver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver \ntenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients using Symtuza, interruption or discontinuation of treatment \nshould be considered promptly (see section 5.3).\n\nNephrotoxicity\n\nA potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to \ndosing with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3).\n\nRenal impairment\n\nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular\nsecretion of creatinine. This effect on serum creatinine, leading to a decrease in the estimated\ncreatinine clearance, should be taken into consideration when Symtuza is administered to patients, in \nwhom the estimated creatinine clearance is used to guide aspects of their clinical \nmanagement,including adjusting doses of co-administered medicinal products. For more information \nconsult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPatients with co-existing conditions\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy of Symtuza or its components have not been established in patients with \nsevere underlying liver disorders. Symtuza is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. Due to an increase in the unbound darunavir plasma concentrations, Symtuza should be \nused with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nHaemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with HIV PIs. In some patients \nadditional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with HIV PIs was \ncontinued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been \nsuggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should, \ntherefore, be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.\n\nSevere skin reactions\n\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N = 3,063), severe skin reactions, which \nmay be accompanied with fever and/or elevations of transaminases, have been reported in 0.4% of \npatients. DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome has been rarely (< 0.1%) reported, and during post-marketing experience toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Symtuza should be \ndiscontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include, \nbut are not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or \njoint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia.\n\nSulphonamide allergy\n\nDarunavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. Symtuza should be used with caution in patients with a \nknown sulphonamide allergy.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\n\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nOsteonecrosis\n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome\n\nIn HIV infected patients treated with CART, immune reactivation syndrome has been reported. In HIV \ninfected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an inflammatory \nreaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical \nconditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first \nweeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples include cytomegalovirus retinitis, \ngeneralised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii\n\n\n\n7\n\n(formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. In addition, reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has \nbeen observed in clinical trials with darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir.\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nOpportunistic infections\n\nPatients receiving Symtuza or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic \ninfections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical \nobservation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases.\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\n\nCo-administration of other medicinal products\nSymtuza is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and should\nnot be administered with other antiretroviral products (see section 4.5). Symtuza should not be \nadministered concomitantly with medicinal products requiring pharmacokinetic enhancement with \nritonavir or cobicistat. Symtuza should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products \ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate, phosphate or succinate), lamivudine, or adefovir \ndipivoxil used for the treatment of HBV infection.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nSymtuza should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of age (see sections 4.2 and 5.3).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo drug interaction trials have been performed using Symtuza. Interactions that have been identified \nin studies with individual components of Symtuza, i.e. with darunavir (in combination with low dose \nritonavir), cobicistat, emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide, determine the interactions that may occur \nwith Symtuza.\n\nDarunavir and cobicistat\n\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of P-gp. Cobicistat \nis a mechanism based inhibitor of CYP3A, and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. Cobicistat inhibits the \ntransporters p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Co-administration of \ncobicistat with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters can result in increased \nplasma concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products. Cobicistat is not expected to inhibit \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. Cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP1A2, \nCYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1, or P-gp (MDR1).\n\nCo-administration of Symtuza and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in \nincreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their\ntherapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Symtuza, therefore, must not be combined with medicinal \nproducts that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic \nexposure is associated with serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see \nsection 4.3 or table below).\n\nDarunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity \nwould be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and cobicistat, resulting in lowered plasma \nconcentrations of darunavir and cobicistat (e.g. efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, \nrifampicin, rifapentine, rifabutin, St. John\u2019s wort) (see section 4.3 and interaction table below).\n\n\n\n8\n\nCo-administration of Symtuza and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the \nclearance of darunavir and cobicistat and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir \nand cobicistat (e.g. azole antifungals like clotrimazole). These interactions are described in the \ninteraction table below.\n\nUnlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \nUGT1A1. If switching from ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer to this regimen with cobicistat, caution \nis required during the first two weeks of treatment with Symtuza, particularly if doses of any \nconcomitantly administered medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir.\n\nEmtricitabine\n\nIn vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for \nCYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.\n\nEmtricitabine did not inhibit the glucuronidation reaction of a non-specific UGT substrate in vitro. \nCo-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular \nsecretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co-administered medicinal product. \nMedicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide\n\nTenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP). Medicinal products that strongly affect P-gp activity and BCRP may lead to changes in \ntenofovir alafenamide absorption. Medicinal products that induce P-gp activity (e.g., rifampicin, \nrifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are expected to decrease the absorption of tenofovir \nalafenamide, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide, which may lead to \nloss of therapeutic effect of tenofovir alafenamide and development of resistance. Co-administration \nof tenofovir alafenamide with other medicinal products that inhibit P-gp (e.g., cobicistat, ritonavir, \nciclosporin) are expected to increase the absorption and plasma concentration of tenofovir \nalafenamide. It is not known whether the co-administration of tenofovir alafenamide and xanthine \noxidase inhibitors (e.g. febuxostat) would increase systemic exposure to tenofovir.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6 in vitro. It is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo. Tenofovir alafenamide is a substrate of \nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. The distribution of tenofovir alafenamide in the body may be \naffected by the activity of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.\n\nInteraction table\n\nExpected interactions between Symtuza with potential concomitant medicinal products are listed in \nTable 1 below and are based on the studies conducted with the components of Symtuza, as individual \nagents or combined, or are potential drug interactions that may occur.\n\nInteraction trials with the components of Symtuza have only been performed in adults.\n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer; therefore, there may be different recommendations for the use of darunavir \nwith concomitant medicines. Refer to the prescribing information for darunavir for further \ninformation.\n\nThe below list of examples of drug drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of \neach drug that is co-administered with Symtuza should be consulted for information related to the \nroute of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with \nregards to co-administration.\n\n\n\n9\n\nTable 1: Interactions between the individual components of Symtuza and other medicinal \nproducts\n\nINTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nInteraction Recommendations concerning \nco-administration\n\nALPHA ADRENORECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS\nAlfusozin Based on theoretical \n\nconsiderations\nDRV/COBI is expected to \nincrease alfusozin concentrations\n(CYP3A4 inhibition)\n\nThe concomitant use of Symtuza\nwith alfusozin is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3).\n\nANAESTHETIC\nAlfentanil Based on theoretical \n\nconsiderations DRV/COBI is \nexpected to increase alfentanil \nplasma concentrations.\n\nThe concomitant use with \nSymtuza may require to lower the \ndose of alfentanil and requires \nmonitoring for risks of prolonged \nor delayed respiratory depression.\n\nANTACIDS\nAluminium/magnesium \nhydroxide\nCalcium carbonate\n\nNo mechanistic interaction \nexpected based on theoretical \nconsiderations.\n\nSymtuza and antacids can be \nused concomitantly without dose \nadjustment.\n\nANTIANGINA/ANTIARRHYTHMIC\nDisopyramide\nFlecainide\nMexiletine\nPropafenone\nLidocaine (systemic)\n\nAmiodarone\nDronedarone\nIvabradine\nQuinidine\nRanolazine\n\nBased on theoretical \nconsiderations DRV/COBI is \nexpected to increase these \nantiarrhythmic plasma \nconcentrations.\n(CYP3A inhibition)\n\nCaution is warranted and \ntherapeutic concentration \nmonitoring, if available, is \nrecommended for these \nantiarrhythmics when \nco-administered with Symtuza.\n\nCo-administration of \namiodarone, dronedarone,\nivabradine, quinidine, or \nranolazine and Symtuza is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nDigoxin Based on theoretical \nconsiderations DRV/COBI is \nexpected to increase digoxin \nplasma concentrations.\n(P-glycoprotein inhibition)\n\nIt is recommended that the \nlowest possible dose of digoxin \nshould initially be given to \npatients on Symtuza.

As Symtuza contains darunavir, cobicistat, \nemtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, the adverse reactions associated with each of the individual \ncompounds may be expected.\n\nThe most frequent (> 5%) adverse reactions reported in treatment-na\u00efve patients in the Phase 2 (GS-\nUS-299-0102) and Phase 3 Study (AMBER, TMC114FD2HTX3001, Week 96 analysis) were \ndiarrhoea (22.6%), headache (13.1%), rash (12.7%), nausea (9.7%), fatigue (8.0%), and abdominal \npain (5.8%).\n\nThe most frequent (> 5%) adverse reactions reported in suppressed treatment-experienced patients \n(EMERALD Study TMC114IFD3013, Week 96 analysis) were diarrhoea (10.5%), headache (10.4%), \narthralgia (7.7%), abdominal pain (7.5%), fatigue (5.9%), and rash (5.1%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency category in Table 2. \nFrequency categories are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and not known (frequency cannot be \nestimated from the available data)\n\nTable 2\nMedDRA system organ class\nFrequency category\n\nAdverse reaction\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\ncommon anaemia\nImmune system disorders\ncommon (drug) hypersensitivity\nuncommon immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\n\n\n\n19\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\ncommon diabetes mellitus, anorexia, \n\nhypercholesterolaemia, low density lipoprotein\nincreased, hypertriglyceridaemia, \nhyperlipidaemia, dyslipidaemia\n\nuncommon hyperglycaemia\nPsychiatric disorders\ncommon abnormal dreams\nNervous system disorders\nvery common headache\ncommon dizziness\nGastrointestinal disorders\nvery common diarrhoea\ncommon vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal \n\ndistension, dyspepsia, flatulence\nuncommon pancreatitis acute, pancreatic enzymes increased\nHepatobiliary disorders\ncommon hepatic enzyme increased\nuncommon acute hepatitisa, cytolytic hepatitisa\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nvery common rash (including macular, maculopapular, \n\npapular, erythematous, pruritic rash, generalised \nrash, and allergic dermatitis)\n\ncommon pruritus, urticaria\nuncommon angioedema\nrare drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptomsa, Stevens-Johnson syndromea\n\nnot known toxic epidermal necrolysisa, acute generalised \nexanthematous pustulosisa\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\ncommon arthralgia, myalgia\nuncommon osteonecrosis\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nuncommon gynaecomastiaa\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\ncommon asthenia, fatigue\nInvestigations\ncommon increased blood creatinine\na\n\nAdditional adverse drug reactions only seen with darunavir/ritonavir in other trials or postmarketing experience\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRash\nRash is a common adverse drug reaction in patients treated with darunavir. Rash was mostly mild to \nmoderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of treatment and resolving with continued dosing \n(see section 4.4). In the Phase 2/3 trials in treatment-na\u00efve patients, 12.7% (59/465) of patients \nreceiving Symtuza experienced rash (most of which were grade 1), 1.5% (7/465) of patients \ndiscontinued treatment due to rash, of whom one for rash and hypersensitivity. In the Phase 3 trial in \nsuppressed treatment-experienced patients (EMERALD Study TMC114IFD3013), 5.1% (39/763) of \npatients receiving Symtuza experienced rash (most of which were grade 1), none discontinued \ntreatment due to rash.\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4).\n\n\n\n20\n\nIn the Phase 3 trial of Symtuza in treatment-na\u00efve patients, increases from baseline were observed in \nthe fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides at \nWeek 48 and 96 (see Table 3). The median increases from baseline were greater in the D/C/F/TAF \ngroup compared with the DRV/ cobicistat (COBI)+F/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) group at\nWeek 48.\n\nTable 3\n\nLipid Parameter Baseline Median\nMedian Increase From Baseline at\n\nWeek 48 \nD/C/F/TAF\n\nWeek 48\nD/C + F/TDF\n\nWeek 96*\nD/C/F/TAF\n\nTotal cholesterol \n(mmol/L)\n\n4.22 0.74 0.27 0.88\n\nLDL cholesterol \n(mmol/L)\n\n2.49 0.45 0.13 0.56\n\nHDL cholesterol \n(mmol/L)\n\n1.08 0.12 0.04 0.13\n\nTriglycerides \n(mmol/L)\n\n1.09 0.28 0.16 0.33\n\np < 0.001 for all 4 lipid parameters when comparing D/C/F/TAF versus D/C + F/TDF at Week 48\n* No comparator data available beyond Week 48\n\nMusculoskeletal abnormalities\nIncreased creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myalgia, myositis and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been \nreported with the use of HIV protease inhibitors, particularly in combination with NRTIs.\n\nOsteonecrosis\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of CART, an inflammatory \nreaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such \nas Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to \nonset is more variable, and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nBleeding in haemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac patients receiving \nantiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4).\n\nDecrease estimated creatinine clearance\nCobicistat increases serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without \naffecting renal glomerular function as assessed, for instance, by using Cystatin C (Cyst C) as filtration \nmarker.\n\nIn the Phase 3 trial of Symtuza in treatment-na\u00efve patients, increases in serum creatinine and decreases \nin eGFRCG occurred at the first on-treatment assessment (Week 2) and remained stable through \n96 weeks. At Week 48 changes from baseline were smaller with D/C/F/TAF than D/C+F/TDF. The \nmedian change in eGFRCG was -5.5 mL/min with D/C/F/TAF and -12.0 mL/min with D/C+F/TDF \n(p < 0.001). Using Cyst C as filtration marker, the median changes in estimated glomerular filtration \nrate calculated using the CKD-EPI (eGFRCKD-EPI CystC) formula were respectively 4.0 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 \nand 1.6 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 (p<0.001). At Week 96, the median change in eGFRCG was -5.2 mL/min with \nD/C/F/TAF. Using Cyst C as filtration marker, the median change in estimated glomerular filtration \nrate calculated using the CKD-EPI (eGFRCKD-EPI Cyst C) formula (N=22) was +4.4 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 with \nD/C/F/TAF. \n\n\n\n21\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety of Symtuza in paediatric patients has not been investigated. However,the safety of \ncomponents of Symtuza was evaluated through the clinical study TMC114-C230 (N = 12) for \ndarunavir with ritonavir and GS-US-292-0106 (N = 50) for a fixed dose combination containing\nelvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. The data from these studies showed \nthat the overall safety profile of components of Symtuza in paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years \nand weighing at least 40 kg was similar to that observed in the adult population (see section 5.1).\n\nOther special populations\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nLimited information is available on the use of Symtuza components in patients co-infected with \nhepatitis B and/or C virus.\n\nAmong 1,968 treatment-experienced patients receiving darunavir co-administered with ritonavir \n600/100 mg twice daily, 236 patients were co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were \nmore likely to have baseline and treatment emergent hepatic transaminase elevations than those \nwithout chronic viral hepatitis. The safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination \nwith elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet was evaluated in approximately 70 \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients currently receiving treatment for HIV in an open-label clinical study \n(GS-US-292-1249). Based on this limited experience, the safety profile of emtricitabine/tenofovir \nalafenamide in patients with HIV/HBV co-infection appears to be similar to that in patients with\nHIV-1 monoinfection (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of acute overdose with Symtuza is limited.\nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8).\n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Symtuza. Treatment of overdose with Symtuza consists \nof general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the \nclinical status of the patient.\n\nSince darunavir and cobicistat are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they will be \nsignificantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Emtricitabine can be removed by \nhaemodialysis, which removes approximately 30% of the emtricitabine dose over a 3 hour dialysis \nperiod starting within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing. Tenofovir is efficiently removed by \nhaemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 54%. It is not known whether \nemtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infection,\ncombinations ATC code: J05AR22\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease \n(KD of 4.5 x 10\n\n-12M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus \ninfected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles.\n\nCobicistat is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 of the CYP3A subfamily. Inhibition of \nCYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic exposure of CYP3A substrates, \nsuch as darunavir, where bioavailability is limited and half-life is shortened due to CYP3A-dependent \nmetabolism.\n\nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and nucleoside analogue of\n2\u2019-deoxycytidine. Emtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine \ntriphosphate. Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits HIV replication through incorporation into viral DNA \nby the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), which results in DNA chain-termination.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and phosphonoamidate \nprodrug of tenofovir (2\u2019-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue). Tenofovir alafenamide is \npermeable into cells and due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through \nhydrolysis by cathepsin A, tenofovir alafenamide is more efficient than tenofovir disoproxil in \nconcentrating tenofovir in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (including lymphocytes and \nother HIV target cells) and macrophages. Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated to the \npharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV \nreplication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV RT, which results in DNA \nchain-termination.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nDarunavir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide demonstrated additive to synergistic antiviral \neffects in two-drug combination studies in cell culture.\n\nDarunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory \nstrains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human PBMCs and human monocytes/macrophages \nwith median EC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to 5.0 ng/mL). Darunavir demonstrates \nantiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and group O \nprimary isolates with EC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 4.3 nM. These EC50 values are well below the \n50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 \u00b5M to > 100 \u00b5M.\n\nCobicistat has no detectable antiviral activity against HIV-1 and does not antagonise the antiviral \neffect of darunavir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir.\n\nThe antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI CCR5 cell line, and PBMCs. The EC50 values for emtricitabine \nwere in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 \u03bcM. Emtricitabine displayed antiviral activity in cell culture \nagainst HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 0.075 \u03bcM) and \nshowed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 1.5 \u03bcM).\n\nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 \nsubtype B was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage cells \nand CD4+-T lymphocytes. The EC50 values for tenofovir alafenamide were in the range of 2.0 to \n14.7 nM. Tenofovir alafenamide displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV-1 groups \n(M, N, and O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.10 to 12.0 nM) \nand showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.91 to 2.63 nM).\n\n\n\n23\n\nResistance\n\nIn vitro selection of darunavir-resistant virus from wild type HIV-1 was lengthy (> 3 years). The \nselected viruses were unable to grow in the presence of darunavir concentrations above 400 nM. \nViruses selected in these conditions and showing decreased susceptibility to darunavir (range: \n23-50-fold) harboured 2 to 4 amino acid substitutions in the protease gene. The decreased \nsusceptibility to darunavir of the emerging viruses in the selection experiment could not be explained \nby the emergence of these protease mutations.\n\nIn vivo, darunavir resistance-associated mutations (V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, \nL76V, I84V and L89V) in HIV-1 protease were derived from clinical trial data of ART-experienced \npatients, all of whom were protease inhibitor experienced.\n\nReduced susceptibility to emtricitabine is associated with M184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT.\n\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide express a K65R mutation in\nHIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has been transiently observed. HIV-1 isolates \nwith the K65R mutation have low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, tenofovir, \nand lamivudine.\n\nEmerging resistance in HIV-1 infected, treatment-na\u00efve and virologically suppressed patients\n\nOver 96 weeks of treatment in the Phase 3 studies TMC114FD2HTX3001 (AMBER) in treatment-\nna\u00efve patients and TMC114IFD3013 (EMERALD) in virologically suppressed treatment-experienced \npatients, resistance testing was performed on samples from patients experiencing protocol-defined \nvirologic failure (PDVF) and who had HIV-1 RNA \u2265400 copies/mL at failure or at later time points. \nEmerging resistance in the Symtuza groups is shown in Table 4. No DRV, primary PI, or TDF/TAF \nresistance-associated mutations were observed.\n\nTable 4: Emerging Resistance in AMBER and EMERALD Trial (Week 96)\n\nStudy\nTreatment \n\ngroup\nSubjects,\n\nn\n\nSubjects \nwith \n\nPDVF, \nn (%)\n\nSubjects \nwith PDVF \nevaluated \n\nfor \nresistance, \n\nn (%)\n\nSubjects with \u22651 emergent RAM, n (%)\n\nProtease Reverse transcriptase\n\nPrimary \nPI/DRV\n\nTDF/\nTAF FTC\n\nTMC114FD2HTX3001 Symtuza 362 15 (4.1) 9 (2.5) 0 0\n1\n\n(M184I/V)a\n\nTMC114IFD3013 Symtuza 763 24 (3.1) 4 (0.5) 0 0 0\n\nTotal Phase 3 Symtuza 1,125 39 (3.5) 13 (1.2) 0 0 1 (0.1)\na At Week 36 M184M/I/V observed, conferring resistance to FTC.

Virologic \nresponse was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load of at least 1.0 log10 versus \nbaseline (see Table 7).\n\nTable 7: Virologic Outcome in ART- na\u00efve Adolescents at Week 48 (TLOVR algorithm)\nTMC114-C230\n\nOutcomes at Week 48 Darunavir/ritonavir\n(N = 12)\n\nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mLa 83.3% (10)\nCD4+ percent median change from baseline 14\nCD4+ cell count mean change from baselineb 221\n\u2265 1.0 log10 decrease from baseline in plasma \nviral load\n\n100%\n\na\nImputations according to the TLOVR algorithm.\n\nb\nNon-completer is failure imputation: patients who discontinued prematurely are imputed with a change equal to 0.\n\nIn the study GS-US-292-0106, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and \ntenofovir alafenamide were evaluated in an open-label study in which 50 HIV-1 infected, \ntreatment-na\u00efve adolescents received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (10 mg) given with \nelvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet. Patients had a median age of 15 years \n(range: 12-17), and 56% were female, 12% were Asian, and 88% were Black. At baseline, median \nplasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.7 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 456 cells/mm\n\n3 (range: \n95-1,110), and median CD4+ % was 23% (range: 7-45%). Overall, 22% had baseline plasma HIV-1 \nRNA > 100,000 copies/mL. At 48 weeks, 92% (46/50) achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, similar \nto response rates in studies of treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adults. The mean increase from baseline \nin CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 224 cells/mm3. No emergent resistance to E/C/F/TAF \n(elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) was detected through Week 48.\n\n\n\n27\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSymtuza in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV-1 infection (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe bioavailability of all components of Symtuza was comparable to that when darunavir 800 mg, \ncobicistat 150 mg, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 200/10 mg were co-administered as \nseparate formulations; bioequivalence was established following single-dose administration under fed \nconditions in healthy subjects (N = 96).\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone was approximately 37% and \nincreased to approximately 82% in the presence of 100 mg twice daily ritonavir. The absolute \nbioavailability of the emtricitabine 200 mg capsule was 93%.\n\nAll components were rapidly absorbed following oral administration of Symtuza in healthy subjects. \nMaximum plasma concentrations of darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide\nwere achieved at 4.00, 4.00, 2.00, and 1.50 hours after dosing, respectively. The bioavailability of the \ncomponents of Symtuza was not affected when administered orally as a split tablet compared to \nadministration as a tablet swallowed whole.\n\nThe exposure to darunavir and cobicistat administered as the Symtuza was 30-45% lower and 16-29% \nlower, respectively, in fasted compared to fed condition. For emtricitabine, the Cmax was 1.26-fold \nhigher in a fasted condition, while the AUC was comparable in fed and fasted condition. For tenofovir \nalafenamide, the Cmax was 1.82-fold higher in fasted condition, while the AUC was 20% lower to \ncomparable in a fasted compared to fed condition. Symtuza tablets should be taken with food. The \ntype of food does not affect exposure to Symtuza.\n\nDistribution\n\nDarunavir\nDarunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma protein. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma \u03b11-acid \nglycoprotein.\n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of darunavir alone was 88.1 \u00b1 59.0 L \n(mean \u00b1 SD) and increased to 131 \u00b1 49.9 L (mean \u00b1 SD) in the presence of 100 mg twice-daily \nritonavir.\n\nCobicistat\nCobicistat is 97% to 98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean plasma to blood-drug \nconcentration ratio was approximately 2.\n\nEmtricitabine\nIn vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of \nconcentration over the range of 0.02-200 mcg/mL. At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to \nblood drug concentration ratio was approximately 1.0 and the mean semen to plasma drug \nconcentration ratio was approximately 4.0.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide\nIn vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is < 0.7% and is independent of concentration \nover the range of 0.01-25 mcg/mL. Ex vivo binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma \nproteins in samples collected during clinical studies was approximately 80%.\n\n\n\n28\n\nBiotransformation\n\nDarunavir\nIn vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that darunavir primarily \nundergoes oxidative metabolism. Darunavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic CYP system and \nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A4. A [14C]-darunavir trial in healthy volunteers showed that a \nmajority of the radioactivity in plasma after a single 400/100 mg darunavir with ritonavir dose was due \nto the parent active substance. At least 3 oxidative metabolites of darunavir have been identified in \nhumans; all showed activity that was at least 10-fold less than the activity of darunavir against wild \ntype HIV.\n\nCobicistat\nCobicistat is metabolised via CYP3A (major)- and CYP2D6 (minor)-mediated oxidation and does not \nundergo glucuronidation. Following oral administration of [14C]-cobicistat, 99% of circulating \nradioactivity in plasma was unchanged cobicistat. Low levels of metabolites are observed in urine and \nfeces and do not contribute to the CYP3A inhibitory activity of cobicistat.\n\nEmtricitabine\nIn vitro studies indicate that emtricitabine is not an inhibitor of human CYP enzymes. Following \nadministration of [14C]-emtricitabine, complete recovery of the emtricitabine dose was achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%). Thirteen percent of the dose was \nrecovered in the urine as three putative metabolites. The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes \noxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3\u2019-sulfoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and \nconjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2\u2019-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). No other \nmetabolites were identifiable.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide\nMetabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for \n> 80% of an oral dose. In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to \ntenofovir (major metabolite) by cathepsin A in PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV target \ncells) and macrophages; and by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes. In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is \nhydrolysed within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active \nmetabolite tenofovir diphosphate.\n\nIn vitro, tenofovir alafenamide is not metabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6. Tenofovir alafenamide is minimally metabolised by CYP3A4. Upon co-administration with \nthe moderate CYP3A inducer probe efavirenz, tenofovir alafenamide exposure was not significantly \naffected. Following administration of tenofovir alafenamide, plasma [14C]-radioactivity showed a \ntime-dependent profile with tenofovir alafenamide as the most abundant species in the initial few \nhours and uric acid in the remaining period.\n\nElimination\n\nDarunavir\nAfter a 400/100 mg [14C]-darunavir with ritonavir dose, approximately 79.5% and 13.9% of the \nadministered dose of [14C]-darunavir could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged \ndarunavir accounted for approximately 41.2% and 7.7% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, \nrespectively.\n\nThe intravenous clearance of darunavir alone (150 mg) and in the presence of low dose (100 mg)\nritonavir was 32.8 l/h and 5.9 l/h, respectively. The median terminal plasma half-life of darunavir \nfollowing administration of Symtuza is 5.5 hours.\n\nCobicistat\nFollowing oral administration of [14C]-cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in feces \nand urine, respectively. The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following administration of \nSymtuza is 3.6 hours.\n\n\n\n29\n\nEmtricitabine\nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%). Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites. The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 mL/min. Following oral administration of Symtuza, the median terminal elimination half-life of \nemtricitabine is 17.2 hours.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide\nTenofovir alafenamide is mainly eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir. The median terminal \nelimination half\u2013life of tenofovir alafenamide was 0.3 hours when administered as Symtuza. \nTenofovir is eliminated from the body by the kidneys by both glomerular filtration and active tubular \nsecretion. Tenofovir has a median plasma half-life of approximately 32 hours. Renal excretion of \nintact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with less than 1% of the dose eliminated in urine. The \npharmacologically active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate, has a half-life of 150-180 hours within \nPBMCs.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of Symtuza have not been investigated in paediatric patients. However, there \nare pharmacokinetic data for the different components of Symtuza, indicating that doses of 800 mg\ndarunavir, 150 mg cobicistat, 200 mg emtricitabine and 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide result in similar \nexposures in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg.\n\nElderly\nLimited PK information is available in the elderly (age \u2265 65 years of age) for Symtuza as well as its \nindividual components.\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that darunavir pharmacokinetics \nare not considerably different in the age range (18 to 75 years) evaluated in HIV infected patients \n(N = 12, age \u2265 65 years) (see section 4.4).\nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to age have been identified for cobicistat, \nemtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide in the age range \u2264 65 years.\n\nGender\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed a slightly higher darunavir exposure (16.8%) in HIV-1\ninfected females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant.\n\nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for cobicistat, \nemtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide.\n\nRenal impairment\nSymtuza has not been investigated in patients with renal impairment. There are pharmacokinetic data \nfor the (individual) components of Symtuza.\n\nDarunavir\nResults from a mass balance study with [14C]-darunavir with ritonavir showed that approximately \n7.7% of the administered dose of darunavir is excreted in the urine unchanged.\n\nAlthough darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly \naffected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFRCG between 30-60 mL/min, \nN = 20) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n30\n\nCobicistat\nA trial of the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with \nsevere renal impairment (eGFRCG below 30 mL/min). No meaningful differences in cobicistat \npharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects, \nconsistent with low renal clearance of cobicistat.\n\nEmtricitabine\nMean systemic emtricitabine exposure was higher in patients with severe renal impairment \n(eGFRCG < 30 mL/min) (33.7 mcg\u2022h/mL) than in subjects with normal renal function \n(11.8 mcg\u2022h/mL).\n\nTenofovir alafenamide\nNo clinically relevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir pharmacokinetics were \nobserved between healthy subjects and patients with severe renal impairment (eGFRCG > 15 but \n< 30 mL/min) in studies of tenofovir alafenamide. There are no pharmacokinetic data on tenofovir \nalafenamide in patients with eGFRCG < 15 mL/min.\n\nHepatic impairment\nSymtuza has not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment. There are pharmacokinetic \ndata for the (individual) components of Symtuza.\n\nDarunavir\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a multiple dose trial with \ndarunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total plasma concentrations \nof darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, N = 8) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, \nN = 8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects. However, unbound \ndarunavir concentrations were approximately 55% (Child-Pugh Class A) and 100% (Child-Pugh \nClass B) higher, respectively. The clinical relevance of this increase is unknown. The effect of severe \nhepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been studied (see sections 4.2, 4.3 \nand 4.4).\n\nCobicistat\nCobicistat is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. A trial of the pharmacokinetics of \ncobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class B). No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed \nbetween subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat has not been studied.\n\nEmtricitabine\nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment; \nhowever, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver \nimpairment should be limited.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide\nClinically relevant changes in tenofovir pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment were \nnot observed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide has not been \nstudied.\n\nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection\nThere were insufficient pharmacokinetic data in the clinical trials to determine the effect of hepatitis B\nand/or C virus infection on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir,cobicistat, emtricitabine, or tenofovir \nalafenamide (refer to sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily during pregnancy results in low darunavir \nexposure (see Table 8). In women receiving darunavir/cobicistat during the second trimester of \n\n\n\n31\n\npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 49%, 56% and \n92% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \ndarunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 37%, 50% and 89% lower, respectively, as compared \nwith postpartum. The unbound fraction was also substantially reduced, including around 90% \nreductions of Cmin levels. The main cause of these low exposures is a marked reduction in cobicistat \nexposure as a consequence of pregnancy-associated enzyme induction (see below).\n\nTable 8\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/cobicistat \n800/150 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy, and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean \u00b1 SD)\n\nSecond trimester \nof pregnancy\n\nN = 7\n\nThird trimester \nof pregnancy\n\nN = 6\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\nN = 6\nCmax, ng/mL 4,340 \u00b1 1,616 4,910 \u00b1 970 7,918 \u00b1 2,199\nAUC24h, ng.h/mL 47,293 \u00b1 19,058 47,991 \u00b1 9,879 99,613 \u00b1 34,862\nCmin, ng/mL 168 \u00b1 149 184 \u00b1 99 1,538 \u00b1 1,344\n\nThe exposure to cobicistat was lower during pregnancy, potentially leading to suboptimal boosting of \ndarunavir. During the second trimester of pregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin were 50%, \n63%, and 83% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum. During the third trimester of \npregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin, were 27%, 49%, and 83% lower, respectively, as \ncompared with postpartum.\n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available for emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide during pregnancy.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nDarunavir\n\nNon-clinical data on darunavir reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. Darunavir has no \neffect on fertility or early embryonic development and DRV shows no teratogenic potential, at \nexposure levels below those at the recommended clinical dose in humans.\n\nIn juvenile rats receiving darunavir up to days 23-26 (equivalent to less than 2 years of age in \nhumans), increased mortality was observed with convulsions in some animals. These findings were \nattributed to the immaturity of the liver enzymes and of the blood brain barrier. Due to uncertainties \nregarding the rate of development of the human blood brain barrier and liver enzymes Symtuza should \nnot be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of age.\n\nCobicistat\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose\ntoxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development. No teratogenic effects were\nobserved in rats and rabbit developmental toxicity studies. In rats, ossification changes in the spinal\ncolumn and sternebrae of fetuses occurred at a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity.\n\nEx vivo rabbit studies and in vivo dog studies suggest that cobicistat has a low potential for QT\nprolongation, and may slightly prolong the PR interval and decrease left ventricular function at mean\nconcentrations at least 10-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 150 mg daily \ndose.\n\nA long term carcinogenicity study of cobicistat in rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for this\nspecies, that is regarded as of no relevance for humans. A long term carcinogenicity study in mice did\nnot show any carcinogenic potential.\n\n\n\n32\n\nEmtricitabine\n\nNon-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction and development.\n\nEmtricitabine had demonstrated low carcinogenic potential in mice and rats.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide\n\nNon-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary \ntarget organs of toxicity. Bone toxicity was observed as reduced bone mineral density in rats and dogs \nat tenofovir exposures at least four times greater than those expected after administration of Symtuza. \nA minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and \ntenofovir exposures of approximately 15 and 40 times greater, respectively, than those expected after \nadministration of Symtuza.\n\nTenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays.\n\nBecause there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after the administration of tenofovir \nalafenamide compared to tenofovir disoproxil, carcinogenicity studies and a rat peri-postnatal study \nwere conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil. No special hazard for humans was revealed in \nconventional studies of carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development. \nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or \nfetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a \nperi-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses.\n\n6.

What Symtuza is and what it is used for\n\nSymtuza is an antiretroviral medicine used to treat infection with human immunodeficiency virus 1\n(HIV-1). It is used in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. \nSymtuza contains four active substances:\n\uf0b7 darunavir, an anti-HIV medicine known as a protease inhibitor\n\uf0b7 cobicistat, a booster (enhancer) of darunavir\n\uf0b7 emtricitabine, an anti-HIV medicine known as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n\uf0b7 tenofovir alafenamide, an anti-HIV medicine known as a nucleotide reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor\n\nSymtuza reduces HIV-1 in your body and this will improve your immune system (your body\u2019s natural \ndefences) and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection but Symtuza is not a cure \nfor HIV infection.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Symtuza\n\nDo not take Symtuza\n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir \n\nalafenamide, or any of the other ingredients of Symtuza (listed in section 6).\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \n\nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary.\n\nDo not combine Symtuza with any of the following medicines\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine.\n\n\n\n44\n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine\nAlfuzosin to treat enlarged prostate\nAmiodarone, dronedarone, ivabradine,\nquinidine, or ranolazine\n\nto treat certain heart disorders (e.g. abnormal \nheart rhythm)\n\nCarbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin to prevent seizures \nColchicine (if you have kidney/liver problems) to treat gout\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir anti-HIV medicine\nRifampicin to treat some infections such as tuberculosis\nPimozide, lurasidone, quetiapine or sertindole to treat psychiatric conditions\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine headaches\n\nSt. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) a herbal product used for depression\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels\nTriazolam or midazolam (taken by mouth) to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety\nSildenafil to treat a heart and lung disorder called \n\npulmonary arterial hypertension.

Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.\n\nPeople taking Symtuza may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.\n\nPeople taking Symtuza may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or potentially \nlife-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Symtuza. Tell your doctor immediately, if any of these apply to you.\n\uf0b7 if you have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B or C infection. Your doctor \n\nmay evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take Symtuza.\n\uf0b7 If you have hepatitis B infection, your liver problems may become worse after you stop taking \n\nSymtuza. It is important not to stop taking Symtuza without talking to your doctor first.\n\uf0b7 if you have had problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will consider if Symtuza is the right \n\nmedicine for you.\n\uf0b7 if you have diabetes. Symtuza might increase sugar levels in the blood.\n\uf0b7 if you notice any symptoms of infection (e.g. swollen lymph nodes and fever). In some patients \n\nwith advanced HIV infection and who had unusual infections due to a weakened immune \nsystem (opportunistic infection), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections \nmay occur soon after you start HIV treatment. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \nimprovement in the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n\uf0b7 if you notice symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and \nmoving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, tell your doctor \n\n\n\n45\n\nimmediately. In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for \nthe treatment of your HIV infection, due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response. \nAutoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have haemophilia. Symtuza might increase the risk of bleeding.\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).\n\uf0b7 if you notice any muscle or bone problems. Some patients taking anti-HIV medicines may \n\ndevelop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (bone damage caused by loss of blood supply to the \nbone). This may be more likely with long-term HIV treatment, more severe damage to the \nimmune system, being overweight, or the use of alcohol or medicines called corticosteroids. \nSigns of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and \nshoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.\n\nElderly\nSymtuza has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this age \ngroup, please discuss with your doctor if you can use Symtuza.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nSymtuza is not for use in children younger than 12 years, or weighing less than 40 kg, as it has \nnot been studied in children under 12 years.\n\nOther medicines and Symtuza\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with Symtuza. These are mentioned above \nunder the heading \u2018Do not combine Symtuza with any of the following medicines:\u2019\n\nSymtuza must not be used with another antiviral medicine that contains a booster or another antiviral \nthat requires boosting. In some cases dosage of other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore, \nalways tell your doctor if you take other anti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor\u2019s instruction \ncarefully on which medicines can be combined.\n\nYou should also not take Symtuza with medicines that contain tenofovir disoproxil (e.g. as fumarate, \nphosphate, or succinate), lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil, or medicines that require boosting with \nritonavir or cobicistat.\n\nThe effects of Symtuza might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your doctor if \nyou take:\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Dexamethasone (injection) (corticosteroid)\n- Boceprevir (to treat hepatitis C virus infection)\n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (to treat bacterial infections)\n- Oxcarbazepine (to prevent seizures).\n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take Symtuza. Tell your doctor if you take:\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, felodipine, flecainide, mexiletine, nicardipine, nifedipine, \n\npropafenone, lidocaine, verapamil (for heart disease) as the therapeutic effect or side effects of \nthese medicines may be increased.\n\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic effect or \n\nside effects may be altered.\n- Clonazepam (to prevent seizures).\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. Symtuza might \n\nreduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, non-hormonal contraception methods are \nrecommended.\n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. Symtuza might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels by \ndrospirenone.\n\n\n\n46\n\n- Budesonide, fluticasone (to control asthma). Its use should only take place after medical\nevaluation and under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.\n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)\n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)\n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)\n- Dasatinib, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (medicines to treat cancer)\n- Prednisone (corticosteroid)\n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder\n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir, boceprevir (to treat hepatitis C virus infection).\n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain).\n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).\n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or Symtuza\u2019s\ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.\nTell your doctor if you take:\n- Alfentanil (injectable, strong and short-acting, painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)\n- Carvedilol, metoprolol, timolol (for heart disease)\n- Warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as its therapeutic effect or side effects may be altered; \n\nyour doctor may have to check your blood.\n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Clotrimazole, fluconazole, Isavuconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, (for treating fungal\n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.\n- Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). \n\nThe risk of muscle damage might be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol \nlowering regimen is best for your specific situation.\n\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)\n- Tadalafil, sildenafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the\n\npulmonary circulation)\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat\n\ndepression and anxiety)\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (psychiatric medicines)\n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased.

Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you are \ntaking.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or if you are \nbreast-feeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take Symtuza.\n\nIt is recommended that women with HIV do not breast-feed their infants because of the possibility of \nthe baby becoming infected with HIV through breast milk and because the medicine may affect the\nbaby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSymtuza can cause dizziness. Do not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking Symtuza.\n\n\n\n47\n\n3. How to take Symtuza\n\nAlways take Symtuza exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or\npharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least \n40 kg is one tablet each day with food.\n\nYou must take Symtuza every day and always with food. You must eat a meal or a snack within \n30 minutes before taking your Symtuza. The type of food is not important.\n\n\uf0b7 The tablet should not be crushed, but swallowed whole. The tablet can be taken with a drink \nsuch as water, milk or any nutritional drink. Take Symtuza at around the same time each day.\n\nRemoving the child resistant cap\n\nThe plastic bottle comes with a child resistant cap and must be opened as follows:\n\uf0b7 Push the plastic screw cap down while turning it counter clockwise.\n\uf0b7 Remove the unscrewed cap.\n\nIf you take more Symtuza than you should\nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can show what you have taken.\n\nIf you forget to take Symtuza\nIt is important not to miss a dose of Symtuza.\n\nIf you do miss a dose:\n\uf0b7 If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take Symtuza, you must take the tablet \n\nimmediately, with food. Then take the next dose at your usual time.\n\uf0b7 If you notice 12 hours or more after the time you usually take Symtuza, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose and take the next doses with food at your usual time. Do not take a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you vomit within 1 hour of taking the medicine, another dose of Symtuza should be taken with food \nas soon as possible. If you vomit more than 1 hour after taking the medicine, then you do not need to \ntake another dose of Symtuza until the next regularly scheduled time.\n\nContact your doctor if you are uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.\n\nDo not stop taking Symtuza without talking to your doctor first\n\nAnti-HIV medicines may make you feel better. Even when you feel better, do not stop taking \nSymtuza. Talk to your doctor first.\n\nWhen your supply of Symtuza starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time. The disease may then become harder to treat.\n\nIf you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is very important not to stop taking Symtuza\nwithout talking to your doctor first. You may require blood tests for several months after stopping \ntreatment with Symtuza. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment \nmay lead to worsening of hepatitis, which may be life-threatening.\nTell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly \nsymptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection.\n\n\n\n48\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nTell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects.\nLiver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor should do blood tests \nbefore you start Symtuza. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check \nyour blood tests more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver problems. Talk \nto your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver problems. These may include yellowing of your \nskin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale-coloured stools (bowel movements), \nnausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below \nyour ribs.\n\nSkin rash may affect more than 1 in 10 patients receiving Symtuza. Although most rashes are mild and \ndisappear after a while as treatment is continued, a rash can occasionally be severe or potentially \nlife-threatening. It is important to talk to your doctor if you develop a rash. Your doctor will advise \nyou how to deal with your symptoms or whether Symtuza must be stopped.\n\nOther severe side effects, seen up to 1 patient in 10, were diabetes, increased blood fat levels and \nsymptoms of infection. Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) has been reported in up to 1 patient \nin 100.\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n\uf0b7 headache\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 rash\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n\uf0b7 low red blood cell count (anaemia)\n\uf0b7 allergic reactions such as nettle rash (urticaria), itching, decreased appetite (anorexia)\n\uf0b7 abnormal dreams\n\uf0b7 vomiting, pain or swelling of the belly, indigestion, flatulence (wind)\n\uf0b7 abnormal blood test results such as some tests for your kidney. Your doctor will explain these to \n\nyou.\n\uf0b7 dizziness\n\uf0b7 joint pain\n\uf0b7 muscle pain, muscle cramps or weakness\n\uf0b7 weakness\n\uf0b7 tiredness (fatigue)\n\uf0b7 feeling sick (nausea)\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n\uf0b7 severe swelling of the skin and other tissues (most often the lips or the eyes)\n\uf0b7 symptoms of infection or of autoimmune disorders (immune reconstitution inflammatory \n\nsyndrome)\n\uf0b7 enlargement of breasts\n\uf0b7 osteonecrosis (bone damage caused by loss of blood supply to the bone)\n\uf0b7 abnormal blood test results such as some tests for your pancreas. Your doctor will explain these \n\nto you.\n\n\n\n49\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\n\uf0b7 a reaction called DRESS [severe rash, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, swelling of \n\nthe face or lymph glands, increase of eosinophils (type of white blood cells), effects on liver, \nkidney or lung].\n\nSome side effects are typical for anti-HIV medicines similar to Symtuza. These are:\n- raised blood sugar and worsening of diabetes\n- muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. On rare occasions, these muscle disorders have been \n\nserious.\n- immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection (unusual infections due to a weakened immune \nsystem), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after \nHIV treatment is started, including Symtuza. In addition to the opportunistic infections, \nautoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body \ntissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. \nAutoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment.\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5.

medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. tell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects. liver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. your doctor should do blood tests before you start symtuza. if you have chronic hepatitis b or c infection, your doctor should check your blood tests more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver problems. talk to your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver problems. these may include yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale-coloured stools (bowel movements), nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below your ribs. skin rash may affect more than 1 in 10 patients receiving symtuza. although most rashes are mild and disappear after a while as treatment is continued, a rash can occasionally be severe or potentially life-threatening. it is important to talk to your doctor if you develop a rash. your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms or whether symtuza must be stopped. other severe side effects, seen up to 1 patient in 10, were diabetes, increased blood fat levels and symptoms of infection. inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) has been reported in up to 1 patient in 100. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) headache diarrhoea rash common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) low red blood cell count (anaemia) allergic reactions such as nettle rash (urticaria), itching, decreased appetite (anorexia) abnormal dreams vomiting, pain or swelling of the belly, indigestion, flatulence (wind) abnormal blood test results such as some tests for your kidney. your doctor will explain these to you. dizziness joint pain muscle pain, muscle cramps or weakness weakness tiredness (fatigue) feeling sick (nausea) uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) severe swelling of the skin and other tissues (most often the lips or the eyes) symptoms of infection or of autoimmune disorders (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) enlargement of breasts osteonecrosis (bone damage caused by loss of blood supply to the bone) abnormal blood test results such as some tests for your pancreas. your doctor will explain these to you. rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) a reaction called dress [severe rash, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, swelling of the face or lymph glands, increase of eosinophils (type of white blood cells), effects on liver, kidney or lung]. some side effects are typical for anti-hiv medicines similar to symtuza. these are: - raised blood sugar and worsening of diabetes - muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. on rare occasions, these muscle disorders have been serious. - immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infection (unusual infections due to a weakened immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after hiv treatment is started, including symtuza. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. during hiv therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition":
