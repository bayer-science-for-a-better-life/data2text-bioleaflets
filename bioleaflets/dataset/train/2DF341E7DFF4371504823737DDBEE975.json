NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nGrastofil 30 MU/0.5 mL solution for injection/infusion in pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach mL of solution contains 60 million units (MU) (equivalent to 600 micrograms [\u03bcg]) of filgrastim.  \n\n \n\nEach syringe of 0.5 mL solution contains 30 MU (300 micrograms) of filgrastim  \n\n(600 micrograms/mL). \n\n \n\nFilgrastim is a recombinant methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor produced in \n\nEscherichia coli (BL21) by recombinant DNA technology. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect  \n\n \n\nEach mL of solution contains 50 mg of sorbitol (E420) (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection/infusion.  \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n4. CLINCAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nGrastofil is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile \n\nneutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the \n\nexception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the \n\nduration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow \n\ntransplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.  \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Grastofil are similar in adults, children and adolescents receiving cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy.  \n\n   \n\nGrastofil is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). \n\n \n\nIn patients, children or adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute \n\nneutrophil count (ANC) of \u2264 0.5 x 10\n9\n/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term \n\nadministration of Grastofil is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and \n\nduration of infection-related events. \n\n \n\nGrastofil is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to \n\n1.0 x 10\n9\n/L) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections \n\nwhen other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nGrastofil therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience \n\nin granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment and haematology and has the necessary \n\ndiagnostic facilities. The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nwith an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the \n\nmonitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed.  \n\n \n\nEstablished cytotoxic chemotherapy  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Grastofil is 0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day). The first dose of \n\nGrastofil should be administered at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. In randomised \n\nclinical studies, a subcutaneous dose of 230 micrograms/m\n2\n/day (4.0 to 8.4 micrograms/kg/day) was \n\nused.  \n\n   \n\nDaily dosing with Grastofil should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the \n\nneutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Following established chemotherapy for solid \n\ntumours, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukaemias, it is expected that the duration of treatment required \n\nto fulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days. Following induction and consolidation treatment for acute \n\nmyeloid leukaemia the duration of treatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 days) depending on \n\nthe type, dose and schedule of cytotoxic chemotherapy used.  \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen \n\n1-2 days after initiation of Grastofil therapy. However, for a sustained therapeutic response, Grastofil \n\ntherapy should not be discontinued before the expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil count has \n\nrecovered to the normal range. Premature discontinuation of Grastofil therapy, prior to the time of the \n\nexpected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nGrastofil may be given as a daily subcutaneous injection or as a daily intravenous infusion diluted in \n\n5% glucose solution given over 30 minutes (see section 6.6). The subcutaneous route is preferred in \n\nmost cases. There is some evidence from a study of single dose administration that intravenous dosing \n\nmay shorten the duration of effect. The clinical relevance of this finding to multiple dose \n\nadministration is not clear. The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical circumstance.  \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Grastofil is 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 micrograms/kg/day). The first dose \n\nof Grastofil should be administered at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 \n\nhours after bone marrow infusion.  \n\n \n\nOnce the neutrophil nadir has been passed, the daily dose of Grastofil should be titrated against the \n\nneutrophil response as follows: \n\n \n\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) Grastofil dose adjustment  \n\nANC > 1.0 x 10\n9\n/L for 3 consecutive days  Reduce to 0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day)  \n\nThen, if ANC remains > 1.0 x 10\n9\n/L for 3 more \n\nconsecutive days  \n\nDiscontinue Grastofil  \n\nIf the ANC decreases to < 1.0 x 10\n9\n/L during the treatment period, the dose of Grastofil should be re-\n\nescalated according to the above steps  \n\nANC = absolute neutrophil count  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nGrastofil may be given as a 30 minute or 24 hour intravenous infusion or given by continuous 24 hour \n\nsubcutaneous infusion. Grastofil should be diluted in 20 mL of 5% glucose solution  (see section 6.6).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nFor the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in patients undergoing \n\nmyelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Grastofil for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 \n\nmicrograms/kg/day) for 5-7 consecutive days. The timing of leukapheresis: one or two leukaphereses \n\non days 5 and 6 which is often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses may be \n\nnecessary. Grastofil dosing should be maintained until the last leukapheresis.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Grastofil for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is \n\n0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day) from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the \n\nexpected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. \n\nLeukapheresis should be performed during the period when the ANC rises from < 0.5 x 10\n9\n/L to  \n\n> 5.0 x 10\n9\n/L. For patients who have not had extensive chemotherapy, one leukapheresis is often \n\nsufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses are recommended.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nGrastofil for PBPC mobilisation when used alone Grastofil may be given as a 24 hour subcutaneous \n\ncontinuous infusion or subcutaneous injection. For infusions Grastofil should be diluted in 20 mL of \n\n5% glucose solution (see section 6.6).  \n\n \n\nGrastofil for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy \n\nGrastofil should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nFor the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nFor PBPC mobilisation in normal donors, Grastofil should be administered at 1.0 MU/kg/day \n\n(10 micrograms/kg/day) for 4 - 5 consecutive days. Leukapheresis should be started at day 5 and \n\ncontinued until day 6 if needed in order to collect 4 x 10\n6\n\n \n\nCD34\n+\n cells/kg recipient bodyweight.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nGrastofil should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nIn patients with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN)  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nCongenital neutropenia: the recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU/kg/day (12 micrograms/kg/day) as \n\na single dose or in divided doses.  \n\n \n\nIdiopathic or cyclic neutropenia:  the recommended starting dose is 0.5 MU/kg/day  \n\n(5 micrograms/kg/day) as a single dose or in divided doses.  \n\n \n\nDose adjustment: Grastofil should be administered daily by subcutaneous injection until the neutrophil \n\ncount has reached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 10\n9\n/L. When the response has been \n\nobtained, the minimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established. Long-term daily \n\nadministration is required to maintain an adequate neutrophil count. After one to two weeks of \n\ntherapy, the initial dose may be doubled or halved depending upon the patient's response. \n\nSubsequently, the dose may be individually adjusted every 1-2 weeks to maintain the average \n\nneutrophil count between 1.5 x 10\n9\n/L and 10 x 10\n\n9\n/L. A faster schedule of dose escalation may be \n\nconsidered in patients presenting with severe infections. In clinical studies, 97% of patients who \n\nresponded had a complete response at doses of \u2264 2.4 MU/kg/day (24 micrograms/kg/day). The  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nlong-term safety of administration of Grastofil at doses above 2.4 MU/kg/day (24 micrograms/kg/day) \n\nin patients with SCN has not been established.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nCongenital, idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia: Grastofil should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nIn patients with HIV infection  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\nFor reversal of neutropenia  \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Grastofil is 0.1 MU/kg/day (1 micrograms/kg/day)  with titration \n\nup to a maximum of 0.4 MU/kg/day (4 micrograms/kg/day) until a normal neutrophil count is reached \n\nand can be maintained (ANC > 2.0 x 10\n9\n/L). In clinical studies, > 90% of patients responded at these \n\ndoses, achieving a reversal of neutropenia in a median of 2 days.  \n\n \n\nIn a small number of patients (< 10%), doses up to 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 micrograms/kg/day) were \n\nrequired to achieve reversal of neutropenia. \n\n \n\nFor maintenance of normal neutrophil counts  \n\nWhen reversal of neutropenia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose to maintain a normal \n\nneutrophil count should be established. Initial dose adjustment to alternate day dosing with 30 MU/day \n\n(300 micrograms/day) is recommended. Further dose adjustment may be necessary, as determined by \n\nthe patient's ANC, to maintain the neutrophil count at > 2.0 x 10\n9\n/L. In clinical studies, dosing with 30 \n\nMU/day (300 micrograms/day) on 1 - 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC \n\n > 2.0 x 10\n9\n/L, with the median dose frequency being 3 days per week. Long-term administration may \n\nbe required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 10\n9\n/L.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nReversal of neutropenia or maintaining normal neutrophil counts: Grastofil should be given by \n\nsubcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nElderly patients  \n\nClinical studies with filgrastim have included a small number of elderly patients but special studies \n\nhave not been performed in this group and therefore specific posology recommendations cannot be \n\nmade. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal/hepatic impairment  \n\nStudies of filgrastim in patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function demonstrate that it \n\nexhibits a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals. \n\nDose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients in the SCN and cancer settings  \n\nSixty-five percent of patients studied in a SCN trial program, were under 18 years of age. The efficacy \n\nof treatment was clear for this age group, which included most patients with congenital neutropenia. \n\nThere were no differences in the safety profiles for paediatric patients treated for SCN. \n\n \n\nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \n\nsimilar in both adults, children and adolescents receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nThe dose recommendations in paediatric patients are the same as those in adults receiving \n\nmyelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability  \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.   \n\n \n\nSpecial warnings and precautions across indications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \n\nbeen reported in patients treated with filgrastim. Permanently discontinue filgrastim in patients with \n\nclinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer filgrastim to patients with a history of \n\nhypersensitivity to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.  \n\n \n\nPulmonary adverse reactions \n\nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial lung disease, have been reported after G-CSF \n\nadministration. Patients with a recent history of lung infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. \n\nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs \n\nof pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of Acute \n\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Filgrastim should be discontinued and appropriate treatment \n\ngiven. \n\n \n\nGlomerulonephritis \n\nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \n\nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \n\npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome  \n\nCapillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported after \n\ngranulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration, and is characterised by hypotension, \n\nhypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak \n\nsyndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may \n\ninclude a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSplenomegaly and Splenic rupture \n\nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture have been reported in \n\npatients and normal donors following administration of filgrastim. Some cases of splenic rupture were \n\nfatal. Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A \n\ndiagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in donors and/or patients reporting left upper \n\nabdominal or shoulder tip pain. Dose reductions of filgrastim have been noted to slow or stop the \n\nprogression of splenic enlargement in patients with severe chronic neutropenia, and in 3% of patients a \n\nsplenectomy was required. \n\n \n\nMalignant cell growth \n\nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects \n\nmay be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n\n \n\nMyelodysplastic syndrome or Chronic myeloid leukemia \n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or \n\nchronic myelogenous leukaemia have not been established. Filgrastim is not indicated for use in these \n\nconditions. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast transformation of \n\nchronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia \n\nIn view of limited safety and efficacy data in patients with secondary AML, filgrastim should be \n\nadministered with caution. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in de novo AML \n\npatients aged < 55 years with good cytogenetics [t(8; 21), t(15; 17), and inv(16)] have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nThrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim. Platelet counts should be \n\nmonitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Consideration should be \n\ngiven to temporary discontinuation or dose reduction of filgrastim in patients with severe chronic \n\nneutropenia who develop thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 x 10\n9\n/l). \n\n \n\nLeukocytosis \n\nWhite blood cell counts of 100 x 10\n9\n/L or greater have been observed in less than 5% of cancer \n\npatients receiving filgrastim at doses above 0.3 MU/kg/day (3 \u00b5g/kg/day). No undesirable effects \n\ndirectly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis have been reported. However, in view of the \n\npotential risks associated with severe leukocytosis, a white blood cell count should be performed at \n\nregular intervals during filgrastim therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 10\n9\n/L after the expected \n\nnadir, filgrastim should be discontinued immediately. When administered for PBPC mobilisation, \n\nfilgrastim should be discontinued or its dosage should be reduced if the leukocyte counts rise to  \n\n> 70 x 10\n9\n/L. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \n\nantibodies against filgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \n\nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present. \n\n \n\nAortitis \n\nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \n\nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \n\nmarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \n\nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8.  \n\n \n\nSpecial warning and precautions associated with co-morbidities \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease \n\nSickle cell crises, in some cases fatal, have been reported with the use of filgrastim in patients with \n\nsickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Physicians should use caution when prescribing filgrastim in \n\npatients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. \n\n \n\nOsteoporosis \n\nMonitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases \n\nwho undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in cancer patients \n\n \n\nFilgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established \n\ndosage regimens. \n\n \n\nRisks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy \n\nSpecial caution should be used when treating patients with high dose chemotherapy because improved \n\ntumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic medicinal \n\nproducts may lead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic and dermatologic \n\neffects (please refer to the prescribing information of the specific chemotherapy medicinal products \n\nused). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nEffect of chemotherapy on erythrocytes and thrombocytes \n\nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \n\nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy. Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy \n\n(e.g. full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and \n\nanaemia. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should \n\nbe taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic medicinal products which are \n\nknown to cause severe thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nThe use of filgrastim-mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of \n\nthrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nOther special precautions \n\nThe effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been \n\nstudied. Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil \n\ncounts. Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors, neutrophil response may be diminished (such \n\nas those treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration \n\nby tumour). \n\n \n\nVascular disorders, including veno-occlusive disease and fluid volume disturbances, have been \n\nreported occasionally in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation. \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF \n\nafter allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \n\nassociated with transient abnormal bone scans. This should be considered when interpreting bone-\n\nimaging results. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in patients undergoing PBPC mobilisation \n\n \n\nMobilisation  \n\nThere are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods \n\n(filgrastim alone, or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient \n\npopulation. The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of \n\nCD34\n+\n cells mean that direct comparison between different studies is difficult. It is therefore difficult \n\nto recommend an optimal method. The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in relation \n\nto the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient.  \n\n \n\nPrior exposure to cytotoxic medicinal products  \n\nPatients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy may not show sufficient \n\nmobilisation of PBPC to achieve the recommended minimum yield (2.0 x 10\n6\n CD34\n\n+\n cells/kg) or \n\nacceleration of platelet recovery to the same degree. \n\n \n\nSome cytotoxic medicinal products  exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool \n\nand may adversely affect progenitor mobilisation. Medicinal products such as melphalan, carmustine \n\n(BCNU) and carboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor \n\nmobilisation, may reduce progenitor yield. However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or \n\ncarmustine (BCNU) together with filgrastim has been shown to be effective for progenitor \n\nmobilisation. When peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation is envisaged it is advisable to plan \n\nthe stem cell mobilisation procedure early in the treatment course of the patient. Particular attention \n\nshould be paid to the number of progenitors mobilised in such patients before the administration of \n\nhigh-dose chemotherapy. If yields are inadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms \n\nof treatment not requiring progenitor support should be considered. \n\n \n\nAssessment of progenitor cell yields \n\nIn assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular \n\nattention should be paid to the method of quantitation. The results of flow cytometric analysis of \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nCD34\n+ \n\ncell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and therefore, recommendations \n\nof numbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution. \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34\n+\n cells re-infused and the rate of \n\nplatelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship. \n\n \n\nThe recommendation of a minimum yield of \u2265 2.0 x 10\n6 \n\nCD34\n+\n cells/kg is based on published \n\nexperience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution. Yields in excess of this minimum yield \n\nappear to correlate with more rapid recovery; those below with slower recovery. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in normal donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilisation \n\n \n\nMobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be \n\nconsidered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\nPBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory \n\neligibility criteria for stem cell donation with special attention to haematological values and infectious \n\ndiseases.  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim has not been assessed in normal donors less than 16 years or \n\ngreater than 60 years of age.  \n\n \n\nTransient thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 10\n9\n/L) following filgrastim administration and \n\nleukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied. Among these, two cases of platelets  \n\n< 50 x 10\n9/L  were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure.  \n\n \n\nIf more than one leukapheresis is required, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets \n\n< 100 x 10\n9\n/L prior to leukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets are  \n\n< 75 x 10\n9\n/L.  \n\n \n\nLeukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects \n\nin haemostasis.  \n\n \n\nDonors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be monitored until haematological indices \n\nreturn to normal.  \n\n \n\nTransient cytogenetic abnormalities have been observed in normal donors following G-CSF use. The \n\nsignificance of these changes is unknown. Nevertheless, a risk of promotion of a malignant myeloid \n\nclone cannot be excluded. It is recommended that the apheresis centre perform a systematic record and \n\ntracking of the stem cell donors for at least 10 years to ensure monitoring of long-term safety. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in recipients of allogeneic PBPC mobilised with filgrastim \n\nCurrent data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the \n\nrecipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with \n\nbone marrow transplantation. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in SCN patients \n\n \n\nFilgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia who develop \n\nleukaemia or have evidence of leukaemic evolution. \n\n \n\nBlood cell counts \n\nOther blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, \n\nwhich require close monitoring of cell counts. \n\n \n\nTransformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome \n\nSpecial care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\ndisorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia and myeloid leukaemia. Complete blood cell \n\ncounts with differential and platelet counts and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and \n\nkaryotype should be performed prior to treatment. \n\n \n\nThere was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in \n\nclinical trial patients with SCN treated with filgrastim. This observation has only been made in \n\npatients with congenital neutropenia. MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease \n\nand are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy. A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had \n\nnormal cytogenetic evaluations at baseline was subsequently found to have abnormalities, including \n\nmonosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation. It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of \n\npatients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic \n\ntransformation. It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow \n\nexaminations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months). \n\n \n\nOther special precautions \n\nCauses of transient neutropenia such as viral infections should be excluded. \n\nHaematuria was common and proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients. Regular urinalysis \n\nshould be performed to monitor this event. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in patients with HIV infection  \n\n \n\nBlood cell counts \n\nANC should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Some \n\npatients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in neutrophil count to the initial \n\ndose of filgrastim. It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for the first 2 to 3 days of \n\nfilgrastim administration. Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is measured at least twice \n\nweekly for the first two weeks and subsequently once per week or once every other week during \n\nmaintenance therapy. During intermittent dosing with 30 MU (300 microgram)/day of filgrastim, there \n\ncan be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time. In order to determine a patient's trough or \n\nnadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement immediately prior \n\nto any scheduled dosing with filgrastim. \n\n \n\nRisk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medications \n\nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \n\nmyelosuppressive medicinal products. As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater \n\nnumber of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of \n\ndeveloping thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see \n\nabove). \n\n \n\nInfections and malignancies causing myelosuppression \n\nNeutropenia may be due to bone marrow infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium \n\navium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma. In patients with known bone marrow-infiltrating \n\ninfections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition in \n\naddition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia. The effects of filgrastim on \n\nneutropenia due to bone marrow-infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established. \n \n\nAll patients \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 50 mg sorbitol. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) \n\nmust not be given this medicinal product unless strictly necessary.  \n\n  \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \n\nmay cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy have not been definitively established. In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing \n\nmyeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended \n\nin the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence from a small \n\nnumber of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5-Fluorouracil indicates that the severity \n\nof neutropenia may be exacerbated. \n\n \n\nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been \n\ninvestigated in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nSince lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, it is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim. \n\nAlthough this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an \n\ninteraction is harmful. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity. An increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed \n\nin rabbits at high multiples of the clinical exposure and in the presence of maternal toxicity (see \n\nsection 5.3).. There are reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in \npregnant women has been demonstrated.  \n\n \n\nFilgrastim is not recommended during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether filgrastim / metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \n\nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue  \n\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from filgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of \n\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nFilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3). \n\nThe impact of filgrastim on human fertility is not known. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nFilgrastim has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur \n\nfollowing the administration of filgrastim (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\n \n\nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during filgrastim treatment include: anaphylactic \n\nreaction, serious pulmonary adverse events (including interstitial pneumonia and ARDS), capillary \n\nleak syndrome, severe splenomegaly/splenic rupture, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome or \n\nleukaemia in SCN patients, GvHD in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transfer or peripheral \n\nblood cell progenitor cell transplant and sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain (which includes \n\nbone pain, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal \n\nchest pain, neck pain), anaemia, vomiting, and nausea. In clinical studies in cancer patients \n\nmusculoskeletal pain was mild or moderate in 10%, and severe in 3% of patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe data in the tables below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical studies and spontaneous \n\nreporting.

Overall, reports were more common after intravenous administration. In \n\nsome cases, symptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. Filgrastim \n\nshould be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.  \n\n \n\nPulmonary adverse reactions \n\nIn clinical studies and the post-marketing setting pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial \n\nlung disease, pulmonary oedema, and lung infiltration have been reported in some cases with an \n\noutcome of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \n\nCases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported following administration of filgrastim. \n\nSome cases of splenic rupture were fatal (see section 4.4).   \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome \n\nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use. \n\nThese have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, using multiple \n\nchemotherapy medicinal products or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCutaneous vasculitis \n\nCutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim. The mechanism of vasculitis \n\nin patients receiving filgrastim is unknown. During long-term use cutaneous vasculitis has been \n\nreported in 2% of SCN patients. \n\n \n\nLeukocytosis \n\nLeukocytosis (WBC > 50 x 10\n9\n/L) was observed in 41% of normal donors and transient \n\nthrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 10\n9\n/L) following filgrastim treatment and leukapheresis was \n\nobserved in 35% of donors (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSweets syndrome \n\nCases of Sweets syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with filgrastim. \n\n \n\nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) \n\nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) has been reported in cancer patients treated with \n\nfilgrastim. \n\n \n\nGvHD \n\nThere have been reports of GvHD and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF after allogeneic bone \n\nmarrow transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \n\nsimilar in both adults, children and adolescents receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy suggesting no   age-\n\nrelated differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. The only consistently reported adverse event \n\nwas musculoskeletal pain which is no different from the experience in the adult population. \n\n \n\nThere is insufficient data to further evaluate filgrastim use in paediatric subjects.  \n\nOther special populations  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects over 65 years of age \n\ncompared to younger adult (>18 years of age) subjects receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and clinical \n\nexperience has not identified differences in the responses between elderly and younger adult patients. \n\nThere is insufficient data to evaluate filgrastim use in elderly subjects for other approved Grastofil \n\nindications.  \n\n  \n\nPaediatric SCN patients \n\nCases of decreased bone density and osteoporosis have been reported in paediatric patients with severe \n\nchronic neutropenia receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThe effects of Grastofil overdose have not been established. Discontinuation of filgrastim therapy \n\nusually results in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days, with a return to normal \n\nlevels in 1 to 7 days. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors, ATC code: L03AA02 \n\n \n\nGrastofil is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nHuman G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils \n\nfrom the bone marrow. Grastofil containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in \n\nperipheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some SCN \n\npatients, filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and \n\nbasophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia \n\nalready prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses. \n\nNeutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by \n\ntests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating \n\nneutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to significant reductions in the \n\nincidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Treatment with filgrastim \n\nsignificantly reduces the duration of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospitalisation after \n\ninduction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myeloablative therapy followed by bone \n\nmarrow transplantation. The incidence of fever and documented infections were not reduced in either \n\nsetting. The duration of fever was not reduced in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed \n\nby bone marrow transplantation.  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim, either alone, or after chemotherapy, mobilises haematopoietic progenitor cells into \n\nperipheral blood. These autologous PBPCs may be harvested and infused after high-dose cytotoxic \n\ntherapy, either in place of, or in addition to bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of PBPCs \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\naccelerates haematopoietic recovery reducing the duration of risk for haemorrhagic complications and \n\nthe need for platelet transfusions.  \n\n \n\nRecipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim experienced significantly more rapid \n\nhaematological recovery, leading to a significant decrease in time to unsupported platelet recovery \n\nwhen compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. \n\n \n\nOne retrospective European study evaluating the use of G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow \n\ntransplantation in patients with acute leukaemias suggested an increase in the risk of GvHD, treatment \n\nrelated mortality (TRM) and mortality when G-CSF was administered. In a separate retrospective \n\ninternational study in patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, no effect on the risk of \n\nGvHD, TRM and mortality was seen. A meta-analysis of allogeneic transplant studies, including the \n\nresults of nine prospective randomised  studies, 8 retrospective studies and 1 case-controlled study, did \n\nnot detect an effect on the risks of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD or early treatment-related mortality.  \n\n \n\nRelative risk (95% CI) of GvHD and TRM following treatment with G-CSF after bone \n\nmarrow (BM) transplantation \n\nPublication  Period of \n\nstudy \n\nN Acute grade          \n\nII - IV GvHD \n\nChronic \n\nGvHD \n\nTRM \n\nMeta-Analysis   \n\n(2003)  \n\n1986 - 2001\na\n 1198  1.08 \n\n(0.87, 1.33)  \n\n1.02 \n\n(0.82, 1.26)  \n\n0.70 \n\n(0.38, 1.31)  \n\nEuropean \n\nRetrospective  \n\nStudy (2004)  \n\n1992 \u2013 2002\nb\n 1789  1.33 \n\n    (1.08, 1.64)  \n\n1.29 \n\n(1.02, 1.61)  \n\n1.73 \n\n(1.30, 2.32)  \n\nInternational \n\nRetrospective  \n\nStudy (2006)  \n\n1995 \u2013 2000\nb\n 2110  1.11 \n\n  (0.86, 1.42)  \n\n1.10 \n\n(0.86, 1.39)  \n\n1.26 \n\n(0.95, 1.67)  \n\na\n \n\nAnalysis includes studies involving BM transplant during this period; some studies used GM-CSF  \nb\n\n \n\nAnalysis includes patients receiving BM transplant during this period  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim for the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC \n\ntransplantation  \n\n \n\nIn normal donors, a 10 micrograms/kg/day dose administered subcutaneously for 4 - 5 consecutive \n\ndays allows a collection of \u2265 4 x 10\n6 \n\n \n\nCD34\n+\n cells/kg recipient body weight in the majority of the \n\ndonors after two leukaphereses.  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim in patients, children or adults, with SCN (severe congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic \n\nneutropenia) induces a sustained increase in ANCs in peripheral blood and a reduction of infection and \n\nrelated events.  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim in patients with HIV infection maintains normal neutrophil counts to allow scheduled \n\ndosing of antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive treatments. There is no evidence that patients with \n\nHIV infection treated with filgrastim show an increase in HIV replication. \n\n \n\nAs with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on \n\nhuman endothelial cells. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of recommended doses, serum concentrations were maintained \n\nabove 10 ng/mL for 8 - 16 hours.  \n\nDistribution  \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution in blood is approximately 150 mL/kg.  \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nElimination  \n\n \n\nClearance of filgrastim has been shown to follow first-order pharmacokinetics after both subcutaneous \n\nand intravenous administration. The serum elimination half-life of filgrastim is approximately 3.5 \n\nhours, with a clearance rate of approximately 0.6 mL/min/kg. Continuous infusion with filgrastim over \n\na period of up to 28 days, in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation, \n\nresulted in no evidence of drug accumulation and comparable half-lives.  \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\n \n\nThere is a positive linear correlation between the dose and the serum concentration of filgrastim, \n\nwhether administered intravenously or subcutaneously.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nFilgrastim was studied in repeated dose toxicity studies up to 1 year in duration which revealed \n\nchanges attributable to the expected pharmacological actions including increases in leukocytes, \n\nmyeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, extramedullary granulopoiesis and splenic enlargement. These \n\nchanges all reversed after discontinuation of treatment. \n\n \n\nEffects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. Intravenous (80 \n\n\u03bcg/kg/day) administration of filgrastim to rabbits during the period of organogenesis was maternally \n\ntoxic and increased spontaneous abortion, post-implantation loss, and decreased mean live litter size \n\nand fetal weight were observed. \n\n \n\nBased on reported data for another filgrastim product similar to Grastofil, comparable findings plus \n\nincreased fetal malformations were observed at 100 \u03bcg/kg/day, a maternally toxic dose which \n\ncorresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately 50-90 times the exposures observed in patients \n\ntreated with the clinical dose of 5 \u03bcg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect level for embryo-fetal \n\ntoxicity in this study was 10 \u03bcg/kg/day, which corresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately \n\n3-5 times the exposures observed in patients treated with the clinical dose. \n\n \n\nIn pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal toxicity was observed at doses up to 575 \u03bcg/kg/day. Offspring of \n\nrats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods, exhibited a delay in external \n\ndifferentiation and growth retardation (\u226520 \u03bcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate  \n\n(100 \u03bcg/kg/day).  \n\n \n\nFilgrastim had no observed effect on the fertility of male or female rats. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nGrastofil 48 MU/0.5 mL solution for injection/infusion in pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach mL of solution contains 96 million units (MU) (equivalent to 960 micrograms [\u03bcg]) of filgrastim.  \n\n \n\nEach syringe of 0.5 mL solution contains 48 MU (480 micrograms) of filgrastim  \n\n(960 micrograms/mL). \n\n \n\nFilgrastim is a recombinant methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor produced in \n\nEscherichia coli (BL21) by recombinant DNA technology. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect  \n\n \n\nEach mL of solution contains 50 mg of sorbitol (E420) (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection/infusion. \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINCAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nGrastofil is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile \n\nneutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the \n\nexception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the \n\nduration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow \n\ntransplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.  \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Grastofil are similar in adults, children and adolescents  receiving cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy.  \n\n   \n\nGrastofil is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). \n\n \n\nIn patients, children or adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute \n\nneutrophil count (ANC) of \u2264 0.5 x 10\n9\n/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term \n\nadministration of Grastofil is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and \n\nduration of infection-related events. \n\n \n\nGrastofil is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to  \n\n1.0 x 10\n9\n/L) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections \n\nwhen other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nGrastofil therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience \n\nin granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment and haematology and has the necessary \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\ndiagnostic facilities. The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration \n\nwith an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the \n\nmonitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed.  \n\n \n\nEstablished cytotoxic chemotherapy  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Grastofil is 0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day). The first dose of \n\nGrastofil should be administered at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.  In randomised \n\nclinical studies, a subcutaneous dose of 230 micrograms/m\n2\n/day (4.0 to 8.4 micrograms/kg/day) was \n\nused.  \n\n \n\nDaily dosing with Grastofil should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the \n\nneutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Following established chemotherapy for solid \n\ntumours, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukaemias, it is expected that the duration of treatment required \n\nto fulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days. Following induction and consolidation treatment for acute \n\nmyeloid leukaemia the duration of treatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 days) depending on \n\nthe type, dose and schedule of cytotoxic chemotherapy used.  \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen \n\n1-2 days after initiation of Grastofil therapy. However, for a sustained therapeutic response, Grastofil \n\ntherapy should not be discontinued before the expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil count has \n\nrecovered to the normal range. Premature discontinuation of Grastofil therapy, prior to the time of the \n\nexpected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended.  \n\n \n\nMethod of Administration  \n\n \n\nGrastofil may be administered as a daily subcutaneous injection or as a daily intravenous infusion \n\ndiluted in 5% glucose solution given over 30 minutes (see section 6.6). The subcutaneous route is \n\npreferred in most cases. There is some evidence from a study of single dose administration that \n\nintravenous dosing may shorten the duration of effect. The clinical relevance of this finding to \n\nmultiple dose administration is not clear. The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical \n\ncircumstance.  \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Grastofil is 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 micrograms/kg/day). The first dose \n\nof Grastofil should be administered at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 \n\nhours after bone marrow infusion.  \n\n \n\nOnce the neutrophil nadir has been passed, the daily dose of Grastofil should be titrated against the \n\nneutrophil response as follows: \n\n \n\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) Grastofil dose adjustment  \n\nANC > 1.0 x 10\n9\n/L for 3 consecutive days  Reduce to 0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day)  \n\nThen, if ANC remains > 1.0 x 10\n9\n/L for 3 more \n\nconsecutive days  \n\nDiscontinue Grastofil  \n\nIf the ANC decreases to < 1.0 x 10\n9\n/L during the treatment period, the dose of Grastofil should be re-\n\nescalated according to the above steps  \n\nANC = absolute neutrophil count  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nMethod of Administration  \n\n \n\nGrastofil may be given as a 30 minute or 24 hour intravenous infusion or given by continuous 24 hour \n\nsubcutaneous infusion. Grastofil should be diluted in 20 mL of 5% glucose solution  (see section 6.6).  \n\n \n\nFor the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in patients undergoing \n\nmyelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Grastofil for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1.0 MU/kg/day \n\n(10 micrograms/kg/day) for 5-7 consecutive days. The timing of leukapheresis: one or two \n\nleukaphereses on days 5 and 6 which is often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional \n\nleukaphereses may be necessary. Grastofil dosing should be maintained until the last leukapheresis.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Grastofil for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is \n\n0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day) from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the \n\nexpected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. \n\nLeukapheresis should be performed during the period when the ANC rises from < 0.5 x 10\n9\n/L to  \n\n> 5.0 x 10\n9\n/L. For patients who have not had extensive chemotherapy, one leukapheresis is often \n\nsufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses are recommended.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nGrastofil for PBPC mobilisation when used alone \n\n \n\nGrastofil may be given as a 24 hour subcutaneous continuous infusion or subcutaneous injection. For \n\ninfusions Grastofil should be diluted in 20 mL of 5% glucose solution (see section 6.6).  \n\n \n\nGrastofil for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy \n\n \n\nGrastofil should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nFor the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nFor PBPC mobilisation in normal donors, Grastofil should be administered at 1.0 MU/kg/day \n\n(10 micrograms/kg/day) for 4 - 5 consecutive days. Leukapheresis should be started at day 5 and \n\ncontinued until day 6 if needed in order to collect 4 x 10\n6\n\n \n\nCD34\n+\n cells/kg recipient bodyweight.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nGrastofil should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nIn patients with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN)  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nCongenital neutropenia: the recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU/kg/day (12 micrograms/kg/day) as \n\na single dose or in divided doses. Idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia: the recommended starting dose is \n\n0.5 MU/kg/day (5 micrograms/kg/day) as a single dose or in divided doses.  \n\n \n\nDose adjustment: Grastofil should be administered daily by subcutaneous injection until the neutrophil \n\ncount has reached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 10\n9\n/L. When the response has been \n\nobtained, the minimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established. Long-term daily \n\nadministration is required to maintain an adequate neutrophil count. After one to two weeks of \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\ntherapy, the initial dose may be doubled or halved depending upon the patient's response. \n\nSubsequently, the dose may be individually adjusted every 1-2 weeks to maintain the average \n\nneutrophil count between 1.5 x 10\n9\n/L and 10 x 10\n\n9\n/L.A faster schedule of dose escalation may be \n\nconsidered in patients presenting with severe infections. In clinical studies, 97% of patients who \n\nresponded had a complete response at doses of \u2264 2.4 MU/kg/day (24 micrograms/kg/day). The  \n\nlong-term safety of administration of Grastofilat doses above 2.4 MU/kg/day (24 micrograms/kg/day) \n\nin patients with SCN has not been established.  \n\n \n\nMethod of Administration \n\n \n\nCongenital, idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia: Grastofil should be given by subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nIn patients with HIV infection  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nFor reversal of neutropenia  \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Grastofil is 0.1 MU/kg/day (1 micrograms/kg/day) with titration up \n\nto a maximum of 0.4 MU/kg/day (4 micrograms/kg/day) until a normal neutrophil count is reached \n\nand can be maintained (ANC > 2.0 x 10\n9\n/L). In clinical studies, > 90% of patients responded at these \n\ndoses, achieving a reversal of neutropenia in a median of 2 days.  \n\n \n\nIn a small number of patients (< 10%), doses up to 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 micrograms/kg/day) were \n\nrequired to achieve reversal of neutropenia. \n\n \n\nFor maintenance of normal neutrophil counts  \n\nWhen reversal of neutropenia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose to maintain a normal \n\nneutrophil count should be established. Initial dose adjustment to alternate day dosing with 30 MU/day \n\n(300 micrograms/day) is recommended. Further dose adjustment may be necessary, as determined by \n\nthe patient's ANC, to maintain the neutrophil count at > 2.0 x 10\n9\n/L. In clinical studies, dosing with 30 \n\nMU/day (300 micrograms/day) on 1 - 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC  \n\n> 2.0 x 10\n9\n/L, with the median dose frequency being 3 days per week. Long-term administration may \n\nbe required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 10\n9\n/L.  \n\n \n\nMethod of Administration \n\n \n\nReversal of neutropenia or maintaining normal neutrophil counts: Grastofil should be given by \n\nsubcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nElderly patients  \n\nClinical studies with filgrastim have included a small number of elderly patients but special studies \n\nhave not been performed in this group and therefore specific posology recommendations cannot be \n\nmade. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal/hepatic impairment  \n\nStudies of filgrastim in patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function demonstrate that it \n\nexhibits a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals. \n\nDose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients in the SCN and cancer settings  \n\nSixty-five percent of patients studied in a SCN trial program, were under 18 years of age. The efficacy \n\nof treatment was clear for this age group, which included most patients with congenital neutropenia. \n\nThere were no differences in the safety profiles for paediatric patients treated for SCN. \n\n \n\nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nsimilar in both adults, children and adolescents  receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nThe dose recommendations in paediatric patients are the same as those in adults receiving \n\nmyelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability  \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n\n \n\nSpecial warnings and precautions across indications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \n\nbeen reported in patients treated with filgrastim. Permanently discontinue filgrastim in patients with \n\nclinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer filgrastim to patients with a history of \n\nhypersensitivity to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.  \n\n \n\nPulmonary adverse reactions \n\nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial lung disease, have been reported after G-CSF \n\nadministration. Patients with a recent history of lung infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. \n\nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs \n\nof pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of Acute \n\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Filgrastim should be discontinued and appropriate treatment \n\ngiven. \n\n \n\nGlomerulonephritis \n\nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \n\nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \n\npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome  \n\nCapillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported after \n\ngranulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration, and is characterised by hypotension, \n\nhypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak \n\nsyndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may \n\ninclude a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSplenomegaly and Splenic rupture \n\nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture have been reported in \n\npatients and normal donors following administration of filgrastim. Some cases of splenic rupture were \n\nfatal. Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A \n\ndiagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in donors and/or patients reporting left upper \n\nabdominal or shoulder tip pain. Dose reductions of filgrastim have been noted to slow or stop the \n\nprogression of splenic enlargement in patients with severe chronic neutropenia, and in 3% of patients a \n\nsplenectomy was required. \n\n \n\nMalignant cell growth \n\nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects \n\nmay be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nMyelodysplastic syndrome or Chronic myeloid leukemia \n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or \n\nchronic myelogenous leukaemia have not been established. Filgrastim is not indicated for use in these \n\nconditions. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast transformation of \n\nchronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. \n\n \n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia \n\nIn view of limited safety and efficacy data in patients with secondary AML, filgrastim should be \n\nadministered with caution. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in de novo AML \n\npatients aged < 55 years with good cytogenetics [t(8; 21), t(15; 17), and inv(16)] have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nThrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim. Platelet counts should be \n\nmonitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Consideration should be \n\ngiven to temporary discontinuation or dose reduction of filgrastim in patients with severe chronic \n\nneutropenia who develop thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 x 10\n9\n/l). \n\n \n\nLeukocytosis \n\nWhite blood cell counts of 100 x 10\n9\n/L or greater have been observed in less than 5% of cancer \n\npatients receiving filgrastim at doses above 0.3 MU/kg/day (3 \u00b5g/kg/day). No undesirable effects \n\ndirectly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis have been reported. However, in view of the \n\npotential risks associated with severe leukocytosis, a white blood cell count should be performed at \n\nregular intervals during filgrastim therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 10\n9\n/L  after the expected \n\nnadir, filgrastim should be discontinued immediately. When administered for PBPC mobilisation, \n\nfilgrastim should be discontinued or its dosage should be reduced if the leukocyte counts rise to  \n\n> 70 x 10\n9\n/L. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \n\nantibodies against filgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \n\nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present. \n\n \n\nAortitis \n\nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \n\nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \n\nmarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \n\nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8.  \n\n \n\nSpecial warning and precautions associated with co-morbidities \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease \n\nSickle cell crises, in some cases fatal, have been reported with the use of filgrastim in patients with \n\nsickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Physicians should use caution when prescribing filgrastim in \n\npatients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. \n\n \n\nOsteoporosis \n\nMonitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases \n\nwho undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in cancer patients \n\n \n\nFilgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established \n\ndosage regimens. \n\n \n\nRisks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy \n\nSpecial caution should be used when treating patients with high dose chemotherapy because improved \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\ntumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic medicinaal \n\nproducts may lead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic and dermatologic \n\neffects (please refer to the prescribing information of the specific chemotherapy medicinal products \n\nused). \n\n \n\nEffect of chemotherapy on erythrocytes and thrombocytes \n\nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \n\nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy. Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy \n\n(e.g. full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and \n\nanaemia. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should \n\nbe taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic medicinal products which are \n\nknown to cause severe thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nThe use of filgrastim-mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of \n\nthrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nOther special precautions \n\nThe effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been \n\nstudied. Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil \n\ncounts. Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors, neutrophil response may be diminished (such \n\nas those treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration \n\nby tumour). \n\nVascular disorders, including veno-occlusive disease and fluid volume disturbances, have been \n\nreported occasionally in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation. \n\nThere have been reports of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF \n\nafter allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \n\nassociated with transient abnormal bone scans. This should be considered when interpreting bone-\n\nimaging results. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in patients undergoing PBPC mobilisation \n\n \n\nMobilisation  \n\nThere are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods \n\n(filgrastim alone, or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient \n\npopulation. The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of \n\nCD34\n+\n cells mean that direct comparison between different studies is difficult. It is therefore difficult \n\nto recommend an optimal method. The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in relation \n\nto the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient.  \n\n \n\nPrior exposure to cytotoxic medicinal products  \n\nPatients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy may not show sufficient \n\nmobilisation of PBPC to achieve the recommended minimum yield (2.0 x 10\n6\n CD34\n\n+\n cells/kg) or \n\nacceleration of platelet recovery to the same degree. \n\n \n\nSome cytotoxic medicinal products exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool \n\nand may adversely affect progenitor mobilisation. Medicinal products such as melphalan, carmustine \n\n(BCNU) and carboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor \n\nmobilisation, may reduce progenitor yield. However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or \n\ncarmustine (BCNU) together with filgrastim has been shown to be effective for progenitor \n\nmobilisation. When peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation is envisaged it is advisable to plan \n\nthe stem cell mobilisation procedure early in the treatment course of the patient. Particular attention \n\nshould be paid to the number of progenitors mobilised in such patients before the administration of \n\nhigh-dose chemotherapy. If yields are inadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms \n\nof treatment not requiring progenitor support should be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nAssessment of progenitor cell yields \n\nIn assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular \n\nattention should be paid to the method of quantitation. The results of flow cytometric analysis of \n\nCD34\n+ \n\ncell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and therefore, recommendations \n\nof numbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution. \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34\n+\n cells re-infused and the rate of \n\nplatelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship. \n\n \n\nThe recommendation of a minimum yield of \u2265 2.0 x 10\n6 \n\nCD34\n+\n cells/kg is based on published \n\nexperience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution. Yields in excess of this minimum yield \n\nappear to correlate with more rapid recovery; those below with slower recovery. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in normal donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilisation \n\n \n\nMobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be \n\nconsidered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\nPBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory \n\neligibility criteria for stem cell donation with special attention to haematological values and infectious \n\ndiseases.  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim has not been assessed in normal donors less than 16 years or \n\ngreater than 60 years of age.  \n\n \n\nTransient thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 10\n9\n/L) following filgrastim administration and \n\nleukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied. Among these, two cases of platelets  \n\n< 50 x 10\n9/L were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure.  \n\n \n\nIf more than one leukapheresis is required, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets \n\n< 100 x 10\n9\n/L prior to leukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets are  \n\n< 75 x 10\n9\n/L.  \n\n \n\nLeukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects \n\nin haemostasis.  \n\n \n\nDonors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be monitored until haematological indices \n\nreturn to normal.  \n\n \n\nTransient cytogenetic abnormalities have been observed in normal donors following G-CSF use. The \n\nsignificance of these changes is unknown. Nevertheless, a risk of promotion of a malignant myeloid \n\nclone cannot be excluded. It is recommended that the apheresis centre perform a systematic record and \n\ntracking of the stem cell donors for at least 10 years to ensure monitoring of long-term safety. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in recipients of allogeneic PBPC mobilised with filgrastim \n\nCurrent data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the \n\nrecipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with \n\nbone marrow transplantation. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in SCN patients \n\n \n\nFilgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia who develop \n\nleukaemia or have evidence of leukaemic evolution. \n\n \n\nBlood cell counts \n\nOther blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, \n\nwhich require close monitoring of cell counts. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nTransformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome \n\nSpecial care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic \n\ndisorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia and myeloid leukaemia. Complete blood cell \n\ncounts with differential and platelet counts and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and \n\nkaryotype should be performed prior to treatment. \n\n \n\nThere was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in \n\nclinical trial patients with SCN treated with filgrastim. This observation has only been made in \n\npatients with congenital neutropenia. MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease \n\nand are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy. A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had \n\nnormal cytogenetic evaluations at baseline was subsequently found to have abnormalities, including \n\nmonosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation. It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of \n\npatients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic \n\ntransformation. It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow \n\nexaminations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months). \n\n \n\nOther special precautions \n\nCauses of transient neutropenia such as viral infections should be excluded. \n\n \n\nHaematuria was common and proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients. Regular urinalysis \n\nshould be performed to monitor this event. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nSpecial precautions in patients with HIV infection \n\n \n\nBlood cell counts \n\nANC should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Some \n\npatients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in neutrophil count to the initial \n\ndose of filgrastim. It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for the first 2 to 3 days of \n\nfilgrastim administration. Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is measured at least twice \n\nweekly for the first two weeks and subsequently once per week or once every other week during \n\nmaintenance therapy. During intermittent dosing with 30 MU (300 microgram)/day of filgrastim, there \n\ncan be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time. In order to determine a patient's trough or \n\nnadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement immediately prior \n\nto any scheduled dosing with filgrastim. \n\n \n\nRisk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medications \n\nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \n\nmyelosuppressive medicinal products. As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater \n\nnumber of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of \n\ndeveloping thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see \n\nabove). \n\n \n\nInfections and malignancies causing myelosuppression \n\nNeutropenia may be due to bone marrow infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium \n\navium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma. In patients with known bone marrow-infiltrating \n\ninfections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition in \n\naddition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia. The effects of filgrastim on \n\nneutropenia due to bone marrow-infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established. \n\n \n\nAll patients \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 50 mg sorbitol. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) \n\nmust not be given this medicinal product unless strictly necessary. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \n\nmay cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy have not been definitively established. In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing \n\nmyeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended \n\nin the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence from a small \n\nnumber of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5-Fluorouracil indicates that the severity \n\nof neutropenia may be exacerbated. \n\n \n\nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been \n\ninvestigated in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nSince lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, it is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim. \n\nAlthough this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an \n\ninteraction is harmful. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity.  An increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed \n\nin rabbits at high multiples of the clinical exposure and in the presence of maternal toxicity (see \n\nsection 5.3).  There are reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in \npregnant women has been demonstrated.  \n\n \n\nFilgrastim is not recommended during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether filgrastim / metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \n\nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue  \n\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from filgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of \n\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nFilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3). \n\nThe impact of filgrastim on human fertility is not known. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nFilgrastim has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur \n\nfollowing the administration of filgrastim (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\n \n\nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during filgrastim treatment include: anaphylactic \n\nreaction, serious pulmonary adverse events (including interstitial pneumonia and ARDS), capillary \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nleak syndrome, severe splenomegaly/splenic rupture, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome or \n\nleukaemia in SCN patients, GvHD in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transfer or peripheral \n\nblood cell progenitor cell transplant and sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain (which includes \n\nbone pain, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal \n\nchest pain, neck pain), anaemia, vomiting, and nausea. In clinical studies in cancer patients \n\nmusculoskeletal pain was mild or moderate in 10%, and severe in 3% of patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe data in the tables below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical studies and spontaneous \n\nreporting.

Overall, reports were more common after intravenous administration. In \n\nsome cases, symptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. Filgrastim \n\nshould be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.  \n\n \n\nPulmonary adverse reactions \n\nIn clinical studies and the post-marketing setting pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial \n\nlung disease, pulmonary oedema, and lung infiltration have been reported in some cases with an \n\noutcome of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \n\nCases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported following administration of filgrastim. \n\nSome cases of splenic rupture were fatal (see section 4.4).   \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome \n\nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use. \n\nThese have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, using multiple \n\nchemotherapy medicinal products or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCutaneous vasculitis \n\nCutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim. The mechanism of vasculitis \n\nin patients receiving filgrastim is unknown. During long-term use cutaneous vasculitis has been \n\nreported in 2% of SCN patients. \n\n \n\nLeukocytosis \n\nLeukocytosis (WBC > 50 x 10\n9\n/L) was observed in 41% of normal donors and transient \n\nthrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 10\n9\n/L) following filgrastim treatment and leukapheresis was \n\nobserved in 35% of donors (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSweets syndrome \n\nCases of Sweets syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with filgrastim. \n\n \n\nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) \n\nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) has been reported in cancer patients treated with \n\nfilgrastim. \n\n \n\nGvHD \n\nThere have been reports of GvHD and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF after allogeneic bone \n\nmarrow transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \n\nsimilar in both adults, children and adolescents receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy suggesting no   age-\n\nrelated differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. The only consistently reported adverse event \n\nwas musculoskeletal pain which is no different from the experience in the adult population. \n\nThere is insufficient data to further evaluate filgrastim use in paediatric subjects.  \n\n \n\nOther special populations  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects over 65 years of age \n\ncompared to younger adult (>18 years of age) subjects receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and clinical \n\nexperience has not identified differences in the responses between elderly and younger adult patients. \n\nThere is insufficient data to evaluate filgrastim use in elderly subjects for other approved Grastofil \n\nindications.  \n\n  \n\nPaediatric SCN patients \n\nCases of decreased bone density and osteoporosis have been reported in paediatric patients with severe \n\nchronic neutropenia receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThe effects of Grastofil overdose have not been established. Discontinuation of filgrastim therapy \n\nusually results in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days, with a return to normal \n\nlevels in 1 to 7 days. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors, ATC code: L03AA02 \n\n \n\nGrastofil is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nHuman G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils \n\nfrom the bone marrow. Grastofil containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in \n\nperipheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some SCN \n\npatients, filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and \n\nbasophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia \n\nalready prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses. \n\nNeutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by \n\ntests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating \n\nneutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to significant reductions in the \n\nincidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Treatment with filgrastim \n\nsignificantly reduces the duration of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospitalisation after \n\ninduction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myeloablative therapy followed by bone \n\nmarrow transplantation. The incidence of fever and documented infections were not reduced in either \n\nsetting. The duration of fever was not reduced in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed \n\nby bone marrow transplantation.  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim, either alone, or after chemotherapy, mobilises haematopoietic progenitor cells into \n\nperipheral blood. These autologous PBPCs may be harvested and infused after high-dose cytotoxic \n\ntherapy, either in place of, or in addition to bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of PBPCs \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\naccelerates haematopoietic recovery reducing the duration of risk for haemorrhagic complications and \n\nthe need for platelet transfusions.  \n\n \n\nRecipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim experienced significantly more rapid \n\nhaematological recovery, leading to a significant decrease in time to unsupported platelet recovery \n\nwhen compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.  \n\n \n\nOne retrospective European study evaluating the use of G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow \n\ntransplantation in patients with acute leukaemias suggested an increase in the risk of GvHD, treatment \n\nrelated mortality (TRM) and mortality when G-CSF was administered. In a separate retrospective \n\ninternational study in patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, no effect on the risk of \n\nGvHD, TRM and mortality was seen. A meta-analysis of allogeneic transplant studies, including the \n\nresults of nine prospective randomised studies, 8 retrospective studies and 1 case-controlled study, did \n\nnot detect an effect on the risks of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD or early treatment-related mortality.  \n\n \n\nRelative risk (95% CI) of GvHD and TRM following treatment with G-CSF after bone \n\nmarrow (BM) transplantation \n\nPublication  Period of \n\nstudy \n\nN Acute grade          \n\nII - IV GvHD \n\nChronic \n\nGvHD \n\nTRM \n\nMeta-Analysis   \n\n(2003)  \n\n1986 \u2013 2001\na\n \n\n 1198  1.08 \n\n(0.87, 1.33)  \n\n1.02 \n\n(0.82, 1.26)  \n\n0.70 \n\n(0.38, 1.31)  \n\nEuropean \n\nRetrospective  \n\nStudy (2004)  \n\n1992 \u2013 2002\nb\n \n\n 1789  1.33 \n\n    (1.08, 1.64)  \n\n1.29 \n\n(1.02, 1.61)  \n\n1.73 \n\n(1.30, 2.32)  \n\nInternational \n\nRetrospective  \n\nStudy (2006)  \n\n1995 \u2013 2000\nb\n \n\n 2110  1.11 \n\n  (0.86, 1.42)  \n\n1.10 \n\n(0.86, 1.39)  \n\n1.26 \n\n(0.95, 1.67)  \n\na\n \n\nAnalysis includes studies involving BM transplant during this period; some studies used GM-CSF  \nb\n \n\nAnalysis includes patients receiving BM transplant during this period  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim for the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC \n\ntransplantation  \n\n \n\nIn normal donors, a 10 micrograms/kg/day dose administered subcutaneously for 4 - 5 consecutive \n\ndays allows a collection of \u2265 4 x 10\n6 \n\n \n\nCD34\n+\n cells/kg recipient body weight in the majority of the \n\ndonors after two leukaphereses.  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim in patients, children or adults, with SCN (severe congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic \n\nneutropenia) induces a sustained increase in ANCs in peripheral blood and a reduction of infection and \n\nrelated events.  \n\n \n\nUse of filgrastim in patients with HIV infection maintains normal neutrophil counts to allow scheduled \n\ndosing of antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive treatments. There is no evidence that patients with \n\nHIV infection treated with filgrastim show an increase in HIV replication. \n\n \n\nAs with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on \n\nhuman endothelial cells. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of recommended doses, serum concentrations were maintained \n\nabove 10 ng/mL for 8 - 16 hours.  \n\nDistribution  \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution in blood is approximately 150 mL/kg.  \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nElimination  \n\n \n\nClearance of filgrastim has been shown to follow first-order pharmacokinetics after both subcutaneous \n\nand intravenous administration. The serum elimination half-life of filgrastim is approximately 3.5 \n\nhours, with a clearance rate of approximately 0.6 mL/min/kg. Continuous infusion with filgrastim over \n\na period of up to 28 days, in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation, \n\nresulted in no evidence of drug accumulation and comparable half-lives.  \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\n \n\nThere is a positive linear correlation between the dose and the serum concentration of filgrastim, \n\nwhether administered intravenously or subcutaneously.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nFilgrastim was studied in repeated dose toxicity studies up to 1 year in duration which revealed \n\nchanges attributable to the expected pharmacological actions including increases in leukocytes, \n\nmyeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, extramedullary granulopoiesis and splenic enlargement. These \n\nchanges all reversed after discontinuation of treatment. \n\n \n\nEffects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. Intravenous  \n\n(80 \u03bcg/kg/day) administration of filgrastim to rabbits during the period of organogenesis was \n\nmaternally toxic and increased spontaneous abortion, post-implantation loss, and decreased mean live \n\nlitter size and fetal weight were observed. \n\n \n\nBased on reported data for another filgrastim product similar to Grastofil, comparable findings plus \n\nincreased fetal malformations were observed at 100 \u03bcg/kg/day, a maternally toxic dose which \n\ncorresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately 50-90 times the exposures observed in patients \n\ntreated with the clinical dose of 5 \u03bcg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect level for embryo-fetal \n\ntoxicity in this study was 10 \u03bcg/kg/day, which corresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately \n\n3-5 times the exposures observed in patients treated with the clinical dose. \n\n \n\nIn pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal toxicity was observed at doses up to 575 \u03bcg/kg/day. Offspring of \n\nrats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods, exhibited a delay in external \n\ndifferentiation and growth retardation (\u226520 \u03bcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate  \n\n(100 \u03bcg/kg/day).  \n\n \n\nFilgrastim had no observed effect on the fertility of male or female rats. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \n\nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C, unless \n\ndilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2 \u00b0C \u2013 8 \u00b0C). Do not freeze.  \n\nKeep the syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nAccidental one-time exposure to freezing temperatures does not adversely affect the stability of \n\nGrastofil. If exposure has been greater than 24 hours or frozen more than once then Grastofil should \n\nnot be used. \n\n \n\nWithin its shelf-life and for the purpose of ambulatory use, the patient may remove Grastofil from the \n\nrefrigerator and store it at room temperature (not above 25\u00b0C) for one single period of up to 15 days. \n\nAt the end of this period, Grastofil should not be put back in the refrigerator and should be disposed of \n\nin accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n\n \n\n Type I glass pre-filled syringe with permanently attached stainless steel needle in the tip and 1/40 \n\nprinted markings for graduations from 0.1 mL to 1 mL on the barrel. The needle cover of the pre-filled \n\nsyringe contains dry natural rubber (latex, see section 4.4). Each pre-filled syringe contains 0.5 mL \n\nsolution. \n\n \n\nPack sizes: Cartons containing 1 or 5 pre-filled syringes. \n\n \n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nIf required, Grastofil may be diluted in 5% glucose solution for injection/infusion. Dilution to a final \n\nconcentration less than 0.2 MU (2 \u00b5g) per mL is not recommended at any time. \n\n \n\nThe solution should be visually inspected prior to use. Only clear solutions without particles should be \n\nused. Do not shake.  \n\n \n\nFor patients treated with filgrastim diluted to concentrations below 1.5 MU (15 \u00b5g) per mL, human \n\nserum albumin (HSA) should be added to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. Example: In a final \n\ninjection volume of 20 mL, total doses of filgrastim less than 30 MU (300 \u00b5g) should be given with \n\n0.2 mL of 200 mg/mL (20%) human albumin solution added. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nGrastofil contains no preservative. In view of the possible risk of microbial contamination, Grastofil \n\npre-filled syringes are for single use only. \n\n \n\nWhen diluted in 5% glucose, Grastofil is compatible with glass and a variety of plastics including \n\nPVC, polyolefin (a co-polymer of polypropylene and polyethylene) and polypropylene. \n\n \n\nDisposal  \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

You may need to read it again. \n\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Grastofil is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Grastofil is \n\nGrastofil contains the active substance filgrastim. Grastofil is a white blood cell growth factor \n\n(granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and belongs to a group of medicines called cytokines. Growth \n\nfactors are proteins that are produced naturally in the body but they can also be made using \n\nbiotechnology for use as a medicine. Grastofil works by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more \n\nwhite blood cells.  \n\n \n\nA reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes \n\nyour body less able to fight infection. Filgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new \n\nblood cells are made) to produce more white blood cells that help fight infection.  \n\n \n\nWhat Grastofil is used for \n\nYour doctor has prescribed Grastofil,  which is used to treat neutropenia (nu-tro-peen-ee-ah), a \n\ncondition where the body makes too few neutrophils. Neutropenia may be a long-standing condition \n\nwhere your body does not make enough neutrophils, or it may be caused by drugs used to treat cancer. \n\nIn some cases, your body may make enough neutrophils, but as a part of your treatment for cancer, \n\nyour doctor may want to increase the number of certain blood cells (CD34 cells) and collect them. The \n\ncells are collected using a process called apheresis (ay-fer-ree-sis). These collected cells are given \n\nback to you after you receive very high doses of treatment for cancer to make your blood counts get \n\nback to normal more quickly. Your doctor will tell you why you are being treated with Grastofil.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nGrastofil can be used: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent \ninfections; \n\n\uf0b7 to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent \ninfections; \n\n\uf0b7 to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help \nprevent infections; \n\n\uf0b7 in patients with advanced HIV infection which will help reduce the risk of infections;  \n\n\uf0b7 before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be \ncollected and given back to you after your treatment. These can be taken from you or from a \n\ndonor. The stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Grastofil \n\n \n\nDo not use Grastofil \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to filgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Grastofil. \n\n \n\nPlease tell your doctor before starting treatment if you have: \n\n   \n\n\uf0b7 osteoporosis (bone disease), \n\n\uf0b7 sickle cell anaemia, as filgrastim may cause sickle cell crisis. \n \n\nPlease tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Grastofil, if you:  \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, \ntongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these \n\ncould be signs of a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity). \n\n\uf0b7 experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you \nnotice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis). \n\n\uf0b7 get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left \nshoulder (these may be symptoms of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), or possibly rupture of \n\nthe spleen).  \n\n\uf0b7 notice unusual bleeding or bruising (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets \n(thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot). \n\nInflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) \n\nhas been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, \n\nabdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you \n\nexperience these symptoms.  \n\nLoss of response to filgrastim \n\nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your \n\ndoctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which \n\nneutralise filgrastim\u2019s activity. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the \n\nblood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)). You should talk to your doctor about your risks \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nof developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to \n\ndevelop cancers of the blood, you should not use Grastofil, unless instructed by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between16 and 60 years. \n\n \n\nTake special care with other medicines that stimulate white blood cells \nGrastofil is one of a group of medicines that stimulate the production of white blood cells. Your \n\nhealthcare professional should always record the exact medicine you are using. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Grastofil \nYou should not receive Grastofil in the 24 hours before and the 24 hours after receiving \n\nchemotherapy. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nGrastofil has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women.  \n\n \n\nIt is important to tell your doctor if you: \n\n\uf0b7 are pregnant; or breast-feeding; \n\n\uf0b7 think you may be pregnant, or \n\n\uf0b7 are planning to have a baby. \n \n\nIf you become pregnant during Grastofil treatment, please inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nUnless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Grastofil.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nGrastofil may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. This medicine may \n\ncause dizziness. It is advisable to wait and see how you feel after receiving Grastofil and before \n\ndriving or operating machinery. \n\n \n\nGrastofil contains sorbitol \n\nGrastofil contains 50 mg sorbitol in each ml.  \n\nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare \n\ngenetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break \n\ndown fructose, which may cause serious side effects. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your \n\nchild can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects \n\nsuch as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nGrastofil contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\n\nfree\u2019.  \n\n \n\nGrastofil pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber \n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex) which may \n\ncause an allergic reaction. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Grastofil \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Grastofil varies depending on your illness and weight. Your doctor will tell you how \n\nmuch Grastofil you should take.  \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\nDose \n\n \n\nGrastofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) associated with chemotherapy  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day. For example, \n\nif you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 30 million units (300 micrograms). Your treatment \n\nwith Grastofil will usually last for about 14 days. In some disease types, however, longer treatment \n\nlasting up to about one month may be required. \n\n \n\nGrastofil and bone marrow transplantation  \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose is 1 million units (10 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day given \n\nas an infusion. For example, if you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 60 million units (600 \n\nmicrograms). You will normally receive your first dose of Grastofil at least 24 hours after your \n\nchemotherapy and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. Your doctor may \n\nthen test your blood to see how well the treatment is working and how long it should last. \n\n \n\nGrastofil and severe chronic neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells)  \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose is between 0.5 million units  (5 micrograms) and 1.2 million units (12 \n\nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day in a single or divided dose. Your doctor may then test \n\nyour blood to see how well your treatment with Grastofil is working and to find the dose that is best \n\nfor you. Long-term treatment with Grastofil is required for reduction in neutropenia. \n\n \n\nGrastofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) in patients with HIV infection  \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose is between 0.1 million units (1 micrograms) and 0.4 million units (4 \n\nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Your doctor may test your blood at regular intervals \n\nto see how well the Grastofil treatment is working. Once the number of white cells in your blood has \n\nreturned to normal it may be possible to reduce the dose frequency to less than once per day. Long \n\nterm treatment with Grastofil may be required to maintain a normal number of white cells in your \n\nblood.  \n\n \n\nGrastofil and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (stem cells collected from the blood to use in \n\nbone marrow transplantation) \n\n \n\nIf you are donating stem cells for yourself, the usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) to 1 \n\nmillion units (10 micrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Grastofil treatment will last for up \n\nto 2 weeks. Your doctor will monitor your blood to determine the best time to collect the stem cells.  \n\n \n\nIf you are acting as a stem cell donor for another person, the usual dose is 1 million units (10 \n\nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Grastofil treatment will last for 4 to 5 days. Your \n\ndoctor will perform regular blood tests to determine the best time to collect the stem cells. \n\n \n\nHow Grastofil is given \n \n\nGrastofil  is usually given as a daily injection  into the tissue just under the skin (known as a \n\nsubcutaneous injection). It can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an \n\nintravenous infusion).  \n\n \n\nIf you are receiving this medicine by subcutaneous injection, your doctor may suggest that you learn \n\nhow to give yourself the injections. Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do this \n\n(see information below on instructions for injecting Grastofil). Do not attempt to self-administer \n\nwithout this training. Some of the information you require is given at the end of this leaflet, but proper \n\ntreatment of your disease requires close and constant co-operation with your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nHow long will I have to take Grastofil? \n\n \n\nYou will need to take Grastofil until your white blood cell count is normal. Regular blood tests will \n\nbe taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. Your doctor will tell you how long \n\nyou will need to take Grastofil. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n \n\nGrastofil is used to treat children and adolescents who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from \n\nsevere low white blood cell count (neutropenia). The dosing in children and adolescents receiving \n\nchemotherapy is the same as for adults. \n\n \n\nInstructions for injecting Grastofil \n \n\nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Grastofil.  \n\n \n\nImportant: do not try to give yourself an injection unless you have received training from your doctor \n\nor nurse.  \n\n \n\nGrastofil is injected into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a subcutaneuous injection. \n\n \n\nEquipment that you need \n\n \n\nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  \n\n\uf0b7 a new pre-filled syringe of Grastofil; and  \n\n\uf0b7 alcohol wipes or similar.  \n\n \n\nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Grastofil?  \n\n \n\n1. Remove the syringe from the refrigerator. Leave the syringe at room temperature  \n(15\u00baC to 25 \u00baC)  for approximately 30 minutes or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand \n\nfor a few minutes. This will make the injection more comfortable. Do not warm Grastofil in any \n\nother way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). \n\n2. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. \n3. Do not remove the needle cover until you are ready to inject. \n4. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n5. Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach. \n\n \n\nHow do I prepare my Grastofil injection?  \n\n \n\nBefore you inject Grastofil you must do the following:  \n\n1. To avoid bending the needle, gently pull the cover from the needle without twisting. \n2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger.  \n3. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do not need to remove the air \n\nbubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless.   \n\n4. The Grastofil syringe has a scale on the syringe barrel. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing \nup. Push the plunger up slowly to the number (given in mL) that matches the dose of Grastofil \n\nwhich your doctor has prescribed. \n\n5. You can now use the pre-filed syringe, \n\n \n\nWhere should I give my injection?  \n\n \n\nThe best places to inject are the top of the thighs and the abdomen. If someone else is injecting you, \n\nthey can also use the back of your arms. \n\n \n\nYou may change the injection site if you notice the area is red or sore. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n      \n \n\nHow do I give my injection?  \n\n \n\n1. Disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe and pinch (without squeezing) the skin between \nyour thumb and forefinger.  \n\n2. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor.  \n3. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood \n\nin the syringe, pull the needle out and re-insert it in another place.  \n\n4. Push the plunger with a slow constant pressure, always keeping your skin pinched, until the \nsyringe is empty. \n\n5. Remove the needle and let go of your skin. Do not put the cover back on used needles, as you \nmay accidentally prick yourself. \n\n6. If you notice a spot of blood you may gently dab it away with a cotton ball or tissue. Do not rub \nthe injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster.  \n\n7. Only use each syringe for one injection. Do not use any Grastofil that may be left in the syringe. \n \n\n  \n \n\nRemember:  if you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more Grastofil than you should \n \n\nIf you use more Grastofil than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Grastofil \n\n \n\nIf you have missed an injection, contact your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten injection. Contact your doctor to discuss when \n\nyou should inject the next dose. \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately during treatment if: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the \n\nface, lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).  \n\n\uf0b7 you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of Acute \nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  \n\n\uf0b7   you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients who \n\nreceived filgrastim. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or \n\nankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual. \n\n\uf0b7 you have any of the following or a combination of the following side effects:  \no swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, \n\ndifficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling \n\nof tiredness. These symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion.  \n\nThese could be symptoms of a condition called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes blood \n\nto leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention.  \n\n\uf0b7 you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: \no fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, \n\nshortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin. \n\nThese could be symptoms of a condition called \u201csepsis\u201d (also called \"blood poisoning\"), a \n\nsevere infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and \n\nneeds urgent medical attention. \n\n\uf0b7 you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your \nshoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) \n\nor rupture of the spleen). \n\n\uf0b7 you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine \n(haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if \n\nprotein is found in your urine (proteinuria). \n\n \n\nA common side effect of Grastofil use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), which \n\ncan be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a stem cell \n\nor bone marrow transplant, Graft versus host disease (GvHD) may occur- this is a reaction of the \n\ndonor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms \n\nof your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, \n\nlungs, vagina and joints.  \n\n \n\nIn normal stem cell donors an increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) and a decrease of platelets \n\nmay be seen, this reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia), these will be monitored \n\nby your doctor. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n\uf0b7 decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot (thrombocytopenia) \n\n\uf0b7 low red blood cell count (anaemia) \n\n\uf0b7 headache \n\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea \n\n\uf0b7 vomiting \n\n\uf0b7 nausea \n\n\uf0b7 unusual hair loss or thinning (alopecia) \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n\uf0b7 tiredness (fatigue) \n\n\uf0b7 soreness and swelling of the digestive tract lining which runs from the mouth to the anus \n(mucosal inflammation) \n\n\uf0b7 fever (pyrexia) \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lung (bronchitis) \n\n\uf0b7 upper respiratory tract infection \n\n\uf0b7 urinary tract infection \n\n\uf0b7 decreased appetite \n\n\uf0b7 trouble sleeping (insomnia) \n\n\uf0b7 dizziness \n\n\uf0b7 decreased feeling of sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoaesthesia) \n\n\uf0b7 tingling or numbness of the hands or feet (paraesthesia) \n\n\uf0b7 low blood pressure (hypotension) \n\n\uf0b7 high blood pressure (hypertension) \n\n\uf0b7 cough \n\n\uf0b7 coughing up blood (haemoptysis)  \n\n\uf0b7 pain in your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal pain) \n\n\uf0b7 nose bleeds (epistaxis) \n\n\uf0b7 constipation \n\n\uf0b7 oral pain \n\n\uf0b7 enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) \n\n\uf0b7 rash \n\n\uf0b7 redness of the skin (erythema) \n\n\uf0b7 muscle spasm \n\n\uf0b7 pain when passing urine (dysuria) \n\n\uf0b7 chest pain \n\n\uf0b7 pain \n\n\uf0b7 generalised weakness (asthenia) \n\n\uf0b7 generally feeling unwell (malaise) \n\n\uf0b7 swelling in the hands and feet (oedema peripheral) \n\n\uf0b7 increase of certain enzymes in the blood \n\n\uf0b7 changes in blood chemistry \n\n\uf0b7 transfusion reaction \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \n\n\uf0b7 increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) \n\n\uf0b7 allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) \n\n\uf0b7 rejection of transplanted bone marrow (graft versus host disease) \n\n\uf0b7 high uric acid levels in the blood, which may cause gout (hyperuricaemia) (Blood uric acid \nincreased) \n\n\uf0b7 liver damage caused by blocking of the small veins within the liver (veno-occlusive disease) \n\n\uf0b7 lungs do not function as they should, causing breathlessness (respiratory failure) \n\n\uf0b7 swelling and/or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) \n\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) \n\n\uf0b7 abnormal x-rays of the lungs (lung infiltration) \n\n\uf0b7 bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage) \n\n\uf0b7 lack of absorption of oxygen in the lung (hypoxia) \n\n\uf0b7 bumpy skin rash (rash macuo-papular) \n\n\uf0b7 disease which causes bones to become less dense, making them weaker, more brittle and likely \nto break (osteoporosis) \n\n\uf0b7 injection site reaction \n \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\n\uf0b7 severe pain in the bones, chest, gut or joints (sickle cell anaemia with crisis) \n\n\uf0b7 sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) \n\n\uf0b7 pain and swelling of the joints, similar to gout (pseudogout) \n\n\uf0b7 a change in how your body regulates fluids within your body and may result in puffiness (fluid \nvolume disturbances) \n\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous vasculitis) \n\n\uf0b7 plum-coloured, raised, painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with a fever \n(Sweets syndrome) \n\n\uf0b7 worsening of rheumatoid arthritis \n\n\uf0b7 unusual change in the urine \n\n\uf0b7 bone density decreased \n\n\uf0b7 Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the \nbody), see section 2. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects  \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Grastofil is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Grastofil is \n\n  \n\nGrastofil contains the active substance filgrastim. Grastofil is a white blood cell growth factor \n\n(granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and belongs to a group of medicines called cytokines. Growth \n\nfactors are proteins that are produced naturally in the body but they can also be made using \n\nbiotechnology for use as a medicine. Grastofil works by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more \n\nwhite blood cells.  \n\n \n\nA reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes \n\nyour body less able to fight infection.  Filgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new \n\nblood cells are made) to produce more white blood cells that help fight infection.  \n\n \n\nWhat Grastofil is used for \n\n \n\nYour doctor has prescribed Grastofil, which is used to treat neutropenia (nu-tro-peen-ee-ah), a \n\ncondition where the body makes too few neutrophils. Neutropenia may be a long-standing condition \n\nwhere your body does not make enough neutrophils, or it may be caused by drugs used to treat cancer. \n\nIn some cases, your body may make enough neutrophils, but as a part of your treatment for cancer, \n\nyour doctor may want to increase the number of certain blood cells (CD34 cells) and collect them. The \n\ncells are collected using a process called apheresis (ay-fer-ree-sis). These collected cells are given \n\nback to you after you receive very high doses of treatment for cancer to make your blood counts get \n\nback to normal more quickly. Your doctor will tell you why you are being treated with Grastofil.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\nGrastofil can be used:  \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent \ninfections;  \n\n\uf0b7 to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent \ninfections \n\n\uf0b7 to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help \nprevent infections;  \n\n\uf0b7 in patients with advanced HIV infection which will help reduce the risk of infections;   \n\n\uf0b7 before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be \ncollected and given back to you after your treatment. These can be taken from you or from a \n\ndonor. The stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Grastofil \n\n \n\nDo not use Grastofil \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to filgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Grastofil: \n\n \n\nPlease tell your doctor before starting treatment if you have: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 osteoporosis (bone disease),  \n\n\uf0b7 sickle cell anaemia, as filgrastim can cause sickle cell crisis. \n \n\nPlease tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Grastofil, if you:  \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, \ntongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these \n\ncould be signs of a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity). \n\n\uf0b7 experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you \nnotice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis). \n\n\uf0b7 get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left \nshoulder (these may be symptoms of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), or possibly rupture of \n\nthe spleen).  \n\n\uf0b7 notice unusual bleeding or bruising (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets \n(thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot). \n\nInflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) \n\nhas been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, \n\nabdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you \n\nexperience these symptoms. \n\n \n\nLoss of response to filgrastim \n\n \n\nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your \n\ndoctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which \n\nneutralise filgrastim\u2019s activity \n\n \n\nYour doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\nIf you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the \n\nblood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)). You should talk to your doctor about your risks \n\nof developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to \n\ndevelop cancers of the blood, you should not use Grastofil, unless instructed by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between16 and 60 years. \n\n   \n\nTake special care with other medicines that stimulate white blood cells \n\n \n\nGrastofil is one of a group of medicines that stimulate the production of white blood cells. Your \n\nhealthcare professional should always record the exact medicine you are using. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Grastofil \n \n\nYou should not receive Grastofil in the 24 hours before and the 24 hours after receiving \n\nchemotherapy. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nGrastofil has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women.  \n\n \n\nIt is important to tell your doctor if you  \n\n\uf0b7 are pregnant, or breast-feeding; \n\n\uf0b7 think you may be pregnant, or  \n\n\uf0b7 plan to have a baby. \n \n\nIf you become pregnant during Grastofil treatment, please inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nUnless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Grastofil.  \n\n \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n \n\nGrastofil may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. This medicine may \n\ncause dizziness. It is advisable to wait and see how you feel after receiving Grastofil and before \n\ndriving or operating machinery. \n\n \n\nGrastofil contains sorbitol \n\n \n\nGrastofil contains 50 mg sorbitol in each ml. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) \n\nhave hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not \n\nreceive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side \n\neffects. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your \n\nchild can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects \n\nsuch as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nGrastofil contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\n\nfree\u2019.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nGrastofil pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber \n\n \n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex) which may \n\ncause an allergic reaction. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Grastofil \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Grastofil varies depending on your illness and weight. Your doctor will tell you how \n\nmuch Grastofil you should take. \n\n   \n\nDose \n\n \n\nGrastofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) associated with chemotherapy  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day. For example, \n\nif you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 30 million units (300 micrograms). Your treatment \n\nwith Grastofil will usually last for about 14 days. In some disease types, however, longer treatment \n\nlasting up to about one month may be required. \n\n \n\nGrastofil and bone marrow transplantation  \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose is 1 million units (10 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day given \n\nas an infusion. For example, if you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 60 million units (600 \n\nmicrograms). You will normally receive your first dose of Grastofil at least 24 hours after your \n\nchemotherapy and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. Your doctor may \n\nthen test your blood to see how well the treatment is working and how long it should last. \n\n \n\nGrastofil and severe chronic neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells)  \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose is between 0.5 million units  (5 micrograms) and 1.2 million units (12 \n\nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day in a single or divided dose. Your doctor may then test \n\nyour blood to see how well your treatment with Grastofil is working and to find the dose that is best \n\nfor you. Long-term treatment with Grastofil is required for reduction in neutropenia. \n\n \n\nGrastofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) in patients with HIV infection  \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose is between 0.1 million units (1 micrograms) and 0.4 million units (4 \n\nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Your doctor may test your blood at regular intervals \n\nto see how well the Grastofil treatment is working. Once the number of white cells in your blood has \n\nreturned to normal it may be possible to reduce the dose frequency to less than once per day. Long \n\nterm treatment with Grastofil may be required to maintain a normal number of white cells in your \n\nblood.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\nGrastofil and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (stem cells collected from the blood to use in \n\nbone marrow transplantation) \n\n \n\nIf you are donating stem cells for yourself, the usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) to 1 \n\nmillion units (10 micrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Grastofil treatment will last for up \n\nto 2 weeks. Your doctor will monitor your blood to determine the best time to collect the stem cells.  \n\n \n\nIf you are acting as a stem cell donor for another person, the usual dose is 1 million units (10 \n\nmicrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. Grastofil treatment will last for 4 to 5 days. Your \n\ndoctor will perform regular blood tests to determine the best time to collect the stem cells. \n\n \n\nHow Grastofil is given  \n \n\nGrastofil is usually given as a daily injection into the tissue just under the skin (known as a \n\nsubcutaneous injection). It can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an \n\nintravenous infusion).  \n\n \n\nIf you are receiving this medicine by subcutaneous injection, your doctor may suggest that you learn \n\nhow to give yourself the injections. Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do this \n\n(see information below on instructions for injecting Grastofil). Do not attempt to self-administer \n\nwithout this training. Some of the information you require is given at the end of this leaflet, but proper \n\ntreatment of your disease requires close and constant co-operation with your doctor. \n\n \n\nHow long will I have to take Grastofil? \n\n \n\nYou will need to take Grastofil until your white blood cell count is normal. Regular blood tests will \n\nbe taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. Your doctor will tell you how long \n\nyou will need to take Grastofil. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nGrastofil is used to treat children and adolescents who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from \n\nsevere low \n\nwhite blood cell count (neutropenia). The dosing in children and adolescents receiving chemotherapy \n\nis the same as \n\nfor adults. \n\n \n\nInstructions for injecting Grastofil \n\n \n\nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Grastofil.  \n\n \n\nImportant: do not try to give yourself an injection unless you have received training from your doctor \n\nor nurse.  \n\n \n\nGrastofil is injected into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a subcutaneuous injection. \n\n \n\nEquipment that you need  \n\n \n\nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  \n\n\uf0b7 a new pre-filled syringe of Grastofil; and  \n\n\uf0b7 alcohol wipes or similar.  \n\n \n\nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Grastofil?  \n\n \n\n1. Remove the syringe from the refrigerator. Leave the syringe at room temperature (15\u00baC to 25 \n\u00baC) for approximately 30 minutes or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\nminutes. This will make the injection more comfortable. Do not warm Grastofil in any other \n\nway (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). \n\n2. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. \n3. Do not remove the needle cover until you are ready to inject. \n4. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n5. Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach. \n \n\nHow do I prepare my Grastofil injection?  \n\n \n\nBefore you inject Grastofil you must do the following:  \n\n1. To avoid bending the needle, gently pull the cover from the needle without twisting. \n2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger.  \n3. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do not need to remove the air \n\nbubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless.  \n\n4. The Grastofil syringe has a scale on the syringe barrel. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing \nup. Push the plunger up slowly to the number (given in mL) that matches the dose of Grastofil \n\nwhich your doctor has prescribed. \n\n5. You can now use the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\nWhere should I give my injection?  \n\n \n\nThe best places to inject are the top of the thighs and the abdomen. If someone else is injecting you, \n\nthey can also use the back of your arms. \n\n \n\nYou may change the injection site if you notice the area is red or sore. \n\n \n\n       \n \n\nHow do I give my injection?  \n\n \n\n1. Disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe and pinch (without squeezing) the skin between \nyour thumb and forefinger.  \n\n2. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor.  \n3. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood \n\nin the syringe, pull the needle out and re-insert it in another place.  \n\n4. Push the plunger with a slow constant pressure, always keeping your skin pinched, until the \nsyringe is empty. \n\n5. Remove the needle and let go of your skin. Do not put the cover back on used needles, as you \nmay accidentally prick yourself. \n\n6. If you notice a spot of blood you may gently dab it away with a cotton ball or tissue. Do not rub \nthe injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster.  \n\n7. Only use each syringe for one injection. Do not use any Grastofil that may be left in the syringe. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n  \n \n\nRemember:  if you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more Grastofil than you should \n \n\nIf you use more Grastofil than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Grastofil \n\n \n\nIf you have missed an injection, contact your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten injection. Contact your doctor to discuss when \n\nyou should inject the next dose. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately during treatment if: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the \n\nface, lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).  \n\n\uf0b7 you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of Acute \nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  \n\n\uf0b7 you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients who \nreceived filgrastim. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or \n\nankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual. \n\n\uf0b7 you have any of the following or a combination of the following side effects:  \no swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, \n\ndifficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling \n\nof tiredness. These symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion.  \n\nThese could be symptoms of a condition called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes the \n\nblood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention.  \n\n\uf0b7 you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: \no fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, \n\nshortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin. \n\nThese could be symptoms of a condition called \u201csepsis\u201d (also called \"blood poisoning\"), a \n\nsevere infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and \n\nneeds urgent medical attention. \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\n\uf0b7 you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your \nshoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) \n\nor rupture of the spleen). \n\n\uf0b7 you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine \n(haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if \n\nprotein is found in your urine (proteinuria). \n\n \n\nA common side effect of Grastofil use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), which \n\ncan be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a stem cell \n\nor bone marrow transplant, Graft versus host disease (GvHD) may occur- this is a reaction of the \n\ndonor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms \n\nof your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, \n\nlungs, vagina and joints.  \n\n \n\nIn normal stem cell donors an increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) and a decrease of platelets \n\nmay be seen this reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia), these will be monitored \n\nby your doctor. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n\uf0b7 decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot (thrombocytopenia) \n\n\uf0b7 low red blood cell count (anaemia) \n\n\uf0b7 headache \n\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea \n\n\uf0b7 vomiting \n\n\uf0b7 nausea \n\n\uf0b7 unusual hair loss or thinning (alopecia) \n\n\uf0b7 tiredness (fatigue) \n\n\uf0b7 soreness and swelling of the digestive tract lining which runs from the mouth to the anus \n(mucosal inflammation) \n\n\uf0b7 fever (pyrexia) \n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lung (bronchitis) \n\n\uf0b7 upper respiratory tract infection \n\n\uf0b7 urinary tract infection \n\n\uf0b7 decreased appetite \n\n\uf0b7 trouble sleeping (insomnia) \n\n\uf0b7 dizziness \n\n\uf0b7 decreased feeling of sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoaesthesia) \n\n\uf0b7 tingling or numbness of the hands or feet (paraesthesia) \n\n\uf0b7 low blood pressure (hypotension) \n\n\uf0b7 high blood pressure (hypertension) \n\n\uf0b7 cough \n\n\uf0b7 coughing up blood (haemoptysis)  \n\n\uf0b7 pain in your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal pain) \n\n\uf0b7 nose bleeds (epistaxis) \n\n\uf0b7 constipation \n\n\uf0b7 oral pain \n\n\uf0b7 enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) \n\n\uf0b7 rash \n\n\uf0b7 redness of the skin (erythema) \n\n\uf0b7 muscle spasm \n\n\uf0b7 pain when passing urine (dysuria) \n\n\uf0b7 chest pain \n\n\uf0b7 pain \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n\uf0b7 generalised weakness (asthenia) \n\n\uf0b7 generally feeling unwell (malaise) \n\n\uf0b7 swelling in the hands and feet (oedema peripheral) \n\n\uf0b7 increase of certain enzymes in the blood \n\n\uf0b7 changes in blood chemistry \n\n\uf0b7 transfusion reaction \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \n\n\uf0b7 increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) \n\n\uf0b7 allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) \n\n\uf0b7 rejection of transplanted bone marrow (graft versus host disease) \n\n\uf0b7 high uric acid levels in the blood, which may cause gout (hyperuricaemia) (Blood uric acid \nincreased) \n\n\uf0b7 liver damage caused by blocking of the small veins within the liver (veno-occlusive disease) \n\n\uf0b7 lungs do not function as they should, causing breathlessness (respiratory failure) \n\n\uf0b7 swelling and/or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) \n\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) \n\n\uf0b7 abnormal x-rays of the lungs (lung infiltration) \n\n\uf0b7 bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage) \n\n\uf0b7 lack of absorption of oxygen in the lung (hypoxia) \n\n\uf0b7 bumpy skin rash (rash macuo-papular) \n\n\uf0b7 disease which causes bones to become less dense, making them weaker, more brittle and likely \nto break (osteoporosis) \n\n\uf0b7 injection site reaction \n \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\n\uf0b7 severe pain in the bones, chest, gut or joints (sickle anaemia with cell crisis) \n\n\uf0b7 sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) \n\n\uf0b7 pain and swelling of the joints, similar to gout (pseudogout) \n\n\uf0b7 a change in how your body regulates fluids within your body and may result in puffiness \n(fluidvolume disturbances) \n\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous vasculitis) \n\n\uf0b7 plum-coloured, raised, painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with a fever \n(Sweets syndrome) \n\n\uf0b7 worsening of rheumatoid arthritis \n\n\uf0b7 unusual change in the urine \n\n\uf0b7 bone density decreased \n\n\uf0b7 Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the \nbody), see section 2. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects  \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what grastofil is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what grastofil is grastofil contains the active substance filgrastim. grastofil is a white blood cell growth factor (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and belongs to a group of medicines called cytokines. growth factors are proteins that are produced naturally in the body but they can also be made using biotechnology for use as a medicine. grastofil works by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. a reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes your body less able to fight infection. filgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new blood cells are made) to produce more white blood cells that help fight infection. what grastofil is used for your doctor has prescribed grastofil, which is used to treat neutropenia (nu-tro-peen-ee-ah), a condition where the body makes too few neutrophils. neutropenia may be a long-standing condition where your body does not make enough neutrophils, or it may be caused by drugs used to treat cancer. in some cases, your body may make enough neutrophils, but as a part of your treatment for cancer, your doctor may want to increase the number of certain blood cells (cd34 cells) and collect them. the cells are collected using a process called apheresis (ay-fer-ree-sis). these collected cells are given back to you after you receive very high doses of treatment for cancer to make your blood counts get back to normal more quickly. your doctor will tell you why you are being treated with grastofil. grastofil can be used: to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent infections; to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent infections; to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help prevent infections; in patients with advanced hiv infection which will help reduce the risk of infections; before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be collected and given back to you after your treatment. these can be taken from you or from a donor. the stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "grastofil",

of your left shoulder (these may be symptoms of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), or possibly rupture of the spleen). notice unusual bleeding or bruising (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot). inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. the symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. loss of response to filgrastim if you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which neutralise filgrastim's activity. your doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet. if you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the blood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (mds)). you should talk to your doctor about your risks 51 of developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. if you develop or are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use grastofil, unless instructed by your doctor. if you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between16 and 60 years. take special care with other medicines that stimulate white blood cells grastofil is one of a group of medicines that stimulate the production of white blood cells. your healthcare professional should always record the exact medicine you are using. other medicines and grastofil you should not receive grastofil in the 24 hours before and the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding grastofil has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women. it is important to tell your doctor if you: are pregnant; or breast-feeding; think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. if you become pregnant during grastofil treatment, please inform your doctor. unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use grastofil. driving and using machines grastofil may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. this medicine may cause dizziness. it is advisable to wait and see how you feel after receiving grastofil and before driving or operating machinery. grastofil contains sorbitol grastofil contains 50 mg sorbitol in each ml. sorbitol is a source of fructose. if you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (hfi), a rare genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. patients with hfi cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects. you must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have hfi or if your child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. grastofil contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium- free'. grastofil pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber the needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex) which may cause an allergic reaction.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "grastofil", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 23,

"Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. the usual dose of grastofil varies depending on your illness and weight. your doctor will tell you how much grastofil you should take. dose grastofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) associated with chemotherapy the usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day. for example, if you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 30 million units (300 micrograms). your treatment with grastofil will usually last for about 14 days. in some disease types, however, longer treatment lasting up to about one month may be required. grastofil and bone marrow transplantation the usual starting dose is 1 million units (10 micrograms) per kilogram of bodyweight each day given as an infusion. for example, if you weigh 60 kilograms your daily dose will be 60 million units (600 micrograms). you will normally receive your first dose of grastofil at least 24 hours after your chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. your doctor may then test your blood to see how well the treatment is working and how long it should last. grastofil and severe chronic neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) the usual starting dose is between 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) and 1.2 million units (12 micrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day in a single or divided dose. your doctor may then test your blood to see how well your treatment with grastofil is working and to find the dose that is best for you. long-term treatment with grastofil is required for reduction in neutropenia. grastofil and neutropenia (low number of a type of white blood cells) in patients with hiv infection the usual starting dose is between 0.1 million units (1 micrograms) and 0.4 million units (4 micrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. your doctor may test your blood at regular intervals to see how well the grastofil treatment is working. once the number of white cells in your blood has returned to normal it may be possible to reduce the dose frequency to less than once per day. long term treatment with grastofil may be required to maintain a normal number of white cells in your blood. grastofil and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (stem cells collected from the blood to use in bone marrow transplantation) if you are donating stem cells for yourself, the usual dose is 0.5 million units (5 micrograms) to 1 million units (10 micrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. grastofil treatment will last for up to 2 weeks. your doctor will monitor your blood to determine the best time to collect the stem cells. if you are acting as a stem cell donor for another person, the usual dose is 1 million units (10 micrograms) per kilogram bodyweight each day. grastofil treatment will last for 4 to 5 days. your doctor will perform regular blood tests to determine the best time to collect the stem cells. how grastofil is given grastofil is usually given as a daily injection into the tissue just under the skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). it can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an intravenous infusion). if you are receiving this medicine by subcutaneous injection, your doctor may suggest that you learn how to give yourself the injections. your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do this (see information below on instructions for injecting grastofil). do not attempt to self-administer without this training. some of the information you require is given at the end of this leaflet, but proper treatment of your disease requires close and constant co-operation with your doctor. how long will i have to take grastofil? you will need to take grastofil until your white blood cell count is normal. regular blood tests will be taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. your doctor will tell you how long you will need to take grastofil. use in children and adolescents grastofil is used to treat children and adolescents who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from severe low white blood cell count (neutropenia). the dosing in children and adolescents receiving chemotherapy is the same as for adults. instructions for injecting grastofil this section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of grastofil. important: do not try to give yourself an injection unless you have received training from your doctor or nurse. grastofil is injected into the tissue just under the skin. this is known as a subcutaneuous injection. equipment that you need to give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need: a new pre-filled syringe of grastofil; and alcohol wipes or similar. what should i do before i give myself a subcutaneous injection of grastofil? 1. remove the syringe from the refrigerator. leave the syringe at room temperature (15\u00bac to 25 \u00bac) for approximately 30 minutes or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. this will make the injection more comfortable. do not warm grastofil in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). 2. do not shake the pre-filled syringe. 3. do not remove the needle cover until you are ready to inject. 4. wash your hands thoroughly. 5. find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach. how do i prepare my grastofil injection? before you inject grastofil you must do the following: 1. to avoid bending the needle, gently pull the cover from the needle without twisting. 2. do not touch the needle or push the plunger. 3. you may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. you do not need to remove the air bubble before injecting. injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless. 4. the grastofil syringe has a scale on the syringe barrel. hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. push the plunger up slowly to the number (given in ml) that matches the dose of grastofil which your doctor has prescribed. 5. you can now use the pre-filed syringe, where should i give my injection? the best places to inject are the top of the thighs and the abdomen. if someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your arms. you may change the injection site if you notice the area is red or sore. how do i give my injection? 1. disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe and pinch (without squeezing) the skin between your thumb and forefinger. 2. put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor. 3. pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. if you see blood in the syringe, pull the needle out and re-insert it in another place. 4. push the plunger with a slow constant pressure, always keeping your skin pinched, until the syringe is empty. 5. remove the needle and let go of your skin. do not put the cover back on used needles, as you may accidentally prick yourself. 6. if you notice a spot of blood you may gently dab it away with a cotton ball or tissue. do not rub the injection site. if needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster. 7. only use each syringe for one injection. do not use any grastofil that may be left in the syringe. remember: if you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice. if you use more grastofil than you should if you use more grastofil than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. if you forget to use grastofil if you have missed an injection, contact your doctor as soon as possible. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten injection. contact your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition":

doctor immediately during treatment if: you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). kidney injury has been seen in patients who received filgrastim. call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual. you have any of the following or a combination of the following side effects: o swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. these symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. these could be symptoms of a condition called \"capillary leak syndrome\" which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: o fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, shortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin. these could be symptoms of a condition called \"sepsis\" (also called \"blood poisoning\"), a severe infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and needs urgent medical attention. you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your shoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) or rupture of the spleen). you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine (haematuria). your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if protein is found in your urine (proteinuria). a common side effect of grastofil use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), which can be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). in patients undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, graft versus host disease (gvhd) may occur- this is a reaction of the donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, lungs, vagina and joints. in normal stem cell donors an increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) and a decrease of platelets may be seen, this reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia), these will be monitored by your doctor. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot (thrombocytopenia) low red blood cell count (anaemia) headache diarrhoea vomiting nausea unusual hair loss or thinning (alopecia) 56 tiredness (fatigue) soreness and swelling of the digestive tract lining which runs from the mouth to the anus (mucosal inflammation) fever (pyrexia) common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): inflammation of the lung (bronchitis) upper respiratory tract infection urinary tract infection decreased appetite trouble sleeping (insomnia) dizziness decreased feeling of sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoaesthesia) tingling or numbness of the hands or feet (paraesthesia) low blood pressure (hypotension) high blood pressure (hypertension) cough coughing up blood (haemoptysis) pain in your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal pain) nose bleeds (epistaxis) constipation oral pain enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) rash redness of the skin (erythema) muscle spasm pain when passing urine (dysuria) chest pain pain generalised weakness (asthenia) generally feeling unwell (malaise) swelling in the hands and feet (oedema peripheral) increase of certain enzymes in the blood changes in blood chemistry transfusion reaction uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) rejection of transplanted bone marrow (graft versus host disease) high uric acid levels in the blood, which may cause gout (hyperuricaemia) (blood uric acid increased) liver damage caused by blocking of the small veins within the liver (veno-occlusive disease) lungs do not function as they should, causing breathlessness (respiratory failure) swelling and/or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) abnormal x-rays of the lungs (lung infiltration) bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage) lack of absorption of oxygen in the lung (hypoxia) bumpy skin rash (rash macuo-papular) disease which causes bones to become less dense, making them weaker, more brittle and likely to break (osteoporosis) injection site reaction 57 rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): severe pain in the bones, chest, gut or joints (sickle cell anaemia with crisis) sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) pain and swelling of the joints, similar to gout (pseudogout) a change in how your body regulates fluids within your body and may result in puffiness (fluid volume disturbances) inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous vasculitis) plum-coloured, raised, painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with a fever (sweets syndrome) worsening of rheumatoid arthritis unusual change in the urine bone density decreased inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body), see section 2. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v by
