NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLysodren 500 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 500 mg of mitotane. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet.  \n \nWhite, biconvex, round, scored tablets. \nThey are bisected on one side and impressed \"BL\" over \"L1\" on the other side. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of advanced (unresectable, metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma \n(ACC).  \n \nThe effect of Lysodren on non functional adrenal cortical carcinoma is not established. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and followed by a suitably experienced specialist. \n \nPosology \nTreatment in adults should be started with 2 - 3 g mitotane per day and increased progressively (e.g. at \ntwo-week intervals) until mitotane plasma levels reach the therapeutic window 14 \u2013 20 mg/L.  \n \nIf it is urgent to control Cushing\u2019s symptoms in highly symptomatic patients, higher starting doses \nbetween 4 - 6 g per day could be necessary and daily dose increased more rapidly (e.g. every week). A \nstarting dose higher than 6 g/day is generally not recommended. \n \nDose adjustments, monitoring and discontinuation \nDose adjustment is aimed to reach a therapeutic window (mitotane plasma levels 14 - 20 mg/L) which \nensures optimal use of Lysodren with acceptable safety. Indeed, neurologic toxicity has been \nassociated with levels above 20 mg/L and therefore this threshold should not be reached. There are \nsome data suggesting that mitotane plasma above 14 mg/L may result in enhanced efficacy (see \nsection 5.1). Mitotane plasma levels higher than 20 mg/L may be associated with severe undesirable \neffects and offer no further benefit in terms of efficacy. Mitotane plasma levels should therefore be \nmonitored in order to adjust the Lysodren dose and to avoid reaching toxic levels. For further \ninformation on the sample testing please contact the Marketing Authorisation Holder or its local \nrepresentative (see section 7).  \n\n \nDosing should be individually adjusted based on mitotane plasma levels monitoring and clinical \ntolerance until mitotane plasma levels reach the therapeutic window 14 - 20 mg/L. The target plasma \nconcentration is usually reached within a period of 3 to 5 months. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nMitotane plasma levels should be assessed after each dose adjustment and at frequent intervals (e.g. \nevery two weeks), until the optimal maintenance dose is reached. Monitoring should be more frequent \n(e.g. every week) when a high starting dose has been used. It should be taken into account that dose \nadjustments do not produce immediate changes in plasma levels of mitotane (see section 4.4). In \naddition, because of tissue accumulation, mitotane plasma levels should be monitored regularly (e.g. \nmonthly) once the maintenance dose has been reached. \n \nRegular monitoring (e.g. every two months) of mitotane plasma levels is also necessary after \ninterruption of treatment. Treatment can be resumed when mitotane plasma levels will be ranged \nbetween 14 - 20 mg/L. Due to the prolonged half-life, significant serum concentrations may persist for \nweeks after cessation of therapy. \n \nIf serious adverse reactions occur, such as neurotoxicity, treatment with mitotane may need to be \ntemporarily interrupted. In case of mild toxicity, the dose should be reduced until the maximum \ntolerated dose is attained. \n \nTreatment with Lysodren should be continued as long as clinical benefits are observed. If no clinical \nbenefits are observed after 3 months at optimal dose, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe experience in children is limited. \n \nThe paediatric posology of mitotane has not been well characterised but appears equivalent to that of \nadults after correction for body surface. \n \nTreatment should be initiated at 1.5 to 3.5 g/m2/day in children and adolescents with the objective of \nreaching 4 g/m2/day. Mitotane plasma levels should be monitored as for adults, with particular \nattention when plasma levels reach 10 mg/L as a quick increase in plasma levels may be observed. \nDose may be reduced after 2 or 3 months according to the mitotane plasma levels or in case of serious \ntoxicity. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere is no experience in the use of mitotane in patients with hepatic impairment, so data are \ninsufficient to give a dose recommendation in this group. Since mitotane is mainly metabolised \nthrough the liver, mitotane plasma levels are expected to increase if liver function is impaired. The use \nof mitotane in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. In patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised and monitoring of liver function should be \nperformed. Monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is specially recommended in these patients (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere is no experience in the use of mitotane in patients with renal impairment, so data are insufficient \nto give a dose recommendation in this group. The use of mitotane in patients with severe renal \nimpairment is not recommended and, in cases of mild to moderate renal impairment, caution should be \nexercised. Monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is specially recommended in these patients (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nOlder patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nThere is no experience on the use of mitotane in older patients, so data are insufficient to give a dose \nrecommendation in this group. Caution should be exercised and frequent monitoring of mitotane \nplasma levels is especially recommended in these patients. \n \nMethod of administration \nThe total daily dose may be divided in two or three doses according to patient\u2019s convenience. Tablets \nshould be taken with a glass of water during meals containing fat-rich food (see section 4.5). Patients \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nshould be advised not to use any tablets showing signs of deterioration, and caregivers to wear \ndisposable gloves when handling the tablets. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \nLactation (see section 4.6) \nConcomitant use with spironolactone (see section 4.5) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBefore the initiation of the treatment: Large metastatic masses should be surgically removed as far as \npossible before starting mitotane treatment, in order to minimise the risk of infarction and \nhaemorrhage in the tumour due to a rapid cytotoxic effect of mitotane. \n \nRisk of adrenal insufficiency: All patients with non functional tumour and 75% of patients with \nfunctional tumour show signs of adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, steroid replacement may be \nnecessary in these patients. Since mitotane increases plasma levels of steroid binding proteins, free \ncortisol and corticotropin (ACTH) determinations are necessary for optimal dosing of steroid \nsubstitution (see section 4.8). \n \nShock, severe trauma or infection: Mitotane should be temporarily discontinued immediately \nfollowing shock, severe trauma or infection, since adrenal suppression is its prime action. Exogenous \nsteroids should be administered in such circumstances, since the depressed adrenal gland may not \nimmediately start to secrete steroids. Because of an increased risk of acute adrenocortical \ninsufficiency, patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if injury, infection, \nor any other concomitant illness occurs. Patients should carry with them the Lysodren Patient Card \nprovided with the package leaflet indicating that they are prone to adrenal insufficiency and that, in \ncase of emergency care, adequate precautionary measures should be taken. \n \nMonitoring of plasma levels: Mitotane plasma levels should be monitored in order to adjust the \nmitotane dose, particularly if high starting doses are considered necessary. Dose adjustments may be \nnecessary to achieve the desired therapeutic levels in the window between 14 - 20 mg/L and avoid \nspecific adverse reactions (see section 4.2). For further information on the sample testing please \ncontact the Marketing Authorisation Holder or its local representative (see section 7). \n \nHepatic or renal impairment: There are insufficient data to support the use of mitotane in patients with \nsevere hepatic or renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate hepatic or renal impairment, \ncaution should be exercised and monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is particularly recommended \n(see section 4.2). \n \nHepatotoxicity has been observed in patients treated with mitotane. Cases of liver damage \n(hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed) and autoimmune hepatitis were observed. Liver function tests \n(alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], bilirubin levels) should be periodically \nmonitored, especially during the first months of treatment or when it is necessary to increase the dose. \n\n \nMitotane tissue accumulation: Fat tissue can act as a reservoir for mitotane, resulting in a prolonged \nhalf-life and potential accumulation of mitotane. Consequently, despite a constant dose, mitotane \nlevels may increase. Therefore, monitoring of mitotane plasma levels (e.g. every two months) is also \nnecessary after interruption of treatment, as prolonged release of mitotane can occur. Caution and \nclose monitoring of mitotane plasma levels are highly recommended when treating overweight \npatients. \n \nCentral nervous system disorders: Long-term continuous administration of high doses of mitotane \nmay lead to reversible brain damage and impairment of function. Behavioural and neurological \nassessments should be made at regular intervals, especially when mitotane plasma levels exceed \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n20 mg/L (see section 4.8). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: All blood cells can be affected with mitotane treatment. \nLeucopenia (including neutropenia), anemia and thrombocytopenia have been reported frequently \nduring mitotane treatment (see section 4.8). Red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet counts should \nbe monitored during mitotane treatment. \n \nBleeding time: Prolonged bleeding time has been reported in patients treated with mitotane and this \nshould be taken into account when surgery is considered (see section 4.8). \n \nWarfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants: When administering mitotane to patients on coumarin-\nlike anticoagulants, patients should be closely monitored for a change in anticoagulant dose \nrequirements (see section 4.5). \n \nSubstances metabolised through cytochrome P450 and particularly cytochrome 3A4: Mitotane is a \nhepatic enzyme inducer and it should be used with caution in case of concomitant use of medicinal \nproducts influenced by hepatic metabolism (see section 4.5). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential: Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception \nduring treatment with mitotane (see section 4.6). \n \nPremenopausal women: Ovarian macrocysts have been observed with higher incidence in this \npopulation. Isolated cases of complicated cysts have been reported (adnexal torsion and haemorrhagic \ncyst rupture). Improvement after mitotane discontinuation has been observed. Women should be urged \nto seek medical advice if they experience gynaecological symptoms such as bleeding and/or pelvic \npain.  \n \nPaediatric population: In children and adolescents, neuro-psychological retardation can be observed \nduring mitotane treatment. In such cases, thyroid function should be investigated in order to identify a \npossible thyroid impairment linked to mitotane treatment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSpironolactone: Mitotane must not be given in combination with spironolactone, since this active \nsubstance may block the action of mitotane (see section 4.3). \n \nWarfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants: Mitotane has been reported to accelerate the metabolism \nof warfarin through hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, leading to an increase in dose requirements \nfor warfarin. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for a change in anticoagulant dose \nrequirements when mitotane is administered to patients on coumarin-like anticoagulants.  \n \nSubstances metabolised through cytochrome P450: Mitotane has been shown to have an inductive \neffect on cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, the plasma concentrations of the substances \nmetabolised via cytochrome P450 may be modified. In the absence of information on the specific \nP450 isoenzymes involved, caution should be taken when co-prescribing active substances \nmetabolised by this route such as, among others, anticonvulsants, rifabutin, rifampicin, griseofulvin \nand St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). Particularly, mitotane has been shown to have an \ninductive effect on cytochrome 3A4. Therefore, the plasma concentrations of the substances \nmetabolised via cytochrome 3A4 may be modified. Caution should be taken when co-prescribing \nactive substances metabolised by this pathway such as, among others, sunitinib and midazolam. \n \nMedicinal products active on central nervous system: Mitotane can cause central nervous system \nundesirable effects at high concentrations (see section 4.8). Although no specific information on \npharmacodynamic interactions in the central nervous system is available, this should be borne in mind \nwhen co-prescribing medicinal products with central nervous system depressant action. \n \nFat-rich food: Data with various mitotane formulations suggest that administration with fat-rich food \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nenhances absorption of mitotane. \n \nHormone binding protein: Mitotane has been shown to increase plasma levels of hormone binding \nproteins (e.g. sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). This \nshould be taken into account when interpreting the results of hormonal assays and may result in \ngynaecomastia. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate abnormalities on the adrenals of the foetus \nafter exposure to mitotane. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with mitotane. \nAnimal studies with similar substances have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Lysodren \nshould be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed and if the clinical benefit clearly outweighs \nany potential risk to the foetus. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use an effective contraception during treatment and after \ndiscontinuation of treatment as long as mitotane plasma levels are detectable. The prolonged \nelimination of mitotane from the body after discontinuation of Lysodren should be considered. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDue to the lipophilic nature of mitotane, it is likely to be excreted in breast milk. Breast-feeding is \ncontraindicated while taking mitotane (see section 4.3) and after treatment discontinuation as long as \nmitotane plasma levels are detectable. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLysodren has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Ambulatory patients should \nbe warned not to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSafety data are based on literature (mainly retrospective studies). More than 80 % of patients treated \nwith mitotane have shown at least one type of undesirable effect. Adverse reactions listed below are \nclassified according to frequency and system organ class. Frequency groupings are defined according \nto the following convention: Very common (\u22651/10), Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), Uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), Very rare (<1/10,000), Not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Frequency of adverse reactions identified from literature data  \n Adverse reaction  \n\n \nSystem Organ Class Very common \n\n \nCommon \n\n \nNot Known \n\nInvestigations Elevated liver enzymes \nPlasma cholesterol \nincreased \nPlasma triglycerides \nincreased \n\n Blood uric acid decreased \nBlood androstenedione \ndecreased (in females) \nBlood testosterone \ndecreased (in females) \nSex hormone binding \nglobulin increased \nBlood free testosterone \ndecreased (in males) \n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nLeucopoenia \nBleeding time prolonged \n\nAnaemia \nThrombocytopenia \n\n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nAtaxia \nParesthesia \nVertigo \nSleepiness \n \n\nMental impairment \nPolyneuropathy \nMovement disorder \nDizziness \nHeadache \n \n\nBalance disorders \n\nEye disorders   Maculopathy \nRetinal toxicity  \nDiplopia \nLens opacity \nVisual impairment \nVision blurred \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nMucositis  \nVomiting  \nDiarrhoea \nNausea \nEpigastric discomfort \n\n Salivary hypersecretion \nDysgeusia \nDyspepsia \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n  Haemorrhagic cystitis \nHaematuria \nProteinuria \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nSkin rash   \n\nMuscoloskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyasthenia   \n\nEndocrine disorders Adrenal insufficiency  Thyroid impairment \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia \nHypercholesterolemia \nHypertriglyceridaemia \n\n Hypouricaemia \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n  Opportunistic mycosis \n\nVascular disorders   Hypertension \nOrthostatic hypotension \nFlushing \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nAsthenia  Hyperpyrexia \nGeneralised aching \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  Autoimmune hepatitis Liver damage \n(hepatocellular/cholestatic\n/mixed) \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders \n\nGynaecomastia  Ovarian macrocysts \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders Confusion   \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nGastrointestinal disorders are the most frequently reported (10 to 100 % of patients) and are reversible \nwhen the dose is reduced. Some of these effects (anorexia) may constitute the hallmark of initial \ncentral nervous system impairment. \n \nNervous system undesirable effects occur in approximately 40 % of patients. Other undesirable central \nnervous effects have been reported in literature such as memory defects, aggressiveness, central \nvestibular syndrome, dysarthria, or Parkinson syndrome. Serious undesirable effects appear linked to \nthe cumulative exposure to mitotane and are most likely to occur when mitotane plasma levels are at \n20 mg/L or above. At high doses and after prolonged utilization, brain function impairment can occur. \nNervous system undesirable effects appear reversible after cessation of mitotane treatment and \ndecrease in plasma levels (see section 4.4).  \n\n\n\n 8 \n\n \nSkin rashes which have been reported in 5 to 25 % of patients do not seem to be dose related. \n \nLeucopoenia has been reported in 8 to 12 % of patients. Prolonged bleeding time appears a frequent \nfinding (90 %): although the exact mechanism of such an effect is unknown and its relation with \nmitotane or with the underlying disease is uncertain, it should be taken into account when surgery is \nconsidered. \n \nThe activity of liver enzymes (gamma-GT, aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase) is commonly \nincreased. Autoimmune hepatitis has been reported in 7 % of patients with no other information on \nmechanism. Liver enzymes levels normalize when the mitotane dose is decreased. A case of \ncholestatic hepatitis has been reported. Therefore, the possibility of mitotane-induced liver damage \ncannot be excluded. \n \nPremenopausal women  \nNon-malignant ovarian macrocysts (with symptoms such as pelvic pain, bleeding) have been \ndescribed. \n \nPaediatric population \nNeuro-psychological retardation may be observed during mitotane treatment. In such cases, thyroid \nfunction should be investigated in order to identify a possible thyroid impairment linked to mitotane \ntreatment. Hypothyroidism and growth retardation may be also observed. One case of encephalopathy \nhas been observed in a paediatric patient five months after initiation of the treatment; this case was \nconsidered to be related to an increased mitotane plasma level of 34.5 mg/L. After six months \nmitotane plasma levels were undetectable and the patient recovered clinically. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nMitotane overdose may lead to central nervous system impairment especially if mitotane plasma levels \nare above 20 mg/L. No proven antidotes have been established for mitotane overdose. The patient \nshould be followed closely, taking into account that impairment is reversible, but given the long \nhalf-life and the lipophilic nature of mitotane, it may take weeks to return to normal. Other effects \nshould be treated symptomatically. Because of its lipophilic nature, mitotane is not likely to be \ndialysable. \n \nIt is recommended to increase frequency of mitotane plasma level monitoring (e.g. every two weeks) \nin patients at risk of overdose (e.g. in case of renal or hepatic impairment, obese patients or patients \nwith a recent weight loss). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX23 \n \nMechanism of action \nMitotane is an adrenal cytotoxic active substance, although it can apparently also cause adrenal \ninhibition without cellular destruction. Its biochemical mechanism of action is unknown. Available \ndata suggest that mitotane modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids and that it also directly \nsuppresses the adrenal cortex. The administration of mitotane alters the extra-adrenal metabolism of \n\n\n\n 9 \n\ncortisol in humans, leading to a reduction in measurable 17-hydroxy corticosteroids, even though \nplasma levels of corticosteroids do not fall. Mitotane apparently causes increased formation of 6-beta-\nhydroxy cholesterol. \n \nClinical efficacy \nMitotane has not been studied in a comprehensive clinical development program. Available clinical \ninformation comes mainly from published data in patients with inoperable or metastatic adrenal \ncarcinoma. In terms of overall survival, four studies conclude that mitotane treatment does not \nincrease the survival rate whereas five find an increase in the survival rate. Among the latter, three \nstudies find such an increase only in patients in whom mitotane plasma is above 14 mg/L.  \n \nMitotane plasma levels and the possible relationship with its efficacy were studied in the FIRM ACT \ntrial, a randomized, prospective, controlled, open\u2013label, multicenter, parallel-group study to compare \nthe efficacy of etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin plus mitotane (EDP/M) to that of streptozotocin \nplus mitotane (Sz/M) as first-line treatment in 304 patients. The analysis of patients who achieved \nmitotane levels \u2265 14 mg/L at least once in 6 six months versus patients who mitotane levels were \n< 14 mg/L could suggest that patients with mitotane plasma levels \u2265 14 mg/L could have an \nimprovement in disease control rate (62.9% versus 33.5%; p< 0. 0001). However, this result should be \ncautiously taken since the examination of the mitotane effects was not the primary endpoint of the \nstudy. \n \nIn addition, mitotane induces a state of adrenal insufficiency which leads to the disappearance of \nCushing syndrome in patients with secreting adrenal carcinoma and necessitates substitution \nhormonotherapy. \n \nPaediatric population \nClinical information comes mainly from a prospective trial (n= 24 patients) in children and \nadolescents aged at diagnosis from 5 months to 16 years (median age: 4 years) who had an \nunresectable primary tumour or who presented a tumour recurrence or a metastasic disease; most of \nthe children (75%) presented with endocrine symptoms. Mitotane was given alone or combined with \nchemotherapy with various agents. Overall, the disease-free interval was 7 months (2 to 16 months). \nThere were recurrences in 40% of children; the survival rate at 5 years was 49%.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn a study performed in 8 patients with adrenal carcinoma treated with 2 to 3 g daily of mitotane, a \nhighly significant correlation was found between plasma mitotane concentration and the total mitotane \ndose. The target plasma mitotane concentration (14 mg/L) was reached in all patients within 3 to 5 \nmonths and the total mitotane dose ranged between 283 and 387 g (median value: 363 g). The \nthreshold of 20 mg/L was reached for cumulative amounts of mitotane of approximately 500 g. In \nanother study, 3 patients with adrenal carcinoma received Lysodren according to a precise protocol \nallowing fast introduction of a high dose if the product was well tolerated: 3 g (as 3 intakes) on day 1, \n4.5 g on day 2, 6 g on day 3, 7.5 g on day 4 and 9 g on day 5. This dose of Lysodren was continued or \ndecreased in function of side effects and plasma mitotane levels. There was a positive linear \ncorrelation between the cumulative dose of Lysodren and the plasma levels of mitotane. In two of the \n3 patients, plasma levels of more than 14 mg/L were achieved within 15 days and in one of them \nlevels above 20 mg/L were achieved within approximately 30 days. In addition, in both studies, in \nsome patients, the plasma mitotane levels continued to rise despite maintenance or a decrease of the \ndaily dose of mitotane.  \n \nDistribution \nAutopsy data from patients show that mitotane is found in most tissues of the body, with fat as the \nprimary site of storage. \n \nBiotransformation \nMetabolism studies in man have identified the corresponding acid, 1,1-(o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl) acetic \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nacid (o,p\u2019-DDA), as the major circulating metabolite, together with smaller quantities of the 1,1-(o,p'-\ndichlorodiphenyl)-2,2 dichloroethene (o,p\u2019-DDE) analogue of mitotane. No unchanged mitotane has \nbeen found in bile or in urine, where o,p\u2019-DDA predominates, together with several of its \nhydroxylated metabolites. For induction with cytochrome P450, see section 4.5. \n \nElimination \nAfter intravenous administration, 25% of the dose was excreted as metabolites within 24 hours. \nFollowing discontinuation of mitotane treatment, it is slowly released from storage sites in fat, leading \nto reported terminal plasma half-lives ranging from 18 to 159 days. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data on the general toxicity of mitotane is limited.  \n \nReproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with mitotane. However, \ndichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane (DDT) and other polychlorinated biphenyl analogues are known to \nhave deleterious effects on fertility, pregnancy and development, and mitotane could be expected to \nshare these properties.  \n \nThe genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of mitotane has not been investigated. \n \n \n6.
