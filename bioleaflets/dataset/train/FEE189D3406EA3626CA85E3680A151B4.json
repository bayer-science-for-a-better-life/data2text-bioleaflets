This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSARCLISA 20mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n One ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 20 mg of isatuximab. \n \nEach vial contains 100 mg of isatuximab in 5 mL of concentrate (100 mg/5mL). \nEach vial contains 500 mg of  isatuximab in 25 mL of concentrate (500 mg/25mL). \n \nIsatuximab is an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) produced from a \nmammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary, CHO). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \nColourless to slightly yellow solution, essentially free of visible particulates. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nSARCLISA is indicated, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, for the treatment of \nadult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two \nprior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and have demonstrated disease \nprogression on the last therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nSARCLISA should be administered by a healthcare professional, in an environment where \nresuscitation facilities are available. \n \nPremedication \nPremedication should be used prior to SARCLISA infusion with the following medicinal products to \nreduce the risk and severity of infusion reactions: \n\n \u2022 Dexamethasone 40 mg oral or intravenous (or 20 mg oral or intravenous for patients \u226575 years \nof age). \n\n\u2022 Acetaminophen 650 mg to 1000 mg oral (or equivalent). \n\n\u2022 H2 antagonists (ranitidine 50 mg intravenous or equivalent [e.g., cimetidine]), or oral proton \npump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, esomeprazole). \n\n\u2022 Diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg intravenous or oral (or equivalent [e.g., cetirizine, \npromethazine, dexchlorpheniramine]). The intravenous route is preferred for at least the first 4 \ninfusions. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe above recommended dose of dexamethasone (oral or intravenous) corresponds to the total dose to \nbe administered only once before the infusion, as part of the premedication and the backbone \ntreatment, before isatuximab and pomalidomide administration. \n \nThe recommended premedication agents should be administered 15-60 minutes prior to starting a \nSARCLISA infusion. Patients who do not experience an infusion reaction upon their first 4 \nadministrations of SARCLISA may have their need for subsequent premedication reconsidered. \n \nManagement of neutropenia \nThe use of colony-stimulating factors (e.g. G-CSF) should be considered to mitigate the risk of \nneutropenia. In the event of grade 4 neutropenia, SARCLISA administration should be delayed until \nneutrophil count improves to at least 1.0 x 109/L (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of SARCLISA is 10 mg/kg body weight administered as an intravenous \ninfusion in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (isatuximab regimen), according to \nthe schedule in the Table 1: \n\nTable 1: SARCLISA dosing schedule in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone \n \n\nCycles Dosing schedule \n\nCycle 1  Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (weekly) \n\nCycle 2 and beyond  Days 1, 15 (every 2 weeks) \n\n \nEach treatment cycle consists of a 28-day period. Treatment is repeated until disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity. \n\nFor other medicinal products that are administered with SARCLISA, refer to the respective current \nsummary of product characteristics. \n\nThe administration schedule must be carefully followed. If a planned dose of SARCLISA is missed, \nadminister the dose as soon as possible and adjust the treatment schedule accordingly, maintaining the \ntreatment interval. \n\nDose adjustments \nNo dose reduction of SARCLISA is recommended. \n \nAdministration adjustments should be made if patients experience infusion reactions (see \u201cMethod of \nadministration\u201d below). \n \nFor other medicinal products that are administered with SARCLISA, the respective current summary \nof product characteristics should be considered. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is recommended in elderly \npatients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis and on clinical safety, no dose adjustment is \nrecommended in patients with mild to severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nmild hepatic impairment. Data in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment are limited \n(see section 5.2), but there is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustment is required in these patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of SARCLISA in children below 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nSARCLISA is for intravenous use. For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before \nadministration, see section 6.6. \n \nInfusion rates \nFollowing dilution, the SARCLISA infusion should be administered intravenously at the infusion rate \npresented in the Table 2 below (see section 5.1). Incremental escalation of the infusion rate should be \nconsidered only in the absence of infusion reactions (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nTable 2: Infusion rates of SARCLISA administration \n \n\n Dilution \nvolume \n\nInitial rate \n \n\nAbsence of \ninfusion \nreaction \n\nRate increment Maximum \nrate \n\nFirst infusion 250 mL 25 mL/ hour For 60 minutes 25 mL/hour every \n30 minutes \n\n150 mL/ hour\n\nSecond \ninfusion \n\n250 mL 50 mL/ hour For 30 minutes 50 mL/ hour for \n30 minutes then \nincrease by 100 \nmL/ hr every 30 \nminutes \n\n200 mL/ hour\n\nSubsequent \ninfusions \n\n250 mL 200 mL/ hour   200 mL/ hour\n\n \nAdministration adjustments should be made if patients experience infusion reactions (see section 4.4) \n\n\uf0b7 In patients who experience Grade 2 (moderate) infusion reactions, a temporary interruption in \nthe infusion should be considered and additional symptomatic medicinal products can be \nadministered. After improvement to grade \u22641 (mild), SARCLISA infusion may be resumed at \nhalf of the initial infusion rate under close monitoring and supportive care, as needed. If \nsymptoms do not recur after 30 minutes, the infusion rate may be increased to the initial rate, \nand then increased incrementally, as shown in Table 2. \n\n\uf0b7 If symptoms do not resolve rapidly or do not improve to Grade \u22641 after interruption of \nSARCLISA infusion, recur after initial improvement with appropriate medicinal products, or \nrequire hospitalization or are life-threatening (Grade \u22653), treatment with SARCLISA should \nbe permanently discontinued and additional supportive therapy should be administered, as \nneeded. \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of its excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nInfusion reactions \nInfusion reactions, mostly mild or moderate, have been observed in 38.2% of patients treated with \nSARCLISA (see section 4.8). All infusion reactions started during the first SARCLISA infusion and \nresolved on the same day in 98% of the infusions. The most common symptoms of an infusion \nreaction included dyspnoea, cough, chills and nausea. The most common severe signs and symptoms \nincluded hypertension and dyspnoea (see section 4.8). \n \nTo decrease the risk and severity of infusion reactions, patients should be pre-medicated prior to \nSARCLISA infusion with acetaminophen, H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors, diphenhydramine \nor equivalent; dexamethasone is to be used as both premedication and anti-myeloma treatment (see \nsection 4.2). Vital signs should be frequently monitored during the entire SARCLISA infusion. When \nrequired, interrupt SARCLISA infusion and provide appropriate medical and supportive measures (see \nsection 4.2). In case symptoms do not improve after interruption of SARCLISA infusion, recur after \ninitial improvement with appropriate medicinal products, require hospitalization or are life-\nthreatening, permanently discontinue SARCLISA and institute appropriate management. \n \nNeutropenia \nGrade 3-4 neutropenia reported as laboratory abnormalities (84.9%) and neutropenic complications \n(30.3%) have been observed in patients treated with SARCLISA (see section 4.8).  \nComplete blood cell counts should be monitored periodically during treatment. Patients with \nneutropenia should be monitored for signs of infection. No dose reductions of SARCLISA are \nrecommended. SARCLISA dose delays and the use of colony-stimulating factors (e.g. G-CSF) should \nbe considered to mitigate the risk of neutropenia (see section 4.2). \n \nInfection \nA higher incidence of infections including grade \u2265 3 infections, mainly pneumonia, upper respiratory \ntract infection and bronchitis, occurred with SARCLISA (see section 4.8). Patients receiving \nSARCLISA should be closely monitored for signs of infection and appropriate standard therapy \ninstituted. Antibiotics, antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis can be considered during treatment. \n \nSecond primary malignancies \nIn ICARIA-MM study, second primary malignancies (SPMs) were reported in 6 patients (3.9%) \ntreated with SARCLISA and in 1 patient (0.7%) treated with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, and \nincluded skin squamous cell carcinoma in 4 patients treated with SARCLISA and in 1 patient treated \nwith pomalidomide and dexamethasone (see section 4.8). Patients continued treatment after resection \nof the skin squamous cell carcinoma. The overall incidence of SPMs in all the SARCLISA-exposed \npatients is 3%. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during treatment as per IMWG \nguidelines for occurrence of SPM and initiate treatment as indicated. \n \nInterference with serological testing (indirect antiglobulin test) \nIsatuximab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and may result in a false positive indirect \nantiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test). To avoid potential problems with RBC transfusion, patients \nbeing treated with SARCLISA should have blood type and screen tests performed prior to the first \ninfusion. Phenotyping may be considered prior to starting SARCLISA treatment as per local practice. \nIf treatment with SARCLISA has already started, the blood bank should be informed. Patients should \nbe monitored for theoretical risk of haemolysis. If an emergency transfusion is required, \nnon- cross- matched ABO/Rh-compatible RBCs can be given as per local blood bank practices (see \nsection 4.5). There is currently no available information with regards to how long the interference with \nthe indirect Coombs test may persist after the last infusion of SARCLISA. Based on the half-life of \nisatuximab, it is anticipated that isatuximab mediated positive indirect Coombs test may persist for \napproximately 6 months after the last infusion. \n \nInterference with determination of complete response \nIsatuximab is an IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that could be detected on both serum protein \nelectrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of \nendogenous M-protein (see section 4.5). This interference can impact the accuracy of the \ndetermination of complete response in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. Twenty-two \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\npatients in the isatuximab regimen arm who met Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) criteria with \nonly residual immunofixation-positivity were tested for interference. Serum samples from these \npatients were tested by mass spectrometry to separate isatuximab signal from the myeloma M-protein \nsignal. (see section 4.5). \n \nElderly \nData are limited in the elderly population \u2265 85 years old (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIsatuximab has no impact on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide and vice versa. \n \nInterference with serological testing \nBecause CD38 protein is expressed on the surface of red blood cells, isatuximab, an anti-CD38 \nantibody, may interfere with blood bank serologic tests with potential false positive reactions in \nindirect antiglobulin tests (indirect Coombs tests), antibody detection (screening) tests, antibody \nidentification panels, and antihuman globulin (AHG) crossmatches in patients treated with isatuximab \n(see section 4.4). The interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with \ndithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt isatuximab binding or other locally validated methods. Since the Kell \nBlood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, Kell-negative units should be supplied after \nruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs. \n \nInterference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests \nIsatuximab may be detected by serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays \nused for the monitoring of M-protein, and could interfere with accurate response classification based \non International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria (see section 4.4). \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \nWomen of childbearing potential treated with isatuximab should use effective contraception during \ntreatment and for 5 months after cessation of treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no available data on  isatuximab use in pregnant women. Animal reproduction toxicity \nstudies have not been conducted with  isatuximab. Immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibodies are \nknown to cross the placenta after the first trimester of pregnancy. The use of isatuximab in pregnant \nwomen is not recommended.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether isatuximab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in \nbreast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon \nafterwards; however, a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short period just \nafter birth. For this specific period, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or \nto discontinue/abstain from isatuximab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Afterwards, isatuximab  could be used during breast-\nfeeding if clinically needed. \n \nFertility \nNo human and animal data are available to determine potential effects of isatuximab on fertility in \nmales and females (see section 5.3). \n \nFor other medicinal products that are administered with isatuximab, refer to the respective current \nsummary of product characteristics. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nSARCLISA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequent adverse reactions (>20%) are neutropenia (46.7%), infusion reactions (38.2%), \npneumonia (30.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (28.3%), diarrhoea (25.7%) and bronchitis \n(23.7%). \n \nThe most frequent serious adverse reactions are pneumonia (9.9%) and febrile neutropenia (6.6%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse  reactions are described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, the COSTART and the \nMedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \nThe adverse reactions were selected based on an incidence of \u2265 5% (all grades) or \u2265 2% (grades \u22653) of \npatients treated with isatuximab regimen group and based on the incidence rate being \u2265 5% greater in \nthe isatuximab regimen group compared to the comparator regimen (pomalidomide and low-dose \ndexamethasone) group. The terms atrial fibrillation and skin squamous cell carcinoma were added \nbecause of their clinical relevance. \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nTable 3a: Adverse reactions reported in patients with multiple myeloma treated with isatuximab \nin combination with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (ICARIA-MM study) \n \nSystem Organ Class \n\nPreferred Term  \nAdverse reaction Frequency Incidence (%) \n\n(N=152) \nAny Grade Grade \u22653 \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nPneumoniab Very common 47 (30.9) 40 (26.3) \n\nUpper respiratory tract \ninfection* \n\nVery common \n43 (28.3) 5 (3.3) \n\nBronchitis* Very common 36 (23.7) 5 (3.3)        \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified (incl cysts \nand polyps) \n\nSkin squamous cell \ncarcinoma \n\nCommon \n\n4 (2.6) 2 (1.3) \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropeniac Very common 71 (46.7) 70 (46.1) \n\nFebrile neutropenia Very common 18 (11.8) 18 (11.8) \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nDecreased appetite* Common   15 (9.9) 2 (1.3) \n\nCardiac disorders Atrial fibrillation Common 7 (4.6) 3 (2.0) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea* Very common \n23 (15.1) 6 (3.9) \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea* Very common 39 (25.7) 3 (2.0) \n\nNausea* Very common 23 (15.1) 0 \n\nVomiting* Very common 18 (11.8) 2 (1.3) \n\nInvestigations Weight decreased* Common 10 (6.6) 0 \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\nInfusion reaction \n \n\nVery common 58 (38.2) 4 (2.6) \n\na Only TEAEs are reported in the Table 3.

All \npatients who experienced infusion reactions, experienced them during the 1st infusion of SARCLISA, \nwith 3 patients (2.0%) also having infusion reactions at their 2nd infusion, and 2 patients (1.3%) at \ntheir 4th infusion.  Grade 1 infusion reactions were reported in 3.9%, Grade 2 in 31.6%, Grade 3 in \n1.3%, and Grade 4 in 1.3% of the patients. All infusion reactions were reversible and resolved the \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nsame day in 98% of the infusions. Signs and symptoms of Grade 3 or higher infusion reactions \nincluded dyspnoea, hypertension and bronchospasm. \nThe incidence of infusion interruptions because of infusion reactions was 28.9%.  The median time to \ninfusion interruption was 55 minutes. \nDiscontinuations from treatment due to infusion reaction were reported in 2.6% of patients in \nisatuximab regimen group. \n \nInfections \nIn ICARIA-MM, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher infections was 42.8%.  Pneumonia was the most \ncommonly reported severe infection with Grade 3 reported in 21.7% of patients in isatuximab regimen \ngroup compared to 16.1% in comparator regimen (pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone) group, \nand Grade 4 in 3.3% of patients in isatuximab regimen group compared to 2.7% in comparator regimen \ngroup. Discontinuations from treatment due to infection were reported in 2.6% of patients in isatuximab \nregimen group compared to 5.4% in comparator regimen group. Fatal infections were reported in 3.3% \nof patients in isatuximab regimen group and 4.0% in comparator regimen group. \n \nHaematology laboratory values \n \nTable 4: Haematology laboratory abnormalities in patients receiving isatuximab combined with \npomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone\u2013versus pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone \n(ICARIA-MM) \n \nLaboratory \nparameter \n\nSARCLISA + Pomalidomide + low-\ndose Dexamethasone \nn(%) \n(N=152) \n\nPomalidomide + low-dose \nDexamethasone \nn(%) \n(N=147) \n\n All grades Grade 3 Grade 4 All grades Grade 3 Grade 4 \nAnemia 151 (99.3) 48 (31.6) 0 145 (98.6) 41 (27.9) 0 \nNeutropenia 146 (96.1) 37 (24.3) 92 (60.5) 137 (93.2) 57 (38.8) 46 (31.3) \nLymphopenia 140 (92.1) 64 (42.1) 19 (12.5) 137 (93.2) 52 (35.4) 12 (8.2) \nThrombocytopenia 127 (83.6) 22 (14.5) 25 (16.4) 118 (80.3) 14 (9.5) 22 (15.0) \nThe denominator used for the percentage calculation is the number of patients with at least 1 \nevaluation of the laboratory test during the considered observation period. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAcross 6 clinical studies in multiple myeloma (MM) with isatuximab single agent and combination \ntherapies including ICARIA-MM (N=564), the incidence of treatment emergent ADAs was 2.3%. No \neffect of ADAs was observed on pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy of isatuximab. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \nThere has been no experience of overdosage in clinical studies. Doses of intravenous isatuximab up to \n20 mg/kg have been administered in clinical studies. \n \nManagement \nThere is no known specific antidote for SARCLISA overdose. In the event of overdose, monitor the \npatients for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and take all appropriate measures immediately. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC38. \n \nMechanism of action \nIsatuximab is an IgG1-derived monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific extracellular epitope of \nCD38 receptor. CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed on multiple myeloma \ncells. \n\nIn vitro, isatuximab acts through IgG Fc-dependent mechanisms including: antibody dependent cell \nmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement \ndependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Furthermore, isatuximab can also trigger tumor cell death by induction \nof apoptosis via an Fc-independent mechanism. \n\nIn vitro, isatuximab blocks the enzymatic activity of CD38 which catalyzes the synthesis and \nhydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a calcium mobilizing agent. Isatuximab inhibits the \ncADPR production from extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in multiple myeloma \ncells. \n \nIn vitro, isatuximab can activate NK cells in the absence of CD38 positive target tumour cells. \nIn vivo, a decrease in absolute counts of total CD16+ and CD56+ NK cells, CD19+ B-cells, CD4+ T-\ncells and TREG (CD3+, CD4+, CD25+, CD127-) was observed in peripheral blood of patients treated \nwith isatuximab monotherapy. \n \nIn multiple myeloma patients, SARCLISA monotherapy induced clonal expansion of the T-cell \nreceptor repertoire indicating an adaptive immune response. \n \nThe combination of isatuximab and pomalidomide in vitro enhances cell lysis of CD38 expressing \nmultiple myeloma cells by effector cells (ADCC), and by direct tumour cell killing compared to that \nof isatuximab alone.  In vivo animal experiments using a human multiple myeloma xenograft model in \nmice demonstrated that the combination of isatuximab and pomalidomide results in enhanced \nantitumour activity compared to the activity of isatuximab or pomalidomide alone. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nICARIA-MM (EFC14335) \n \nThe efficacy and safety of SARCLISA in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose \ndexamethasone were evaluated in ICARIA-MM (EFC14335), a multicenter, multinational, \nrandomised, open-label, 2-arm, phase III study in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple \nmyeloma. Patients had received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome \ninhibitor with disease progression on or within 60 days after the end of the previous therapy. Patients \nwith primary refractory disease were excluded. \n \nA total of 307 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SARCLISA in combination \nwith pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (isatuximab regimen, 154 patients) or pomalidomide \nand low-dose dexamethasone (comparator regimen, 153 patients). Treatment was administered in both \ngroups in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SARCLISA 10 mg/kg was \nadministered as an I.V. infusion weekly in the first cycle and every two weeks thereafter. \nPomalidomide 4 mg was taken orally once daily from day 1 to day 21 of each 28-day cycle. Low-dose \ndexamethasone (oral/intravenous) 40 mg (20 mg for patients \u226575 years of age) was given on days 1, 8, \n15 and 22 for each 28-day cycle. \n \nOverall, demographic and disease characteristics at baseline were similar between the two treatment \ngroups, with some minor imbalances. The median patient age was 67 years (range 36-86), 19.9% of \npatients were \u226575 years.

The \nfixed volume infusion method as described in section 4.2 was evaluated in study TCD14079 Part B \nand pharmacokinetics simulations confirmed minimal differences between the pharmacokinetics \nfollowing injection applying a volume based on patient weight and a fixed volume of 250 mL (see \nsection 5.2). In study TCD14079 part B, there were no new safety signals or differences in efficacy as \ncompared to the ICARIA-MM study. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSARCLISA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant \nneoplasms of the haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of isatuximab were assessed in 476 patients with multiple myeloma treated with \nisatuximab intravenous infusion as a single agent or in combination with pomalidomide and \ndexamethasone, at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg, administered either once weekly; every 2 weeks; \nor every 2 weeks for 8 weeks followed by every 4 weeks; or every week for 4 weeks followed by \nevery 2 weeks. \n \nIsatuximab displays nonlinear pharmacokinetics with target-mediated drug disposition due to its \nbinding to CD38 receptor. \nIsatuximab exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the dosing interval AUC) \nincreases in a greater than dose proportional manner from 1 to 20 mg/kg following every 2 weeks \nschedule, while no deviation to the dose proportionality is observed between 5 and 20 mg/kg \nfollowing every week for 4 weeks followed by every 2 weeks schedule. This is due to the high \ncontribution of nonlinear target-mediated clearance to the total clearance at doses below 5 mg/kg, \nwhich becomes negligible at higher doses. After isatuximab 10 mg/kg administration every week for 4 \nweeks followed by every 2 weeks, the median time to reach steady state was 8 weeks with a 3.1-fold \naccumulation. The mean (CV%) predicted maximum plasma concentration Cmax and AUC at steady \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nstate were 351 \u00b5g/mL (36.0%) and 72,600 \u00b5g.h/mL (51.7%), respectively. Although the change from \na weight-based volume administration method for isatuximab infusion to the fixed volume infusion \nmethod resulted in changes in the tmax, the change had a limited impact on pharmacokinetics exposure \nwith comparable simulated Cmax at steady state (283 \u00b5g/mL vs 284 \u00b5g/mL) and Ctrough at 4 \nweeks (119 \u00b5g/mL vs 119 \u00b5g/mL) for a patient with median weight (76 kg). Also for other patient \nweight groups, Cmax and Ctrough were comparable. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of isatuximab and pomalidomide were not influenced by their \nco-administration. \n \nDistribution \nThe estimated total volume of distribution of isatuximab is 8.75 L. \n \nMetabolism \nAs a large protein, isatuximab is expected to be metabolized by non-saturable proteolytic catabolism \nprocesses. \n \nElimination \nIsatuximab is eliminated by two parallel pathways, a nonlinear target-mediated pathway \npredominating at low concentrations, and a nonspecific linear pathway predominating at higher \nconcentrations. In the therapeutic plasma concentrations range, the linear pathway is predominant and \ndecreases over time by 50% to a steady state value of 9.55 mL/h (0.229 L/day). This is associated with \na terminal half-life of 28 days. \n \nSpecific populations \n \nAge  \nThe population pharmacokinetic analyses of 476 patients aged 36 to 85 years showed comparable \nexposure to isatuximab in patients <75 years old (n=406) versus \u2265 75 years old (n=70). \n \nGender \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis with 207 female (43.5%) and 269 male (56.5%) patients \nshowed no clinically meaningful effect of gender on isatuximab pharmacokinetics. \n \nRace \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis with 377 Caucasian (79%), 25 Asian (5%), 18 Black (4%), \nand 33 other race (7%) patients showed no clinically meaningful effect of race on isatuximab \npharmacokinetics. \n \nWeight \nIsatuximab exposure (AUC) at steady state decreased with increasing body weight. \n \nHepatic Impairment \nNo formal studies of isatuximab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Out of the \n476 patients of the population pharmacokinetic analyses, 65 patients presented with mild hepatic \nimpairment [total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or aspartate amino transferase \n(AST) > ULN] and 1 patient had moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin> 1.5 to 3 times ULN \nand any AST). Mild hepatic impairment had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof isatuximab. The effect of moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 times to 3 times ULN and any AST) and \nsevere hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST) on isatuximab \npharmacokinetics is unknown. However, since isatuximab is a monoclonal antibody, it is not expected \nto be cleared via hepatic-enzyme mediated metabolism and as such, variation in hepatic function is not \nexpected to affect the elimination of isatuximab (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal Impairment \nNo formal studies of isatuximab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. The \npopulation pharmacokinetic analyses on 476 patients included 192 patients with mild renal impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n(60 mL/min/1.73 m2 \u2264 estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m2), 163 patients \nwith moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min/1.73 m2\u2264 e-GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 12 patients \nwith severe renal impairment (e-GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Analyses suggested no clinically \nmeaningful effect of mild to severe renal impairment on isatuximab pharmacokinetics compared to \nnormal renal function. \n \nPaediatric population \nIsatuximab was not evaluated in patients under 18 years of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity, albeit the species selected is not pharmacologically responsive and therefore the relevance for \nhumans is not known. Genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and \ndevelopment studies have not been performed. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist,  or nurse. \n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What you need to know before you are given Sarclisa \n3. How Sarclisa is used \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Sarclisa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Sarclisa is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Sarclisa is \nSarclisa is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance isatuximab. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d.  \nMonoclonal antibodies, such as Sarclisa, are proteins that have been designed to recognise and attach \nthemselves to a target substance. In the case of Sarclisa, the target is a substance called CD38 that is \nfound on cells of multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. By attaching to multiple myeloma \ncells, the medicine helps your immune system (the natural defences of your body) identify and destroy \nthem. \n \nWhat is Sarclisa used for \nSarclisa is used to treat multiple myeloma in patients who have had at least 2 treatments for multiple \nmyeloma before. \nIt is used together with two other medicines called pomalidomide and dexamethasone. \n \nIf you have any questions on how Sarclisa works or about your treatment with Sarclisa, ask your \ndoctor. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Sarclisa \n \nYou must not be given Sarclisa if: \n\uf0b7 you are allergic to isatuximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using Sarclisa and follow all instructions carefully. \n \nInfusion reactions \nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infusion reactions during or after the \ninfusion of Sarclisa - see in section 4 for the list of signs of \u2018Infusion reactions\u2019. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n\uf0b7 Before starting a Sarclisa infusion, you may be given medicines to reduce infusion reactions (see \nsection 3). \n\n\uf0b7 Infusion reactions can happen during the Sarclisa infusion or after the infusion. These reactions \nare reversible. The hospital staff will monitor you closely during treatment. \n\nIf you get an infusion reaction, your doctor or nurse may give you additional medicines to treat your \nsymptoms and prevent complications, or temporarily stop, slow down, or completely stop the Sarclisa \ninfusion. \n \nFever and low number of white blood cells \nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you develop fever, as it may be a sign of infection. Sarclisa \ncan lower the number of white blood cells - which are important for fighting infections.  \n \nBlood transfusion \nIf you need a blood transfusion, you will have a blood test first to match your blood type. \n  \nTell the person doing the blood test that you are being treated with Sarclisa, as it can affect the results \nof this blood test. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nSarclisa is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged under 18 years. This is because \nthis medicine has not been tested in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Sarclisa \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines you can get without a prescription, and herbal medicines. \n \n Sarclisa is used with other medicines when treating multiple myeloma. For information on these \nmedicines, see their package leaflets. \n \nPregnancy \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before using Sarclisa.  \nUse of Sarclisais not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or planning to become \npregnant, talk to your doctor about using Sarclisa. \n \nFor information on pregnancy and other medicines that are taken with Sarclisa, please look at the \npackage leaflet for these other medicines. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before using Sarclisa. \n\uf0b7 This is because Sarclisa may pass into breast milk.  It is not known how it could affect the baby.\u00a0\n\uf0b7 You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breastfeeding is greater than the risk to your \n\nbaby.\u00a0\n\nContraception \nWomen who are using Sarclisa and are able to become pregnant must use an effective method of \ncontraception. Talk to your doctor about the method of contraception that you must use during this \ntime. Use contraception during treatment - and for 5 months after the last dose of Sarclisa. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nSarclisa is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  However, Isatuximab is used with \nother medicines that may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Please look at the package \nleaflet from the other medicines you take with isatuximab.  \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n3.

If you miss any appointments, call your doctor or nurse as soon as \npossible to reschedule the appointment. \n \nYour doctor or nurse will decide how your treatment should be continued. \n \nIf you are given more Sarclisa than you should \nSarclisa will be given to you by your doctor or nurse. If you are accidentally given too much (an \noverdose), your doctor will treat and monitor your side effects. \n \nIf you stop using Sarclisa  \nDo not stop your treatment with Sarclisa unless you have discussed that with your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

The infusion solution must be prepared under aseptic \nconditions, and administered by a healthcare professional in an environment where resuscitation \nfacilities are available. \n\n Preparation and administration of SARCLISA \n \n\n\uf0b7 Calculate the dose (mg) of required SARCLISA concentrate, and determine the number of \nvials needed for the 10 mg/kg dose, based on the patient weight. More than one vial may be \nneeded. \n\n\uf0b7 Visually check the SARCLISA concentrate before dilution to ensure it does not contain any \nparticles and is not discoloured. \n\n\uf0b7 Remove the volume of diluent equal to the required volume of SARCLISA concentrate from a \n250 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 5% solution \ndiluent bag.  \n\n\uf0b7 Withdraw the appropriate volume of SARCLISA concentrate and dilute it in the 250 mL \ninfusion bag with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 5% \nsolution.   \nThe infusion bag must be made of polyolefins (PO), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), \npolyvinyl chloride (PVC) with di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) or ethyl vinyl acetate \n(EVA). \n\n\uf0b7 Gently invert the bag to homogenize the diluted solution. Do not shake. \n\uf0b7 Administer the infusion solution intravenously using an intravenous tubing infusion set (in PE, \n\nPVC with or without DEHP, polybudadiene (PBD) or polyurethane (PU)) with an in-line filter \n(polyethersulfone (PES), polysulfone or nylon). \n\n\uf0b7 Administer the infusion solution for a period of time that will depend on the infusion rate (see \nEU-SmPC section 4.2). \n\n\uf0b7 Use the prepared SARCLISA infusion solution immediately. If not used immediately, in-use \nstorage times and conditions prior use are the responsibility of the user and should normally \nnot be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and \nvalidated aseptic conditions. \n\n\uf0b7 No protection from light is required for the prepared infusion bag in a standard artificial light \nenvironment. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not infuse SARCLISA solution concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other \nagents. \n\n\uf0b7 Discard all unused portions of solution. All materials that have been utilised for dilution and \nadministration should be disposed of according to standard procedures. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tANNEX ISUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
