NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSaxenda 6 mg/ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml of solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide*. One pre-filled pen contains 18 mg liraglutide in 3 ml. \n \n*human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue produced by recombinant DNA technology in \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear and colourless or almost colourless, isotonic solution; pH=8.15. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSaxenda is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight \nmanagement in adult patients with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of  \n\u2022 \u226530 kg/m\u00b2 (obese), or \n\u2022 \u226527 kg/m\u00b2 to <30 kg/m\u00b2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity \n\nsuch as dysglycaemia (pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus), hypertension, dyslipidaemia or \nobstructive sleep apnoea. \n\n \nTreatment with Saxenda should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose if patients \nhave not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe starting dose is 0.6 mg once daily. The dose should be increased to 3.0 mg once daily in \nincrements of 0.6 mg with at least one week intervals to improve gastro-intestinal tolerability (see \ntable 1). If escalation to the next dose step is not tolerated for two consecutive weeks, consider \ndiscontinuing treatment. Daily doses higher than 3.0 mg are not recommended. \n \nTable 1 Dose escalation schedule \n\n Dose Weeks \n\nDose escalation \n4 weeks \n\n0.6 mg 1 \n1.2 mg 1 \n1.8 mg 1 \n2.4 mg 1 \n\nMaintenance dose 3.0 mg \n \nMissed doses \n \nIf a dose is missed within 12 hours from when it is usually taken, the patient should take the dose as \nsoon as possible. If there is less than 12 hours to the next dose, the patient should not take the missed \n\n\n\n3 \n\ndose and resume the once-daily regimen with the next scheduled dose. An extra dose or increase in \ndose should not be taken to make up for the missed dose.  \n \nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  \n \nSaxenda should not be used in combination with another GLP-1 receptor agonist.  \n \nWhen initiating Saxenda, it should be considered to reduce the dose of concomitantly administered \ninsulin or insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Blood \nglucose self-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of insulin or insulin-secretagogues (see section \n4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (\u226565 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients \u226575 years of age is \nlimited and use in these patients is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance \u226530 ml/min). Saxenda is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) including patients with end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 \nand 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment  \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Saxenda \nis not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used cautiously \nin patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Saxenda in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSaxenda is for subcutaneous use only. It must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. \n \nSaxenda is administered once daily at any time, independent of meals. It should be injected in the \nabdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment. \nHowever, it is preferable that Saxenda is injected around the same time of the day, when the most \nconvenient time of the day has been chosen. \n \nFor further instructions on administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to liraglutide or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nPatients with heart failure \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nThere is no clinical experience in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart Association \n(NYHA) class IV, and liraglutide is therefore not recommended for use in these patients. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe safety and efficacy of liraglutide for weight management have not been established in patients: \n\u2013 aged 75 years or more, \n\u2013 treated with other products for weight management, \n\u2013 with obesity secondary to endocrinological or eating disorders or to treatment with medicinal \n\nproducts that may cause weight gain, \n\u2013 with severe renal impairment, \n\u2013 with severe hepatic impairment. \nUse in these patients is not recommended (see section 4.2). \nAs liraglutide for weight management was not investigated in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment, it should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nThere is limited experience in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and diabetic gastroparesis. \nUse of liraglutide is not recommended in these patients since it is associated with transient \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. \n \nPancreatitis \n \nAcute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients should be \ninformed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide \nshould be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide should not be restarted.  \n \nCholelithiasis and cholecystitis \n \nIn clinical trials for weight management, a higher rate of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis was observed \nin patients treated with liraglutide than in patients on placebo. The fact that substantial weight loss can \nincrease the risk of cholelithiasis and thereby cholecystitis only partially explained the higher rate with \nliraglutide. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis may lead to hospitalisation and cholecystectomy. Patients \nshould be informed of the characteristic symptoms of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. \n \nThyroid disease \n \nIn clinical trials in type 2 diabetes, thyroid adverse events, such as goitre, have been reported in \nparticular in patients with pre-existing thyroid disease. Liraglutide should therefore be used with \ncaution in patients with thyroid disease. \n \nHeart rate \n \nAn increase in heart rate was observed with liraglutide in clinical trials (see section 5.1). Heart rate \nshould be monitored at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. Patients should be \ninformed of the symptoms of increased heart rate (palpitations or feelings of a racing heartbeat while \nat rest). For patients who experience a clinically relevant sustained increase in resting heart rate, \ntreatment with liraglutide should be discontinued. \n \nDehydration \n \nSigns and symptoms of dehydration, including renal impairment and acute renal failure, have been \nreported in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients treated with liraglutide should be \nadvised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to gastrointestinal side effects and take \nprecautions to avoid fluid depletion. \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving liraglutide in combination with insulin and/or \nsulfonylurea may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may be \nlowered by a reduction in the dose of insulin and/or sulfonylurea. \n \nHyperglycaemia in insulin treated patients with diabetes mellitus  \n \nIn patients with diabetes mellitus Saxenda must not be used as a substitute for insulin. Diabetic \nketoacidosis has been reported in insulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose \nreduction of insulin (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nSaxenda contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, therefore the medicinal product is \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro, liraglutide has shown very low potential to be involved in pharmacokinetic interactions with \nother active substances related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. \n \nThe small delay of gastric emptying with liraglutide may influence absorption of concomitantly \nadministered oral medicinal products. Interaction studies did not show any clinically relevant delay of \nabsorption and therefore no dose adjustment is required. \n \nInteraction studies have been performed with 1.8 mg liraglutide. The effect on rate of gastric emptying \nwas equivalent between liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3.0 mg, (paracetamol AUC0-300 min). Few patients \ntreated with liraglutide reported at least one episode of severe diarrhoea. Diarrhoea may affect the \nabsorption of concomitant oral medicinal products.  \n \nWarfarin and other coumarin derivatives \n \nNo interaction study has been performed. A clinically relevant interaction with active substances with \npoor solubility or narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin cannot be excluded. Upon initiation of \nliraglutide treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, more frequent monitoring \nof International Normalised Ratio (INR) is recommended. \n \nParacetamol (Acetaminophen) \n \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of paracetamol following a single dose of 1,000 mg. \nParacetamol Cmax was decreased by 31% and median tmax was delayed up to 15 min. No dose \nadjustment for concomitant use of paracetamol is required. \n \nAtorvastatin \n \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin following single dose administration of \natorvastatin 40 mg. Therefore, no dose adjustment of atorvastatin is required when given with \nliraglutide. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with \nliraglutide. \n \nGriseofulvin \n \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of griseofulvin following administration of a single \ndose of griseofulvin 500 mg. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median tmax did not change. \nDose adjustments of griseofulvin and other compounds with low solubility and high permeability are \nnot required. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nDigoxin  \n \nA single dose administration of digoxin 1 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC \nby 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median tmax was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. No dose \nadjustment of digoxin is required based on these results.  \n \nLisinopril  \n \nA single dose administration of lisinopril 20 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril \nAUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with \nliraglutide. No dose adjustment of lisinopril is required based on these results. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nLiraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following \nadministration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. tmax was delayed by 1.5 h with \nliraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of \neither ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be \nunaffected when co-administered with liraglutide. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of liraglutide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nLiraglutide should not be used during pregnancy. If a patient wishes to become pregnant or pregnancy \noccurs, treatment with liraglutide should be discontinued. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether liraglutide is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that the \ntransfer of liraglutide and metabolites of close structural relationship into milk is low. Non-clinical \nstudies have shown a treatment-related reduction of neonatal growth in suckling rat pups (see section \n5.3). Because of lack of experience, Saxenda should not be used during breast-feeding.  \n \nFertility \n \nApart from a slight decrease in the number of live implants, animal studies did not indicate harmful \neffects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSaxenda has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness \ncan be experienced mainly during the first 3 months of treatment with Saxenda. Driving or use of \nmachines should be exercised with caution if dizziness occurs. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile:  \n \nSaxenda was evaluated for safety in 5 double-blind, placebo controlled trials that enrolled 5,813 obese \npatients or overweight patients with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Overall, gastrointestinal \nreactions were the most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment (67.9%) (see section \n\u2018Description of selected adverse reactions\u2019). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 2 lists adverse reactions reported. Adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and \nfrequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2 Adverse reactions reported \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Anaphylactic \nreaction \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Hypoglycaemia* Dehydration  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia**   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Dizziness \nDysgeusia \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders   Tachycardia  \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea \nVomiting \nDiarrhoea \nConstipation \n\nDry mouth \nDyspepsia \nGastritis \nGastro-oesophageal \nreflux disease \nAbdominal pain \nupper \nFlatulence \nEructation \nAbdominal \ndistension \n\nPancreatitis*** \nDelayed gastric \nemptying**** \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders  \n\n Cholelithiasis*** Cholecystitis***  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Urticaria  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n   Acute renal \nfailure \nRenal \nimpairment \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\n Injection site \nreactions  \nAsthenia \nFatigue \n\nMalaise  \n\nInvestigations  Increased lipase \nIncreased amylase \n\n  \n\n*Hypoglycaemia (based on self-reported symptoms by patients and not confirmed by blood glucose \nmeasurements) reported in patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with Saxenda in \ncombination with diet and exercise. Please see section \u2018Description of selected adverse reactions\u2019 for \nfurther information. \n**Insomnia was mainly seen during the first 3 months of treatment. \n***See section 4.4. \n****From controlled phase 2, 3a and 3b clinical trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions:  \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nIn clinical trials in overweight or obese patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with Saxenda \nin combination with diet and exercise, no severe hypoglycaemic events (requiring third party \nassistance) were reported. Symptoms of hypoglycaemic events were reported by 1.6 % of patients \ntreated with Saxenda and 1.1% of patients treated with placebo; however, these events were not \nconfirmed by blood glucose measurements. The majority of events were mild. \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \n \nIn a clinical trial in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with Saxenda in \ncombination with diet and exercise, severe hypoglycaemia (requiring third party assistance) was \nreported by 0.7% of patients treated with Saxenda and only in patients concomitantly treated with \nsulfonylurea. Also, in these patients documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia was reported by 43.6% \nof patients treated with Saxenda and in 27.3% of patients treated with placebo. Among patients not \nconcomitantly treated with sulfonylurea, 15.7% of patients treated with Saxenda and 7.6% of patients \ntreated with placebo reported documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events (defined as plasma \nglucose \u22643.9 mmol/L accompanied by symptoms).  \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin \n \nIn a clinical trial in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and \nliraglutide 3.0 mg/day in combination with diet and exercise and up to 2 OADs, severe hypoglycaemia \n(requiring third party assistance) was reported by 1.5% of patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day. \nIn this trial, documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (defined as plasma glucose \u22643.9 mmol/L \naccompanied by symptoms) was reported by 47.2% of patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and \nby 51.8% of patients treated with placebo. Among patients concomitantly treated with sulfonylurea, \n60.9% of patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and 60.0% of patients treated with placebo \nreported documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events.  \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \n \nMost episodes of gastrointestinal events were mild to moderate, transient and the majority did not lead \nto discontinuation of therapy. The reactions usually occurred during the first weeks of treatment and \ndiminished within a few days or weeks on continued treatment. \n \nPatients \u226565 years of age may experience more gastrointestinal effects when treated with Saxenda.  \n \nPatients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u226530 ml/min) may experience \nmore gastrointestinal effects when treated with Saxenda. \n \nAcute renal failure \n \nIn patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been reports of acute renal failure. A \nmajority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting or \ndiarrhoea leading to volume depletion (see section 4.4). \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nFew cases of anaphylactic reactions with symptoms such as hypotension, palpitations, dyspnoea and \noedema have been reported with marketed use of liraglutide. Anaphylactic reactions may potentially \nbe life threatening. If an anaphylactic reaction is suspected, liraglutide should be discontinued and \ntreatment should not be restarted (see section 4.3). \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nInjection site reactions have been reported in patients treated with Saxenda. These reactions were \nusually mild and transitory and the majority disappeared during continued treatment. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTachycardia \n \nIn clinical trials, tachycardia was reported in 0.6% of patients treated with Saxenda and in 0.1% of \npatients treated with placebo. The majority of events were mild or moderate. Events were isolated and \nthe majority resolved during continued treatment with Saxenda. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSaxenda is not recommended for use in paediatric patients. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most \nfrequently reported adverse events in two dose escalation studies completed so far.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nFrom clinical trials and post-marketing use of liraglutide overdoses have been reported up to 72 mg \n(24 times the recommended dose for weight management). Events reported included severe nausea \nand severe vomiting which are also the expected symptoms of an overdose with liraglutide. None of \nthe reports included severe hypoglycaemia. All patients recovered without complications. \n \nIn the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the \npatient\u2019s clinical signs and symptoms. The patient should be observed for clinical signs of dehydration \nand blood glucose should be monitored. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues.  \nATC code: A10BJ02  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLiraglutide is an acylated human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with 97% amino acid \nsequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1. Liraglutide binds to and activates the GLP-1 \nreceptor (GLP-1R). \n \nGLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake, but the exact mechanism of action is \nnot entirely clear. In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide led to uptake in specific \nbrain regions involved in regulation of appetite, where liraglutide, via specific activation of the GLP-\n1R, increased key satiety and decreased key hunger signals, thereby leading to lower body weight. \n \nGLP-1 receptors are also expressed in specific locations in the heart, vasculature, immune system and \nkidneys. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, liraglutide prevented aortic plaque progression and \nreduced inflammation in the plaque. In addition, liraglutide had a beneficial effect on plasma lipids. \nLiraglutide did not reduce the plaque size of already established plaques. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLiraglutide lowers body weight in humans mainly through loss of fat mass with relative reductions in \nvisceral fat being greater than for subcutaneous fat loss. Liraglutide regulates appetite by increasing \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nfeelings of fullness and satiety, while lowering feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption, \nthereby leading to reduced food intake. Liraglutide does not increase energy expenditure compared to \nplacebo. \n \nLiraglutide stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner \nwhich results in a lowering of fasting and post-prandial glucose. The glucose-lowering effect is more \npronounced in patients with pre-diabetes and diabetes compared to patients with normoglycaemia. \nClinical trials suggest that liraglutide improves and sustains beta-cell function, according to HOMA-B \nand the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of liraglutide for weight management in conjunction with reduced calorie \nintake and increased physical activity were studied in four phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled trials which included a total of 5,358 patients.  \n \n\u2022 Trial 1 (SCALE Obesity & Pre-Diabetes - 1839): A total of 3,731 patients with obesity (BMI \n\n\u226530 kg/m\u00b2) or with overweight (BMI \u226527 kg/m\u00b2) with dyslipidaemia and/or hypertension were \nstratified according to pre-diabetes status at screening and BMI at baseline (\u226530 kg/m\u00b2 or \n<30 kg/m\u00b2). All 3,731 patients were randomised to 56 weeks of treatment and the 2,254 patients \nwith pre-diabetes at screening were randomised to 160 weeks of treatment. Both treatment \nperiods were followed by a 12-week off drug/placebo observational follow-up period. Lifestyle \nintervention in the form of an energy-restricted diet and exercise counselling was background \ntherapy for all patients. \n\n The 56-week part of trial 1 assessed body weight loss in all the 3,731 randomised patients \n(2,590 completers).  \n\n The 160-week part of trial 1 assessed time to onset of type 2 diabetes in the 2,254 randomised \npatients with pre-diabetes (1,128 completers). \n\n\u2022 Trial 2 (SCALE Diabetes - 1922): A 56-week trial assessing body weight loss in 846 \nrandomised (628 completers) obese and overweight patients with insufficiently controlled type \n2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c range 7\u201310%). The background treatment at trial start was either diet \nand exercise alone, metformin, a sulfonylurea, a glitazone as single agents or any combination \nhereof. \n\n\u2022 Trial 3 (SCALE Sleep Apnoea - 3970): A 32-week trial assessing sleep apnoea severity and \nbody weight loss in 359 randomised (276 completers) obese patients with moderate or severe \nobstructive sleep apnoea. \n\n\u2022 Trial 4 (SCALE Maintenance - 1923): A 56-week trial assessing body weight maintenance \nand weight loss in 422 randomised (305 completers) obese and overweight patients with \nhypertension or dyslipidaemia after a preceding weight loss of \u22655% induced by a low-calorie \ndiet. \n\n \nBody weight \n \nSuperior weight loss was achieved with liraglutide compared to placebo in obese/overweight patients \nin all groups studied. Across the trial populations, greater proportions of the patients achieved \u22655% \nand >10% weight loss with liraglutide than with placebo (tables 3\u20135). In the 160-weeks part of trial 1, \nthe weight loss occurred mainly in the first year and was sustained throughout 160 weeks. In trial 4, \nmore patients maintained the weight loss achieved prior to treatment initiation with liraglutide than \nwith placebo (81.4% and 48.9%, respectively). Specific data on weight loss, responders, time course \nand cumulative distribution of weight change (%) for trials 1\u20134 are presented in tables 3\u20137 and figures \n1, 2 and 3.  \n \nWeight loss response after 12 weeks with liraglutide (3.0 mg) treatment \n \nEarly responders were defined as patients who achieved \u22655% weight loss after 12 weeks on treatment \ndose of liraglutide (4 weeks of dose escalation and 12 weeks on treatment dose). In the 56-week part \nof trial 1, 67.5% achieved \u22655% weight loss after 12 weeks. In trial 2, 50.4% achieved \u22655% weight loss \n\n\n\n11 \n\nafter 12 weeks. With continued treatment with liraglutide, 86.2% of these early responders are \npredicted to achieve a weight loss of \u22655% and 51% are predicted to achieve a weight loss of \u226510% \nafter 1 year of treatment. The predicted mean weight loss in early responders who complete 1 year of \ntreatment is 11.2% of their baseline body weight (9.7% for males and 11.6% for females). For patients \nwho have achieved a weight loss of <5% after 12 weeks on treatment dose of liraglutide, the \nproportion of patients not reaching a weight loss of \u226510% after 1 year is 93.4%. \n \nGlycaemic control \n \nTreatment with liraglutide significantly improved glycaemic parameters across sub-populations with \nnormoglycaemia, pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the 56-week part of trial 1, fewer \npatients treated with liraglutide had developed type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to patients treated \nwith placebo (0.2% vs. 1.1%). More patients with pre-diabetes at baseline had reversed their pre-\ndiabetes compared to patients treated with placebo (69.2% vs. 32.7%). In the 160-week part of trial 1, \nthe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus \nevaluated as time to onset. At week 160, while on treatment, 3% treated with Saxenda and 11% treated \nwith placebo were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The estimated time to onset of type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus for patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg was 2.7 times longer (with a 95% \nconfidence interval of [1.9, 3.9]), and the hazard ratio for risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus \nwas 0.2 for liraglutide versus placebo. \n \nCardiometabolic risk factors \n \nTreatment with liraglutide significantly improved systolic blood pressure and waist circumference \ncompared with placebo (tables 3, 4 and 5). \n \nApnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) \n \nTreatment with liraglutide significantly reduced the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea as assessed by \nchange from baseline in the AHI compared with placebo (table 6). \n \nTable 3 Trial 1: Changes from baseline in body weight, glycaemia and cardiometabolic \nparameters at week 56 \n Saxenda (N=2437) Placebo (N=1225) Saxenda vs. placebo \n\nBody weight    \nBaseline, kg (SD) 106.3 (21.2) 106.3 (21.7) - \nMean change at week 56, % (95% CI) -8.0 -2.6 -5.4** (-5.8; -5.0) \nMean change at week 56, kg (95% CI) -8.4 -2.8 -5.6** (-6.0; -5.1) \nProportion of patients losing \u22655% body \nweight at week 56, % (95% CI) 63.5 26.6 4.8** (4.1; 5.6) \n\nProportion of patients losing >10% body \nweight at week 56, % (95% CI) 32.8 10.1 4.3** (3.5; 5.3) \n\nGlycaemia and cardiometabolic factors Baseline Change Baseline Change  \nHbA1c, % 5.6 -0.3 5.6 -0.1 -0.23** (-0.25; -0.21) \nFPG, mmol/L 5.3 -0.4 5.3 -0.01 -0.38** (-0.42; -0.35) \n\nSystolic blood pressure, mmHg 123.0 -4.3 123.3 -1.5 -2.8** (-3.6; -2.1) \nDiastolic blood pressure, mmHg 78.7 -2.7 78.9 -1.8 -0.9* (-1.4; -0.4) \nWaist circumference, cm 115.0 -8.2 114.5 -4.0 -4.2** (-4.7; -3.7) \n\nFull Analysis Set.

At week 0 patients were \nrandomised to receive either Saxenda or placebo. \n \nImmunogenicity \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, \npatients may develop anti-liraglutide antibodies following treatment with liraglutide. In clinical trials, \n2.5% of patients treated with liraglutide developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Antibody formation has \nnot been associated with reduced efficacy of liraglutide. \n \nCardiovascular evaluation \n \nMajor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were adjudicated by an external independent group of \nexperts and defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death. In all \nthe long-term clinical trials with Saxenda, there were 6 MACE for patients treated with liraglutide and \n10 MACE for placebo-treated patients. The hazard ratio and 95% CI is 0.33 [0.12; 0.90] for liraglutide \nversus placebo. A mean increase in heart rate from baseline of 2.5 beats per minute (ranging across \ntrials from 1.6 to 3.6 beats per minute) has been observed with liraglutide in clinical phase 3 trials. The \nheart rate peaked after approximately 6 weeks. The long-term clinical impact of this mean increase in \nheart rate has not been established. The change in heart rate was reversible upon discontinuation of \nliraglutide (see section 4.4). \n \nThe Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes Results \n(LEADER) trial included 9,340 patients with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes. The vast \nmajority of these had established cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to either \nliraglutide on a daily dose of up to 1.8 mg (4,668) or placebo (4,672), both on a background of \nstandard of care. \n \nThe duration of exposure was between 3.5 and 5 years. The mean age was 64 years and the mean BMI \nwas 32.5 kg/m\u00b2. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.7 and had improved after 3 years by 1.2 % in patients \nassigned to liraglutide and by 0.8 % in patients assigned to placebo. The primary endpoint was the \ntime from randomisation to first occurrence of any major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. \n \nLiraglutide significantly reduced the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (primary endpoint \nevents, MACE) vs. placebo (3.41 vs. 3.90 per 100 patient years of observation in the liraglutide and \nplacebo groups, respectively) with a risk reduction of 13%, HR 0.87, [0.78, 0.97] [95% CI]) (p=0.005) \n(see figure 4).  \n \n \n\nPa\ntie\n\nnt\ns w\n\nith\n a\n\nn \nev\n\nen\nt (\n\n%\n) \n\nTime from randomization (months) \n\nPatients at risk \n\nFAS: full analysis set. \n\nPlacebo \n\nLiraglutide \n\nHR: 0.87 \n95% CI 0.78; 0.97 \n\np<0.001 for non-inferiority \np=0.005 for superiority \n\nPlacebo \nLiraglutide \n\n4672 \n4668 \n\n4587 \n4593 \n\n4473 \n4496 \n\n4352 \n4400 \n\n4237 \n4280 \n\n4123 \n4172 \n\n4010 \n4072 \n\n3914 \n3982 \n\n1543 \n1562 \n\n407 \n424 \n\n \n \nFigure 4 Kaplan Meier plot of time to first MACE \u2013 FAS population \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSaxenda in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of obesity and in the \ntreatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absorption of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration was slow, reaching maximum \nconcentration approximately 11 hours post dosing. The average liraglutide steady state concentration \n(AUC\u03c4/24) reached approximately 31 nmol/L in obese (BMI 30\u201340 kg/m2) patients following \nadministration of 3 mg liraglutide. Liraglutide exposure increased proportionally with dose. Absolute \nbioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration is 20\u201325 L (for a person \nweighing approximately 100 kg). Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%).  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDuring 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the \nmajor component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Two minor plasma metabolites were detected (\u22649% \nand \u22645% of total plasma radioactivity exposure). \n \nElimination \n \nLiraglutide is endogenously metabolised in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ \nas major route of elimination. Following a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in \nurine or faeces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related \nmetabolites in urine or faeces (6% and 5%, respectively). The urine and faeces radioactivity was \nmainly excreted during the first 6\u20138 days and corresponded to three minor metabolites, respectively.  \n \nThe mean clearance following subcutaneous administration of liraglutide is approximately 0.9\u20131.4 L/h \nwith an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \n \nAge had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results from a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of data from overweight and obese patients (18 to 82 years). No \ndosage adjustment is required based on age. \n \nGender \n \nBased on the results of population pharmacokinetic analysis, females have 24% lower weight adjusted \nclearance of liraglutide compared to males. Based on the exposure response data, no dose adjustment \nis necessary based on gender. \n \nEthnic origin \n \nEthnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the \nresults of population pharmacokinetic analysis which included overweight and obese patients of \nWhite, Black, Asian and Hispanic/non-Hispanic groups.  \n \nBody weight \n \nThe exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. The 3.0 mg daily dose \nof liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 60\u2013234 kg \n\n\n\n17 \n\nevaluated for exposure response in the clinical trials. Liraglutide exposure was not studied in patients \nwith body weight >234 kg. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of liraglutide was evaluated in patients with varying degree of hepatic \nimpairment in a single-dose trial (0.75 mg). Liraglutide exposure was decreased by 13\u201323% in patients \nwith mild to moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. Exposure was significantly \nlower (44%) in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score >9). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nLiraglutide exposure was reduced in patients with renal impairment compared to individuals with \nnormal renal function in a single-dose trial (0.75 mg). Liraglutide exposure was lowered by 33%, 14%, \n27% and 26%, respectively, in patients with mild (creatinine clearance, CrCl 50\u201380 ml/min), moderate \n(CrCl 30\u201350 ml/min) and severe (CrCl <30 ml/min) renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease \nrequiring dialysis. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPharmacokinetic properties were assessed in clinical pharmacology studies in the paediatric \npopulation with obesity aged 12-17 years (14 patients, body weight 80-122 kg) and 7-11 years (16 \npatients, body weight 45-87 kg) respectively.  \n \nThe liraglutide exposure in adolescents (age 12-17 years) was similar to that in adults with obesity. \nExposure associated with 3.0 mg liraglutide was found to be comparable between the children aged 7 \nto 11, adolescents and adult subjects, after correction for body weight.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity or genotoxicity. \n \nNon-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours were seen in two-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice. In \nrats, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was not observed. These tumours were not seen in \nmonkeys treated for 20 months. These findings in rodents are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific \nGLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for \nhumans is likely to be low but cannot be completely excluded. No other treatment-related tumours \nhave been found. \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility but slightly increased \nearly embryonic deaths at the highest dose. Dosing with liraglutide during mid-gestation caused a \nreduction in maternal weight and foetal growth with equivocal effects on ribs in rats and skeletal \nvariation in the rabbit. Neonatal growth was reduced in rats while exposed to liraglutide and persisted \nin the post-weaning period in the high dose group. It is unknown whether the reduced pup growth is \ncaused by reduced pup milk intake due to a direct GLP-1 effect or reduced maternal milk production \ndue to decreased caloric intake. \n \n \n6.

What Saxenda is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Saxenda is \nSaxenda is a weight loss medicine that contains the active substance liraglutide. It is similar to a \nnatural occurring hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is released from the intestine \nafter a meal. Saxenda works by acting on receptors in the brain that control your appetite, causing you \nto feel fuller and less hungry. This may help you eat less food and reduce your body weight. \n \nWhat Saxenda is used for \nSaxenda is used for weight loss in addition to diet and exercise in adults aged 18 and above who have  \n\u2022 a BMI of 30 kg/m\u00b2 or greater (obese) or \n\u2022 a BMI of 27 kg/m\u00b2 and less than 30 kg/m\u00b2 (overweight) and weight-related health problems \n\n(such as diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood or breathing \nproblems during sleep called \u2018obstructive sleep apnoea\u2019). \n\nBMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. \n \nYou should only continue using Saxenda if you have lost at least 5% of your initial body weight after \n12 weeks on the 3 mg/day dose (see section 3). Consult your doctor before you continue. \n \nDiet and exercise \nYour doctor will start you on a diet and exercise programme. Stay on this programme while you are \nusing Saxenda. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Saxenda  \n \nDo not use Saxenda \n\u2013 if you are allergic to liraglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Saxenda. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nThe use of Saxenda is not recommended if you have severe heart failure.  \n \nThere is little experience with this medicine in patients of 75 years and older. It is not recommended if \nyou are 75 years or older. \n \nThere is little experience with this medicine in patients with kidney problems. If you have kidney \ndisease or are on dialysis, consult your doctor.  \n \nThere is little experience with this medicine in patients with liver problems. If you have liver \nproblems, consult your doctor. \n \nThis medicine is not recommended if you have a severe stomach or gut problem which results in \ndelayed stomach emptying (called gastroparesis), or if you have an inflammatory bowel disease. \n \nPeople with diabetes  \n \nIf you have diabetes, do not use Saxenda as a replacement for insulin. \n \nInflammation of the pancreas \n \nTalk to your doctor if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas.  \n \nInflamed gall bladder and gallstones \n \nIf you lose substantial weight, you are at a risk of gallstones and thereby inflamed gall bladder. Stop \ntaking Saxenda and contact a doctor immediately if you experience severe pain in your upper \nabdomen, usually worst on the right side under the ribs. The pain may be felt through to your back or \nright shoulder. See section 4. \n \nThyroid disease \n \nIf you have thyroid disease, including thyroid nodules and enlargement of the thyroid gland, consult \nyour doctor. \n \nHeart rate \n \nTalk to your doctor if you have palpitations (you feel aware of your heartbeat) or if you have feelings \nof a racing heartbeat while at rest during Saxenda treatment.  \n \nLoss of fluid and dehydration \n \nWhen starting treatment with Saxenda, you may lose body fluid or become dehydrated. This may be \ndue to feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and diarrhoea. It is important to avoid dehydration \nby drinking plenty of fluids. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions or \nconcerns. See section 4. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nSaxenda should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because the \neffects and safety of this medicine have not been studied in this age group.  \n \nOther medicines and Saxenda \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if:  \n\u2022 you are taking medicines for diabetes called \u2018sulfonylurea\u2019 (such as glimepiride or \n\nglibenclamide) or if you are taking insulin \u2013 you may get low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \n\n\n\n31 \n\nwhen you use these medicines with Saxenda. Your doctor may adjust the dose of your diabetes \nmedicine to prevent you from getting low blood sugar. See section 4 for the warning signs of \nlow blood sugar. If you adjust your insulin dose your doctor may recommend you to monitor \nyour blood sugar more frequently. \n\n\u2022 you are taking warfarin or other medicines by mouth that reduce your blood clotting \n(anticoagulants). More frequent blood testing to determine the ability of your blood to clot may \nbe required. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nDo not use Saxenda if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to have a \nbaby. This is because it is not known if Saxenda may affect the baby. \n \nDo not breast-feed if you are using Saxenda. This is because it is not known if Saxenda passes into \nbreast milk.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nSaxenda is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.  \nSome patients may feel dizziness when taking Saxenda mainly during the first 3 months of treatment \n(see section \u2018Possible side effects\u2019). If you feel dizziness be extra careful while driving or using \nmachines. If you need any further information, talk to your doctor. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Saxenda \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that it is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3.

Get help from a person with good \neyesight who is trained to use the Saxenda pre-filled pen. \nYour pen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose pen. It contains 18 mg of liraglutide and \ndelivers doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg and 3.0 mg. Your pen is \ndesigned to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a \nlength of 8 mm and as thin as 32 G. \nNeedles are not included in the pack. \n \n\n Important information  \nPay special attention to these notes as they are important for safe use of the pen. \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nSaxenda pre-filled pen and \nneedle (example) \n\nPen cap \nOuter  \nneedle cap \n\nInner \nneedle cap \n\nNeedle \n\nPaper tab \n\nPen scale \n\nPen window \n\nPen label \n\nDose counter \n\nDose pointer \n\nDose selector \n\nDose button \n\nFlow \ncheck \nsymbol \n\nSaxenda \n\n \n\n \n\n1 Prepare your pen with a new needle \n \n\u2022 Check the name and coloured label of your pen, to make sure that it \n\ncontains Saxenda. This is especially important if you take more than one \ntype of injectable medicine. Using the wrong medicine could be harmful \nto your health. \n\n\u2022 Pull off the pen cap. \n\n A \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n\u2022 Check that the solution in your pen is clear and colourless. Look \nthrough the pen window. If the solution looks cloudy, do not use the pen. \n\n B \n\n \n\u2022 Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab.  C \n\n \n\u2022 Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight.  D \n\n \n\u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it \n\nafter the injection, to safely remove the needle from the pen. \n E \n\n \n\u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it \n\nback on, you may accidentally stick yourself with the needle. \nA drop of solution may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you \nmust still check the flow if you use a new pen for the first time. \nDo not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to take your \ninjection. \n\n \n Always use a new needle for each injection. \n\nThis may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection and \ninaccurate dosing. \n\n Never use a bent or damaged needle. \n\n F \n\n \n\n2 Check the flow \n \n\u2022 Before your first injection with each new pen, check the flow. If your \n\npen is already in use, go to step 3 \u2018Select your dose\u2019. \n\u2022 Turn the dose selector until the dose counter shows the flow check \n\nsymbol ( ). \n\n A \n\nFlow check \nsymbol \nselected \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n\u2022 Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. \nPress and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. \nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \nA drop of solution should appear at the needle tip. \n \nA small drop may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. \nIf no drop appears, repeat step 2 \u2018Check the flow\u2019 up to 6 times. If there \nis still no drop, change the needle and repeat step 2 \u2018Check the flow\u2019 once \nmore. \nIf a drop still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a new one. \n \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you use \na new pen for the first time. This makes sure that the solution flows.  \nIf no drop appears, you will not inject any medicine, even though the \ndose counter may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged \nneedle.  \nIf you do not check the flow before your first injection with each new \npen, you may not get the prescribed dose and the intended effect of \nSaxenda. \n\n B \n\n \n\n3 Select your dose \n \n\n\u2022 Turn the dose selector until the dose counter shows your dose \n(0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg or 3.0 mg).  \nIf you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forward or \nbackwards to the correct dose.  \nThe pen can dial up to a maximum of 3.0 mg. \n \nThe dose selector changes the dose. Only the dose counter and dose \npointer will show how many mg you select per dose. \nYou can select up to 3.0 mg per dose. When your pen contains less than \n3.0 mg the dose counter stops before 3.0 is shown. \nThe dose selector clicks differently when turned forward, backwards or \npast the number of mg left. Do not count the pen clicks. \n \n\n Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many \nmg you have selected before injecting this medicine.  \nDo not count the pen clicks. \nDo not use the pen scale. It only shows approximately how much solution \nis left in your pen. \nOnly doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg or 3.0 mg must be \nselected with the dose selector. The selected dose must line up precisely \nwith the dose pointer to ensure that you get a correct dose. \n\n A \n\nExample \n0.6 mg \nselected \n\n \n\nHow much solution is left? \n \n\n\u2022 The pen scale shows you approximately how much solution is left in \nyour pen. \n\n \n \n A Approx. \n\nhow much \nsolution is \nleft \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\u2022 To see precisely how much solution is left, use the dose counter:  \nTurn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. \nIf it shows 3.0, at least 3.0 mg are left in your pen. If the dose counter \nstops before 3.0 mg, there is not enough solution left for a full dose of \n3.0 mg. \n\n \nIf you need more medicine than what is left in your pen \nOnly if trained or advised by your doctor or nurse, you may split your dose \nbetween your current pen and a new pen. Use a calculator to plan the doses as \ninstructed by your doctor or nurse. \n \n\n Be very careful to calculate correctly. \nIf you are not sure how to split your dose using two pens, then select and \ninject the dose you need with a new pen. \n\n B \n\nExample \n\nDose counter \nstopped: \n2.4 mg left \n\n \n\n4 Inject your dose \n \n\u2022 Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. \n\u2022 Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your \n\nfingers. This could interrupt the injection. \n\n A \n\n \n\u2022 Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows 0. \n\nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a \nclick. \n\n B \n\n \n\u2022 Keep the needle in your skin after the dose counter has returned to 0 \n\nand count slowly to 6.  \n\u2022 If the needle is removed earlier, you may see a stream of solution coming \n\nfrom the needle tip. If so, the full dose will not be delivered. \n\n C Count slowly: \n\n1-2-3-4-5-6 \n\n \n\u2022 Remove the needle from your skin.  \n\nIf blood appears at the injection site, press lightly. Do not rub the area. \n \n\nYou may see a drop of solution at the needle tip after injecting. This is \nnormal and does not affect your dose. \n \n\n Always watch the dose counter to know how many mg you inject. \nHold the dose button down until the dose counter shows 0. \nHow to identify a blocked or damaged needle? \n\u2022 If 0 does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing \n\nthe dose button, you may have used a blocked or damaged needle. \n\u2022 In this case \u2013 you have not received any medicine \u2013 even though the \n\ndose counter has moved from the original dose that you have set. \n \nHow to handle a blocked needle? \n\n D \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nChange the needle as described in step 5 \u2018After your injection\u2019 and repeat \nall steps starting with step 1 \u2018Prepare your pen with a new needle\u2019. Make \nsure you select the full dose you need. \n \nNever touch the dose counter when you inject. This can interrupt the \ninjection. \n\n5 After your injection \n \n\u2022 Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without \n\ntouching the needle or the outer needle cap. \n\n A \n\n \n\u2022 Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap \n\ncompletely on.  \n\u2022 Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully. \n\n B \n\n \n\u2022 Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the solution from \n\nlight. \n \n\nAlways dispose of the needle after each injection to ensure convenient \ninjections and prevent blocked needles.
