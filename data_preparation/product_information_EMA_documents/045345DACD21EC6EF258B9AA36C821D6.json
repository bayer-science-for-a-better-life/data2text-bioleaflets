NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nUltratard 40 IU/ml \nSuspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInsulin human, rDNA (produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \n1 ml contains 40 IU of insulin human \n1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 400 IU \n \nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nUltratard is an insulin zinc suspension. The suspension consists of crystalline particles. \n \nFor excipients, see Section 6.1 List of excipients. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nUltratard is a cloudy, white, aqueous suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetes mellitus. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nUltratard is a long-acting insulin. \n \nDosage \nDosage is individual and determined by the physician in accordance with the needs of the patient. \nThe average range of total daily insulin requirement for maintenance therapy in type 1 diabetic patients \nlies between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/kg. In pre-pubertal children it usually varies from 0.7to 1.0 IU/kg. During \nthe period of partial remission, the insulin requirements can be much lower, whereas in insulin resistant \nstates e.g. during puberty or due to obesity, the daily insulin requirement may be substantially higher. \n \nInitial dosages for type 2 diabetic patients are often lower, e.g. 0.3 to 0.6 IU/kg/day. \n \nThe physician determines whether one or several daily injections are necessary. Ultratard may be used \nalone or mixed with fast-acting insulin. In intensive insulin therapy the suspension may be used as \nbasal insulin (evening and/or morning injection) with fast-acting insulin given at meals. \n \nIn patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset and slows the \nprogression of late diabetic complications. Blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended. \n \nDosage adjustment \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient's \ninsulin requirement. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement. \n \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet. \nDosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to \nanother (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use). \n \nAdministration \nFor subcutaneous use. \n \nUltratard is usually administered subcutaneously in the thigh. If convenient, the abdominal wall, the \ngluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used. \n \nSubcutaneous injection into the thigh results in a slower and less variable absorption compared to the \nother injection sites. \n \nInjection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection. \nKeep the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected. \nInjection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy. \n \nInsulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously. \n \nUltratard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed. \n \nThe vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypersensitivity to human insulin or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1 List of excipients). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nInadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. \nUsually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually, over a period of hours or days. They \ninclude thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry \nmouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath (see section 4.8 Undesirable effects). \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \nHypoglycaemia can generally be corrected by immediate carbohydrate intake. In order to be able to \ntake action immediately, patients should carry glucose with them at all times. \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly (see section 4.8 Undesirable effects). \nUsual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (fast-, dual-, long-acting insulin etc.), \nspecies (animal, human or analogue insulin) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus \nanimal source insulin) may result in a change in dosage. \nIf an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Ultratard, it may occur with the first dose or \nduring the first several weeks or months. \nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source \ninsulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or \ndifferent from those experienced with their previous insulin. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n\n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the doctor, \nsince this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times. \n \nInsulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps. \n \nUltratard contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate, which may cause allergic reactions (possibly \ndelayed). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. The physician \nmust therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask their patients about any \nmedicinal products they take. \n \nThe following substances may reduce insulin requirement: \nOral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non-selective beta-\nblocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates and alcohol. \n \nThe following substances may increase insulin requirement: \nThiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics, growth hormone and \ndanazol. \n \nBeta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not \npass the placental barrier. \n \nBoth hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes \ntherapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero. Intensified control in the treatment of \npregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when \ncontemplating pregnancy. \nInsulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and \nthird trimesters. \nAfter delivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. \n \nInsulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the Ultratard dosage \nmay need to be adjusted. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most often seen undesirable effect in insulin-treated patients is a change in blood glucose levels. \nFrom clinical investigations it is known that major hypoglycaemia, defined as need for assistance \nin treatment, occurs in approximately 20% of well-controlled patients. Based on post-marketing \nexperience adverse drug reactions including hypoglycaemia have been reported rarely (>1/10,000 \n<1/1,000). The listings below are all based on post-marketing experience and is subject to \nunderreporting and should be interpreted in that light. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n \nRare \n(>1/10,000 <1/1,000) \n\n \n\nChange in blood \nglucose \n \n\nHypoglycaemia: \nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include \ncold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, \nunusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, \ndrowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and \npalpitation. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of \nbrain function or even death. \n \nHyperglycaemia: \nUsually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually, over a \nperiod of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of \nurination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss \nof appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to \ndiabetic ketoacidosis which is potentially lethal. \nFor precautions see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions \nfor use. \n \n\nEye disorders \n \nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nRefraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These \nsymptoms are usually of transitory nature. \n \n\n  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nLocal hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the \ninjection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. These reactions are \nusually transitory and normally they disappear during continued treatment. \n \n\n  \nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure \nto rotate injection sites within an area. \n \n\n  \nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nSymptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin \nrash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, \ndifficulties in breathing, palpitation and reduction in blood pressure. \nGeneralised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life threatening. \n \n\nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nOedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These symptoms are \nusually of transitory nature. \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n6 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined. However, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages: \n• Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar \nlumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. \n\n• Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received \nappropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. Glucose \nmust also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 \nminutes. \nUpon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the \npatient in order to prevent relapse. \n\nAfter an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason \nfor this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antidiabetic agent ATC code: A10A E01. \n \nThe blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nUltratard is a very long-acting insulin. \nOnset of action is within 4 hours, reaches a maximum effect within 8-24 hours and the entire time of \nduration is approximately 28-32 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nInsulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of an \ninsulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. \n \nThis process is influenced by several factors (e.g. insulin dosage, injection route and site, thickness of \nsubcutaneous fat, type of diabetes). The pharmacokinetics of insulins is therefore affected by \nsignificant intra- and inter-individual variation. \n \nAbsorption \nThe maximum plasma concentration of the insulins is reached within 2-18 hours after subcutaneous \nadministration. \n \nDistribution \nNo profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been \nobserved. \n \nMetabolism \nHuman insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and \npossibly protein disulfide isomerase. A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin \nmolecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active. \n \nElimination \nThe terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue. The \nterminal half-life (t½) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n7 \n\ninsulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes). Trials have indicated a t½ of \nabout 13-15 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nZinc chloride \nSodium chloride \nMethyl parahydroxybenzoate \nSodium acetate \nSodium hydroxide or/and hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nInsulin suspensions should not be added to infusion fluids. \nMedicinal products added to the insulin suspension may cause degradation of the insulin, e.g. if the \nmedicinal products contain thiols or sulphites. \nMixing of Ultratard with phosphate buffered insulin preparations is not recommended due to the risk of \nprecipitation of zinc-phosphate, leading to an unpredictable timing of such insulin mixtures.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nUltratard 100 IU/ml \nSuspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInsulin human, rDNA (produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \n1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human \n1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 1000 IU \n \nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nUltratard is an insulin zinc suspension. The suspension consists of crystalline particles. \n \nFor excipients, see Section 6.1 List of excipients. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nUltratard is a cloudy, white, aqueous suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetes mellitus. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nUltratard is a long-acting insulin. \n \nDosage \nDosage is individual and determined by the physician in accordance with the needs of the patient. \nThe average range of total daily insulin requirement for maintenance therapy in type 1 diabetic patients \nlies between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/kg. In pre-pubertal children it usually varies from 0.7to 1.0 IU/kg. During \nthe period of partial remission, the insulin requirements can be much lower, whereas in insulin resistant \nstates e.g. during puberty or due to obesity, the daily insulin requirement may be substantially higher. \n \nInitial dosages for type 2 diabetic patients are often lower, e.g. 0.3 to 0.6 IU/kg/day. \n \nThe physician determines whether one or several daily injections are necessary. Ultratard may be used \nalone or mixed with fast-acting insulin. In intensive insulin therapy the suspension may be used as \nbasal insulin (evening and/or morning injection) with fast-acting insulin given at meals. \n \nIn patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset and slows the \nprogression of late diabetic complications. Blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended. \n \nDosage adjustment \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient's \ninsulin requirement. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n10 \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement. \n \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet. \nDosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to \nanother (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use). \n \nAdministration \nFor subcutaneous use. \n \nUltratard is usually administered subcutaneously in the thigh. If convenient, the abdominal wall, the \ngluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used. \n \nSubcutaneous injection into the thigh results in a slower and less variable absorption compared to the \nother injection sites. \n \nInjection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection. \nKeep the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected. \nInjection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy. \n \nInsulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously. \n \nUltratard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed. \n \nThe vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypersensitivity to human insulin or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1 List of excipients). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nInadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. \nUsually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually, over a period of hours or days. They \ninclude thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry \nmouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath (see section 4.8 Undesirable effects). \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \nHypoglycaemia can generally be corrected by immediate carbohydrate intake. In order to be able to \ntake action immediately, patients should carry glucose with them at all times. \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly (see section 4.8 Undesirable effects). \nUsual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (fast-, dual-, long-acting insulin etc.), \nspecies (animal, human or analogue insulin) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus \nanimal source insulin) may result in a change in dosage. \nIf an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Ultratard, it may occur with the first dose or \nduring the first several weeks or months. \nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source \ninsulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or \ndifferent from those experienced with their previous insulin. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n11 \n\n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the doctor, \nsince this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times. \n \nInsulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps. \n \nUltratard contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate, which may cause allergic reactions (possibly \ndelayed). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. The physician \nmust therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask their patients about any \nmedicinal products they take. \n \nThe following substances may reduce insulin requirement: \nOral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non-selective beta-\nblocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates and alcohol. \n \nThe following substances may increase insulin requirement: \nThiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics, growth hormone and \ndanazol. \n \nBeta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not \npass the placental barrier. \n \nBoth hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes \ntherapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero. Intensified control in the treatment of \npregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when \ncontemplating pregnancy. \nInsulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and \nthird trimesters. \nAfter delivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. \n \nInsulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the Ultratard dosage \nmay need to be adjusted. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n12 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most often seen undesirable effect in insulin-treated patients is a change in blood glucose levels. \nFrom clinical investigations it is known that major hypoglycaemia, defined as need for assistance \nin treatment, occurs in approximately 20% of well-controlled patients. Based on post-marketing \nexperience adverse drug reactions including hypoglycaemia have been reported rarely (>1/10,000 \n<1/1,000). The listings below are all based on post-marketing experience and is subject to \nunderreporting and should be interpreted in that light. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n \nRare \n(>1/10,000 <1/1,000) \n\n \n\nChange in blood \nglucose \n \n\nHypoglycaemia: \nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include \ncold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, \nunusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, \ndrowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and \npalpitation. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of \nbrain function or even death. \n \nHyperglycaemia: \nUsually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually, over a \nperiod of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of \nurination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss \nof appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to \ndiabetic ketoacidosis which is potentially lethal. \nFor precautions see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions \nfor use. \n \n\nEye disorders \n \nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nRefraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These \nsymptoms are usually of transitory nature. \n \n\n  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nLocal hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the \ninjection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. These reactions are \nusually transitory and normally they disappear during continued treatment. \n \n\n  \nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure \nto rotate injection sites within an area. \n \n\n  \nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nSymptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin \nrash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, \ndifficulties in breathing, palpitation and reduction in blood pressure. \nGeneralised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life threatening. \n \n\nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nOedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These symptoms are \nusually of transitory nature. \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n13 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined. However, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages: \n• Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar \nlumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. \n\n• Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received \nappropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. Glucose \nmust also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 \nminutes. \nUpon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the \npatient in order to prevent relapse. \n\nAfter an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason \nfor this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antidiabetic agent ATC code: A10A E01. \n \nThe blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nUltratard is a very long-acting insulin. \nOnset of action is within 4 hours, reaches a maximum effect within 8-24 hours and the entire time of \nduration is approximately 28-32 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nInsulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of an \ninsulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. \n \nThis process is influenced by several factors (e.g. insulin dosage, injection route and site, thickness of \nsubcutaneous fat, type of diabetes). The pharmacokinetics of insulins is therefore affected by \nsignificant intra- and inter-individual variation. \n \nAbsorption \nThe maximum plasma concentration of the insulins is reached within 2-18 hours after subcutaneous \nadministration. \n \nDistribution \nNo profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been \nobserved. \n \nMetabolism \nHuman insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and \npossibly protein disulfide isomerase. A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin \nmolecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active. \n \nElimination \nThe terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue. The \nterminal half-life (t½) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n14 \n\ninsulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes). Trials have indicated a t½ of \nabout 13-15 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nZinc chloride \nSodium chloride \nMethyl parahydroxybenzoate \nSodium acetate \nSodium hydroxide or/and hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nInsulin suspensions should not be added to infusion fluids. \nMedicinal products added to the insulin suspension may cause degradation of the insulin, e.g. if the \nmedicinal products contain thiols or sulphites. \nMixing of Ultratard with phosphate buffered insulin preparations is not recommended due to the risk of \nprecipitation of zinc-phosphate, leading to an unpredictable timing of such insulin mixtures. When \nmixing Actrapid with Ultratard immediate injection is necessary to avoid blunting of the fast acting \neffect of Actrapid. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n30 months. \n \nAfter first opening: 6 weeks. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore at 2°C - 8°C (in a refrigerator) not near a freezing compartment. \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the container in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nDuring use: do not refrigerate.

Keep this leaflet. You may \nneed to read it again. \nIf you have further questions, please ask your doctor, diabetes nurse or pharmacist. This medicine is \nprescribed for you personally and you should not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their \nsymptoms are the same as yours.  \n \nUltratard 40 IU/ml Suspension for injection in a vial \nSuspension for injection in a vial. Insulin human, rDNA. \nUltratard is a zinc suspension consisting of crystalline particles. \nThe active substance is insulin human made by recombinant biotechnology. \n1 ml contains 40 IU of insulin human. 1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 400 IU. \nUltratard also contains zinc chloride, sodium chloride, methyl parahydroxy benzoate, sodium \nactetate, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and water for injections. \nThe suspension for injection comes as a white, cloudy suspension in packs of 1 or 5 vials of 10 ml (not \nall packs may be marketed). \nThe marketing authorisation holder and manufacturer is Novo Nordisk A/S, Novo Allé,  \nDK-2880 Bagsværd, Denmark. \n \n \n1 What Ultratard is \n \nUltratard is human insulin to treat diabetes. It comes in a 10 ml vial that you use to fill a syringe. \nUltratard is a very long-acting insulin. This means that it will start to lower your blood sugar about 4 \nhours after you take it, and the effect will last for approximately 28 hours. Ultratard is often given in \ncombination with fast-acting insulins. \n \n \n2 Before you use Ultratard \n \nDo not use Ultratard \n► If you feel a hypo coming on (a hypo is short for a hypoglycaemic reaction and is symptoms of \n\nlow blood sugar). See 4 What to do in an emergency for more about hypos \n► If you have ever had an allergic reaction to this insulin product or any of the ingredients (see \n\nbox, below left). Some people are allergic to the ingredient methyl parahydroxy benzoate. Look \nout for the signs of allergy in 5 Possible side effects. \n\n \nTake special care with Ultratard \n► If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands \n► If you are drinking alcohol: watch for signs of a hypo \n► If you are exercising more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet \n► If you are ill: carry on taking your insulin \n► If you are going abroad: travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs  \n► If you are pregnant, or planning a pregnancy: you must be especially careful to control your \n\nblood sugar; too much or too little could harm your health and the baby’s  \n► If you are breastfeeding: there’s no risk to the baby, but you may need to adjust your insulin and \n\nyour diet \n► If you drive or use tools or machines: watch out for signs of a hypo. Your ability to concentrate \n\nor to react will be less during a hypo. Never drive or use machinery if you feel a hypo coming \non. Discuss with your doctor whether you should drive or use machines at all, if you have a lot \nof hypos or if you find it hard to recognise hypos. \n\n \nOther medicines and Ultratard \nMany medicines affect the way glucose works in your body and they may influence your insulin dose. \nListed below are the most important medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. Talk to your \ndoctor if you take or change any other medicines, even those not-prescribed. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n32 \n\nYour need for insulin may change if you also take: oral hypoglycaemic agents; monoamine oxidase \ninhibitors (MAOI); certain beta-blockers; ACE-inhibitors; acetylsalicylic acid; thiazides; \nglucocorticoids; thyroid hormone therapy; beta-sympathomimetics; growth hormone; danazol; \noctreotide and lanreotide. \n \n \n3 Using Ultratard \n \nTalk about your insulin needs with your doctor and diabetes nurse. Follow their advice carefully. This \nleaflet is a general guide. \nIf your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be \nadjusted by your doctor. \n \nBefore using Ultratard \n► Make sure it is the right type of insulin \n► Disinfect the rubber membrane with surgical spirit. \n \nDo not use Ultratard \n► If the protective cap is loose or missing. Each vial has a protective, tamperproof plastic cap. If it \n\nisn’t in perfect condition when you get the vial, return the vial to your supplier \n► If it hasn’t been stored correctly or been frozen (see 6 How to store Ultratard) \n► If it’s not uniformly white and cloudy after rolling. \n\n \nHow to use this insulin \nUltratard is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a vein \nor muscle. Always vary the sites you inject, to avoid lumps (see 5 Possible side effects). The best place \nto give yourself an injection is the front of your thighs. If convenient, the front of your waist \n(abdomen), your buttocks or the front of your upper arms may be used. \n \nYou should always measure your blood glucose regularly. \n \nUltratard vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale. \n \nTo inject Ultratard on its own \n• Just before injecting this insulin, roll the vial between your hands until the liquid is uniformly \n\nwhite and cloudy \n• Draw air into the syringe, in the same amount as the dose of insulin you need \n• Inject the air into the vial: push the needle through the rubber stopper and press the plunger  \n• Turn the vial and syringe upside down  \n• Draw the right dose of insulin into the syringe \n• Pull the needle out of the vial \n• Make sure there is no air left in the syringe: point the needle upwards and push the air out \n• Check you have the right dose \n• Inject straight away.  \n \nTo mix Ultratard with fast acting insulin \n• Roll the vial of Ultratard between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white and cloudy \n• Draw as much air into the syringe as the dose of Ultratard you need. Inject the air into the \n\nUltratard vial, then pull out the needle \n• Draw as much air into the syringe as the dose of fast acting insulin you need. Inject the air into \n\nthe fast acting insulin vial. Then turn the vial and syringe upside down \n• Draw the right dose of fast acting insulin into the syringe. Pull the needle out of the vial. \n\nMake sure there is no air left in the syringe: point the needle upwards and push the air out. \nCheck the dose \n\n• Now push the needle into the vial of Ultratard. Then turn the vial and syringe upside down \n• Draw the right dose of Ultratard into the syringe. Pull the needle out of the vial.

Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or diabetes \n\nnurse \n• Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the full dose has been \n\ndelivered. \n \n \n4 What to do in an emergency \n \nIf you get a hypo \nA hypo means your blood sugar level is too low. \nThe warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include: cold sweat; cool pale skin; \nheadache; rapid heart beat; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; \nunusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in \nconcentrating.  \nIf you get any of these signs: eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack (sweets, biscuits, fruit juice), \nthen rest.  \nDon’t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on. \nCarry glucose tablets, sweets, biscuits or fruit juice with you, just in case. \nTell people that if you pass out (become unconscious), they should: turn you on your side and get \nmedical help straight away. They should not give you any food or drink. It could choke you. \n► If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and \n\neven death \n► If you have a hypo that makes you pass out, or a lot of hypos, talk to your doctor. The amount or \n\ntiming of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n \nUsing glucagon \nYou may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by \nsomeone who knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack \nas soon as you are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated \nin a hospital. Contact your doctor or an emergency ward after an injection of glucagon: you need to \nfind the reason for your hypo to avoid getting more. \n \nCauses of a hypo \nYou get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low. This might happen: \n• If you take too much insulin \n• If you eat too little or miss a meal  \n• If you exercise more than usual. \n \nIf your blood sugar gets too high \nYour blood sugar may get too high (this is called hyperglycaemia).  \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity smell of the breath. \nIf you get any of these signs: test your blood sugar level; test your urine for ketones if you can; then \nseek medical advice straight away.  \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. If you don’t treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and death.  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n34 \n\nCauses of a hyperglycaemia \n• Having forgotten to take your insulin \n• Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need \n• An infection or a fever \n• Eating more than usual \n• Less exercise than usual. \n \n \n5 Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Ultratard can have side effects. \n \nCommon side effects (up to 10%) \n \nLow or high blood sugar (hypo or hyperglycaemia). Taking too much or too little Ultratard may \ncause respectively hypo or hyperglycaemia. See the advice in 4 What to do in an emergency. \n \nRare side effects (up to 0.1%) \n \nVision problems. When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \nreaction usually disappears. \n \nChanges at the injection site. Reactions (redness, swelling, itching) at the injection site may occur \nand will normally disappear during use. If you inject yourself too often in the same site, lumps may \ndevelop underneath. Prevent this by choosing different injection sites each time within the same area. \n \nSigns of allergy. Very rarely, people get redness, swelling or itching around the area of the insulin \ninjection (local allergic reactions). These usually go away after a few weeks of taking your insulin. If \nthey do not go away, see your doctor. \nSeek medical advice straight away: \n► If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body, or \n► If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heart beat; feel dizzy.  \nYou may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Ultratard or one of its ingredients (called a \nsystemic allergic reaction). See also the warning in 2 Before you use Ultratard. \n \nSwollen joints. When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. This soon goes away. \n \nIf you notice any side effects, also those not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \n \n6 How to store Ultratard \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \nUltratard vials that are not being used are to be stored in the fridge at 2°C - 8°C, away from the \nfreezer compartment. Do not freeze. \nUltratard vials that are being used or about to be used are not to be kept in the fridge. You can carry \nthem with you and keep them at room temperature (below 25°C) for up to 6 weeks. \nAlways keep the vial in the outer carton when you’re not using it in order to protect it from light. \nUltratard should be protected from excessive heat and sunlight. \nDo not use Ultratard after the expiry date stated on the label and the carton. \n \nLeaflet last approved on \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n35 \n\nUltratard \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using your insulin.
