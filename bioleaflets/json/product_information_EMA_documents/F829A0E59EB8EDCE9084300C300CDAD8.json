CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of influenza \n \nXofluza is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 12 years and above. \n \nPost-exposure prophylaxis of influenza \n \nXofluza is indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in individuals aged 12 years and \nabove. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nXofluza should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment of influenza \nA single dose of baloxavir marboxil should be taken as soon as possible within 48 hours of symptom \nonset. \n \nPost-exposure prophylaxis of influenza \nA single dose of baloxavir marboxil should be taken as soon as possible within 48 hours following close \ncontact with an individual known or suspected to have influenza (see section 5.1). \n \nAdults and adolescents (≥ 12 years of age)  \nThe recommended oral dose of baloxavir marboxil depending on body weight is shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1. Baloxavir marboxil dosing by patient weight \n \n\nPatient body weight Recommended oral dose \n\n < 80 kg Single dose of 40 mg taken as \n2 x 20 mg tablets \n\n≥ 80 kg Single dose of 80 mg taken as \n2 x 40 mg tablets \n\n \nThere are no clinical data on the use of a repeat dose of baloxavir marboxil for the treatment of \nuncomplicated influenza or for post-exposure prophylaxis in any one influenza season. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years) \nNo dosage adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass A or B). The safety and efficacy of baloxavir marboxil has not been established in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of baloxavir marboxil in children aged < 12 years has not been established. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. The tablets should be taken with water.  \n \nXofluza may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \nXofluza should not be taken with products that contain polyvalent cations such as laxatives, antacids \nor oral supplements containing iron, zinc, selenium, calcium or magnesium (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLactose intolerance \n \nXofluza contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium- \nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on baloxavir marboxil or its active metabolite baloxavir \n \nProducts that contain polyvalent cations may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir. Xofluza \nshould not be taken with products that contain polyvalent cations such as laxatives, antacids or oral \nsupplements containing iron, zinc, selenium, calcium or magnesium. \n \nImmune response to influenza virus \n \nInteraction studies with influenza vaccines and baloxavir marboxil have not been conducted. In studies \nof naturally acquired and experimental influenza, treatment with Xofluza did not impair the humoral \nantibody response to influenza infection. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited data from the use of baloxavir marboxil in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n \n As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Xofluza during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir are excreted in human milk. Baloxavir \nmarboxil and its metabolites are secreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from baloxavir marboxil \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFertility \n \nNo effects on male or female fertility were observed in animal studies performed with baloxavir \nmarboxil (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXofluza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the postmarketing setting which include reports of \nanaphylaxis/anaphylactic reactions and less severe forms of hypersensitivity reactions including \nurticaria and angioedema. Of these adverse reactions only urticaria has been observed in clinical \nstudies with an estimated frequency category of “uncommon”. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse drug reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with \nbaloxavir marboxil (Table 2) based on spontaneous case reports and cases from non-interventional \nstudy programmes. Adverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ classes in \nMedDRA and the corresponding frequency category estimation for each adverse drug reaction is \nbased on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). \n \nTable 2. Adverse drug reactions from postmarketing experience  \n \n\nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Adverse Reaction \n(preferred term, MedDRA) \n\nFrequency \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylaxis Not known  \nAnaphylactic reactions Not known  \nHypersensitivity Not known  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous disorders Urticaria Uncommon \n\nAngioedema Not known  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile in 109 adolescent patients (≥ 12 years to < 18 years) was similar to that in adult \npatients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with baloxavir marboxil have been received from clinical trials and during \npostmarketing experience. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse reactions were \nreported. Data are insufficient to determine what symptoms may be anticipated as a result of an \noverdose. \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nManagement \n \nNo known specific antidote exists for Xofluza. In the event of overdose, standard supportive medical \ncare should be initiated based on the patient’s signs and symptoms. \n \nBaloxavir is unlikely to be significantly removed by dialysis due to high serum protein binding. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other anti-virals. ATC code: J05AX25. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBaloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted by hydrolysis to baloxavir, the active form that \nexerts anti-influenza activity. Baloxavir acts on the cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN), an influenza \nvirus-specific enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex \nand thereby inhibits the transcription of influenza virus genomes resulting in inhibition of influenza \nvirus replication. \n \nIn vitro activity \nThe 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of baloxavir was 1.4 to 3.1 nmol/L for influenza A viruses \nand 4.5 to 8.9 nmol/L for influenza B viruses in an enzyme inhibition assay. \n \nIn a MDCK cell culture assay, the median 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of baloxavir \nwere 0.73 nmol/L (n=31; range: 0.20-1.85 nmol/L) for subtype A/H1N1 strains, 0.83 nmol/L (n=33; \nrange: 0.35-2.63 nmol/L) for subtype A/H3N2 strains, and 5.97 nmol/L (n=30; range: \n2.67-14.23 nmol/L) for type B strains. \n \nIn an MDCK cell-based virus titre reduction assay, the 90% effective concentration (EC90) values of \nbaloxavir were in the range of 0.46 to 0.98 nmol/L for subtype A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses, 0.80 to \n3.16 nmol/L for avian subtype A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 viruses, and 2.21 to 6.48 nmol/L for type B \nviruses. \n \nResistance \nViruses bearing the PA/I38T/F/M/N mutation selected in vitro or in clinical studies show reduced \nsusceptibility to baloxavir with changes in EC50 values ranging from 11 to 57-fold for influenza A \nviruses and 2 to 8-fold for influenza B viruses.  \n \nIn the two Phase 3 studies of treatment of uncomplicated influenza (see below) no resistance to \nbaloxavir was detected in baseline isolates. Treatment-emergent mutations PA/I38T/M/N were \ndetected in 36/370 (9.7%) and in 15/290 (5.2%) patients treated with baloxavir marboxil but were not \ndetected in any patients treated with placebo.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 study of post-exposure prophylaxis (see below), treatment-emergent mutations \nPA/I38T/M were found in 10 of 374 (2.7%) baloxavir marboxil-treated subjects. PA/I38 substitutions \nwere not detected in placebo-treated subjects, with the exception of 2 subjects who received baloxavir \nmarboxil as rescue medication. \n \nBaloxavir is active in vitro against influenza viruses that are considered resistant to neuraminidase \ninhibitors, including strains with the following mutations: H274Y in A/H1N1, E119V and R292K in \nA/H3N2, R152K and D198E in type B virus, H274Y in A/H5N1, R292K in A/H7N9. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nClinical trials \n \nTreatment of uncomplicated influenza \n \nCapstone 1 (1601T0831), was a Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, multicentre study conducted in \nJapan and the US to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil \ncompared with placebo and with oseltamivir in healthy adult and adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 years \nto ≤ 64 years) with uncomplicated influenza. Patients were randomised to receive baloxavir marboxil \n(patients who weighed 40 to < 80 kg received 40 mg and patients who weighed ≥ 80 kg received \n80 mg), oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days (only if aged ≥ 20 years) or placebo. Dosing \noccurred within 48 hours of first onset of symptoms. \n \nA total of 1436 patients (of which 118 were aged ≥ 12 years to ≤ 17 years) were enrolled in the 2016-\n2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The predominant influenza virus strain in this study was \nthe A/H3 subtype (84.8% to 88.1%) followed by the B type (8.3% to 9.0%) and the A/H1N1pdm \nsubtype (0.5% to 3.0%).  The primary efficacy endpoint was time to alleviation of symptoms (cough, \nsore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) \n(TTAS). Baloxavir marboxil elicited a statistically significant reduction in TTAS when compared with \nplacebo (Table 3). \n \nTable 3.

No \ndifference was noted in duration of fever in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with the \noseltamivir group. \n \nCapstone 2 (1602T0832) was a Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo and with \noseltamivir in adult and adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with uncomplicated influenza who had \nat least one host factor predisposing to the development of complications. Patients were randomised to \nreceive a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil (according to weight as in Capstone 1),  oseltamivir \n75 mg twice daily for 5 days, or placebo. Dosing occurred within 48 hours of first onset of symptoms. \n \nOf the total 2184 patients 59 were aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 17 years, 446 were aged ≥ 65 to ≤ 74 years, 142 \nwere aged ≥ 75 to ≤ 84 years and 14 were aged ≥ 85 years. The predominant influenza viruses in this \nstudy were the A/H3 subtype (46.9% to 48.8%) and influenza B (38.3% to 43.5%). The primary \nefficacy endpoint was time to improvement of influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, \nnasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) (TTIS). Baloxavir marboxil \nelicited a statistically significant reduction in TTIS when compared with placebo (Table 4).  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nTable 4 .

No clear differences \nbetween the baloxavir marboxil group and the oseltamivir group were observed.  \n \nThe overall incidence of influenza-related complications (death, hospitalisation, sinusitis, otitis media, \nbronchitis, and/or pneumonia) was 2.8% (11/388 patients) in the baloxavir marboxil group compared \nwith 10.4% (40/386 patients) in the placebo group.  The lower overall incidence of influenza-related \ncomplications in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with the placebo group was mainly driven by \nlower incidences of bronchitis (1.8% vs. 6.0%, respectively) and sinusitis (0.3% vs. 2.1%, \nrespectively).   \n \nPost-exposure prophylaxis of influenza \n \nStudy 1719T0834 was a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study conducted in \n749 subjects in Japan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil \n\n\n\n9 \n\ncompared with placebo for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. Subjects were household contacts \nof influenza-infected index patients. \n \nA total of 607 subjects 12 years of age and over received either baloxavir marboxil dosed according to \nweight, as in the treatment studies, or placebo. The majority (74%) was enrolled within 24 hours of \nsymptom onset in the index patient group. The predominant influenza virus strains in the index \npatients were the A/H3 subtype (49.1%) and the A/H1N1pdm subtype (46.2%) followed by influenza \nB (0.9%). \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of household subjects who were infected with \ninfluenza virus and presented with fever and at least one respiratory symptom in the period from Day \n1 to Day 10. \n \nThere was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of subjects with laboratory-confirmed \nclinical influenza from 13.6% in the placebo group to 1.9% in the baloxavir marboxil group (see \nTable 6). \n \nTable 6.

The absolute bioavailability \nof baloxavir after oral dosing with baloxavir marboxil has not been established. \n \nFood effect \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nA food-effect study involving administration of baloxavir marboxil to healthy volunteers under fasting \nconditions and with a meal (approximately 400 to 500 kcal including 150 kcal from fat) indicated that \nthe Cmax and AUC of baloxavir were decreased by 48% and 36%, respectively, under fed conditions. \nTmax was unchanged in the presence of food. In clinical studies there were no clinically relevant \ndifferences in efficacy when baloxavir was taken with vs.without food. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn an in-vitro study, the binding of baloxavir to human serum proteins, primarily albumin, is 92.9% to \n93.9%. The apparent volume of distribution of baloxavir during the terminal elimination phase (Vz/F) \nfollowing a single oral administration of baloxavir marboxil is approximately 1180 litres in Caucasian \nsubjects and 647 litres in Japanese subjects.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBaloxavir is primarily metabolised by UGT1A3 to form a glucuronide with a minor contribution from \nCYP3A4 to form a sulfoxide. \n \nDrug-drug interaction studies \n \nBased on in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies, baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir \nare not expected to inhibit isozymes of the CYP or UGT families or cause relevant induction of CYP \nenzymes. \n \nBased on in vitro transporter studies and in vivo DDI studies, no relevant pharmacokinetic interaction \nis anticipated between baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir and medicines which are substrates of the \nfollowingtransporters: OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2K. \n \nExcretion \n \nFollowing a single oral administration of 40 mg of [14C]-labeled baloxavir marboxil, the proportion of \ntotal radioactivity excreted in faeces was 80.1% of the administered dose, with the urine accounting \nfor 14.7% (3.3% and 48.7% of the administered dose was excreted as baloxavir in urine and faeces \nrespectively). \n \nElimination \n \nThe apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2,z) of baloxavir after a single oral administration of \nbaloxavir marboxil is 79.1 hours in Caucasian subjects. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nFollowing single oral administration of baloxavir marboxil, baloxavir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics \nwithin the dose range of 6 mg to 80 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nBody weight \nBody weight is a significant covariate for baloxavir pharmacokinetics based on the population \npharmacokinetic analysis. Dosing recommendations for baloxavir marboxil are based on body weight \n(see section 4.2). \n \nGender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of gender on the \npharmacokinetics of baloxavir. No dose adjustment based on gender is required. \n \nRace \n\n\n\n11 \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, race is a covariate on oral clearance (CL/F) of \nbaloxavir in addition to body weight; however, no dose adjustment of baloxavir marboxil based on \nrace is required. \n \nAge \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis using plasma baloxavir concentrations from clinical studies in \nsubjects aged 12 to 64 years did not identify age as a relevant covariate on the pharmacokinetics of \nbaloxavir. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere are limited data on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in paediatric patients (< 12 years of age). \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetic data collected in 181 patients aged ≥ 65 years show that exposure to baloxavir in the \nplasma was similar to that in patients aged ≥ 12 to 64 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir have not \nbeen evaluated. Renal impairment is not expected to alter the elimination of baloxavir marboxil or \nbaloxavir. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir were observed in patients \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B) compared with healthy controls \nwith normal hepatic function. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated (see section \n4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNonclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity.  \n \nProlongation of PT and APTT were observed in rats at exposures at least equal to the human exposure \nbased on AUC0-24hr under specific experimental conditions, i.e. when fasted and when the food was \neither autoclaved or radiation-treated, resulting in vitamin K limiting/deficient conditions. These \neffects were not observed in monkey studies up to 4 weeks duration at the highest tested dose \nequivalent to 8-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. They are considered to be of limited \nclinical relevance. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with baloxavir marboxil. \n \nThe pro-drug baloxavir marboxil, and its active form, baloxavir, were not considered genotoxic as \nthey tested negative in bacterial reverse mutation tests, micronucleus tests with cultured mammalian \ncells, and as baloxavir marboxil was negative in an in vivo rodent micronucleus test. \n \nBaloxavir marboxil had no effects on fertility when given orally to male and female rats at doses \nproviding exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. \n\n \n\nBaloxavir marboxil did not cause malformations in rats or rabbits. \n \nThe oral embryo-foetal development study of baloxavir marboxil in rats with daily doses from \ngestation day 6 to 17 revealed no signs of maternal or foetal toxicity up to the highest tested dose \nproviding exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn rabbits, a dose providing exposure equivalent to 14-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr \nfollowing the MHRD caused maternal toxicity resulting in miscarriages and significant increase in \nincidence of foetuses with a skeletal variation (cervical rib). The skeletal variations were reabsorbed \nduring the growing process of adjacent cervical vertebra. A dose providing exposure equivalent to 6-\ntimes the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr in rabbits was without adverse effects. \n \nThe pre- and postnatal study in rats did not show drug-related adverse findings in dams and pups up to \nthe highest tested dose providing exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on \nAUC0-24hr. \n \n \n6.

What Xofluza is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Xofluza is \n \nXofluza contains baloxavir marboxil. This is a type of antiviral medicine called a ‘cap-dependent \nendonuclease inhibitor’.  \n \nXofluza is used for treating and preventing influenza. This medicine stops the influenza virus from \nspreading in the body and helps shorten the time to recovery from symptoms.  \n \nWhat Xofluza is used for \n \n• Xofluza is used to treat influenza in patients aged 12 years and above who have had influenza \n\nsymptoms for less than 48 hours. \n• Xofluza is used to prevent influenza in individuals aged 12 years and above who have been in \n\nclose contact with someone who is known or suspected to have influenza. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xofluza \n \nDo not take Xofluza if: \n \n• you are allergic to baloxavir marboxil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xofluza. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children below 12 years of age. This is because the effects of Xofluza in \nthis age group are not known.  \n \nOther medicines and Xofluza \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nDo not take Xofluza with:  \n• laxatives, antacids or oral supplements containing iron, zinc, selenium, calcium, or magnesium \n \nThe medicines listed above may decrease the effect of Xofluza.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as a \nprecautionary measure it is preferable to avoid the use of Xofluza. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for \nadvice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nXofluza is not likely to change your ability to drive and to use machines. \n \nXofluza contains lactose \n \nXofluza contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nXofluza contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 23 mg of sodium per tablet, that is to say essentially ꞌsodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take Xofluza \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nHow to take Xofluza \n \nFor treatment of influenza, take Xofluza as a single dose as soon as possible within 48 hours of your \nflu symptoms starting. \n \nFor prevention of influenza, take Xofluza as a single dose as soon as possible within 48 hours \nfollowing exposure to an infected person. \n \nHow much Xofluza to take \n \nYour dose of Xofluza depends on how much you weigh. Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how \nmuch to take. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nYour weight \n \n\nXofluza dose \n\nUp to 80 kg \n \n\nSingle dose of 40 mg taken as \n- 2 x 20 mg tablets \n\n \n80 kg or more \n \n\nSingle dose of 80 mg taken as  \n- 2 x 40 mg tablets \n\n \n \nXofluza can be taken with or without food. Take all the tablets with some water.   \n \nIf you take more Xofluza than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more of this medicine than you should, talk to your doctor or pharmacist for \nadvice. \n \nIf you forget to take Xofluza \n \nIf you forget to take some or all of your dose, take it as soon as possible.  \n \nFor the treatment of influenza, Xofluza should be taken within 48 hours of your flu symptoms starting. \n \nFor the prevention of influenza, Xofluza should be taken within 48 hours of close contact with \nsomeone who is known or suspected to have flu. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \nLike all medicines, it is possible for this medicine to cause side effects, although not everybody gets \nthem. \n \n\nGet medical help immediately if you get any of the following serious side effects: \n• Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), with signs such as swelling of the face or skin, itchy \n\nrashes, low blood pressure and difficulty breathing \n \n\nThe frequency of these side effects cannot be estimated from the available data. \n \nOther possible side effects: \nThe following side effect is uncommon (this can affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n\n• Itchy rash \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.
