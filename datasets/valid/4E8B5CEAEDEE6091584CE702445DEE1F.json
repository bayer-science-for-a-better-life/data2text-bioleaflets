CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nGlyxambi, fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin, is indicated in adults aged \n18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus:\n\uf0b7 to improve glycaemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea (SU) and one of the \n\nmonocomponents of Glyxambi do not provide adequate glycaemic control\n\uf0b7 when already being treated with the free combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin\n\n(See sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on combinations studied)\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended starting dose is 1 film-coated tablet of Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg (10 mg empagliflozin \nplus 5 mg linagliptin) once daily.\n\nIn patients who tolerate this starting dose and require additional glycaemic control, the dose can be \n\n\n\n3\n\nincreased to 1 film-coated tablet of Glyxambi 25 mg/5 mg (25 mg empagliflozin plus 5 mg linagliptin) \nonce daily.\n\nWhen Glyxambi is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the \nsulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.4, 4.5 \nand 4.8).\n\nPatients switching from empagliflozin (either 10 mg or 25 mg daily dose) and linagliptin (5 mg daily \ndose) to Glyxambi should receive the same daily dose of empagliflozin and linagliptin in the fixed \ndose combination as in separate tablets. The metformin dose should be continued.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\n\nDue to the mechanism of action, decreased renal function will result in reduced glycaemic efficacy of \nempagliflozin (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\uf0b7 In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m2 or \n\ncreatinine clearance (CrCl) \u226560 mL/min, no dose adjustment is required.\n\uf0b7 In patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl <60 mL/min, Glyxambi should not be \n\ninitiated.\n\uf0b7 In patients tolerating Glyxambi whose eGFR falls persistently below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or \n\nCrCl below 60 mL/min, the dose of Glyxambi should be adjusted to or maintained at 10 mg \nempagliflozin plus 5 mg linagliptin once daily.\n\n\uf0b7 When eGFR is persistently below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl persistently below 45 mL/min, \ntreatment should be discontinued (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2).\n\n\uf0b7 In patients with end-stage renal disease or in patients on dialysis, Glyxambi should not be used \nas empagliflozin is not expected to be effective in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nEmpagliflozin exposure is increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therapeutic \nexperience in such patients is limited (see section 5.2). Therefore, Glyxambi is not recommended for \nuse in this population.\n\nElderly\n\nNo dosage adjustment based on age is required. However, renal function and risk of volume depletion \nshould be taken into account in elderly patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Based on very limited \nexperience in patients 75 years and older, initiation of Glyxambi therapy is not recommended in this \npopulation (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nSafety and efficacy of Glyxambi in paediatric patients below 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nGlyxambi tablets are for oral use and can be taken with or without a meal at any time of the day at \nregular intervals. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. If a dose is missed, and it is 12 \nhours or more until the next dose, the dose should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. The next \ndose should be taken at the usual time. If a dose is missed, and it is less than 12 hours until the next \ndose, the dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at the usual time. A double dose \nshould not be taken to compensate for a forgotten dose.\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any other Sodium-Glucose-Co-Transporter-2 (SGLT2) \ninhibitor, to any other Dipeptidyl-Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\n\nRare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been \nreported in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. In a number of cases, the \npresentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below \n14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). It is not known if DKA is more likely to occur with higher doses of \nempagliflozin.\n\nThe risk of DKA must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, \nanorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue or \nsleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms occur, \nregardless of blood glucose level.\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with empagliflozin should be \ndiscontinued immediately. \n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of\nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with empagliflozin may be restarted when the \nketone values are normal and the patient\u2019s condition has stabilised.\n\nBefore initiating empagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis\nshould be considered.\n\nPatients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g. \ntype 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or \npatients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or \nsevere dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin \nrequirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used \nwith caution in these patients. \n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and \nempagliflozin should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. Limited data from \nclinical trials suggest that DKA occurs with common frequency when patients with type 1 diabetes are\ntreated with SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nUse with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia\n\nEmpagliflozin and linagliptin as single agents showed an incidence of hypoglycaemia comparable to \nplacebo when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetics not known to cause \nhypoglycaemia (e.g. metformin, thiazolidinediones). When used in combination with antidiabetics \nknown to cause hypoglycaemia (e.g. sulphonylureas and/or insulin), the incidence of hypoglycaemia \nof both agents was increased (see section 4.8).\n\nThere are no data about the hypoglycaemic risk of Glyxambi when used with insulin and/or \n\n\n\n5\n\nsulphonylurea. However, caution is advised when Glyxambi is used in combination with antidiabetics. \nA dose reduction of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered (see section 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nAcute pancreatitis\n\nUse of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute \npancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. In a cardiovascular \nand renal safety study (CARMELINA) with median observation period of 2.2 years, adjudicated acute \npancreatitis was reported in 0.3% of patients treated with linagliptin and in 0.1% of patients treated \nwith placebo. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis.\n\nIf pancreatitis is suspected, Glyxambi should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, \nGlyxambi should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of \npancreatitis.\n\nMonitoring of renal function\n\nDue to the mechanism of action, the glycaemic efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal \nfunction (see sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2). Therefore, assessment of renal function is recommended:\n\uf0b7 prior to Glyxambi initiation and periodically during treatment, i.e. at least yearly,\n\uf0b7 prior to initiation of any concomitant medicinal product that may have a negative impact on \n\nrenal function.\n\nUse in patients with renal impairment\n\nIn patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl <60 mL/min, avoidance, dose adjustment \nor discontinuation of Glyxambi may be necessary (for details see section 4.2). Glyxambi should be \ndiscontinued when eGFR is persistently below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl is persistenly below \n45 mL/min. In patients with end-stage renal disease or in patients on dialysis, Glyxambi should not be \nused, as empagliflozin is not expected to be effective in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nUse in patients at risk for volume depletion\n\nBased on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying therapeutic \nglucosuria may lead to a modest decrease in blood pressure (see section 5.1). Therefore, caution \nshould be exercised in patients for whom an empagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose \na risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy (e.g. \nthiazide and loop diuretics, see also section 4.5) with a history of hypotension or patients aged \n75 years and older.\n\nIn case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of \nvolume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including \nhaematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving empagliflozin. Temporary \ninterruption of treatment with Glyxambi should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.\n\nUrinary tract infections\n\nIn Glyxambi clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections was overall similar between the \npatients treated with Glyxambi and the patients treated with empagliflozin or linagliptin. The \nfrequencies were comparable to the incidence of urinary tract infections in empagliflozin clinical trials \n(see section 4.8).\nIn a pool of placebo-controlled double-blind trials of 18 to 24 weeks duration, the overall frequency of \nurinary tract infection reported as adverse event was similar in patients treated with empagliflozin \n25 mg and placebo and higher in patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (see section 4.8). Post-\nmarketing cases of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis and urosepsis have \nbeen reported in patients treated with empagliflozin. Pyelonephritis and urosepsis were not reported \nfrom the clinical trials in patients treated with Glyxambi. However, temporary interruption of \n\n\n\n6\n\nGlyxambi should be considered in patients with complicated urinary tract infections.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\n\nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier\u2019s gangrene), \nhave been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but serious and \npotentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment.\n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier\u00b4s \ngangrene is suspected, Glyxambi should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics \nand surgical debridement) should be instituted.\n\nLower limb amputations\n\nAn increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in ongoing \nlong-term clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class \neffect. Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot-\ncare.\n\nHepatic injury\n\nCases of hepatic injury have been reported with empagliflozin in clinical trials. A causal relationship \nbetween empagliflozin and hepatic injury has not been established.\n\nCardiac failure\n\nExperience with empagliflozin in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II is limited, and there \nis no experience in clinical studies with empagliflozin in NYHA class III-IV. In the EMPA-REG \nOUTCOME study, 10.1 % of the patients were reported with cardiac failure at baseline. The reduction \nof cardiovascular death in these patients was consistent with the overall study population.\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\n\nDue to the mechanism of action of empagliflozin, patients taking Glyxambi will test positive for \nglucose in their urine.\n\nElevated haematocrit\n\nHaematocrit increase was observed with empagliflozin treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nElderly\n\nA higher risk of volume depletion adverse reactions were reported in patients aged 75 years and older, \ntreated with empagliflozin, especially at 25 mg/day (see section 4.8). Therefore, special attention \nshould be given to their volume intake in case of co-administered medicinal products which may lead \nto volume depletion (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors). Therapeutic experience is limited with Glyxambi \nin patients > 75 years of age, and, no experience is available in patients aged 85 years and older. \nInitiation of therapy with Glyxambi in this population is not recommended (see section 4.2).\n\nBullous pemphigoid\n\nBullous pemphigoid has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. In the CARMELINA study, \nbullous pemphigoid was reported in 0.2% of patients on treatment with linagliptin and in no patient on \nplacebo. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, Glyxambi should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo drug interaction studies have been performed with Glyxambi and other medicinal products; \nhowever, such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances. Based on results of \npharmacokinetic studies, no dose adjustment of Glyxambi is recommended when co-administered with \ncommonly prescribed medicinal products, except those mentioned below.\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\n\nInsulin and sulphonylureas\n\nInsulin and sulphonylureas may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin \nor sulphonylureas may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination \nwith Glyxambi (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nDiuretics\n\nEmpagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of \ndehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on empagliflozin\n\nEmpagliflozin is mainly excreted unchanged. A minor fraction is metabolised via uridine 5'-\ndiphosphoglucuronosyltransferases (UGT); therefore, a clinically relevant effect of UGT inhibitors on \nempagliflozin is not expected (see section 5.2). The effect of UGT induction on empagliflozin has not \nbeen studied. Co-administration with known inducers of UGT enzymes should be avoided because of \na risk of decreased efficacy of empagliflozin.\n\nCo-administration of empagliflozin with probenecid, an inhibitor of UGT enzymes and OAT3, \nresulted in a 26 % increase in peak empagliflozin plasma concentrations (Cmax) and a 53 % increase in \narea under the concentration-time curve (AUC). These changes were not considered to be clinically \nmeaningful.\n\nAn interaction study with gemfibrozil, an in vitro inhibitor of OAT3 and OATP1B1/1B3 transporters, \nshowed that empagliflozin Cmax increased by 15 % and AUC increased by 59 % following co-\nadministration. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.\n\nInhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 transporters by co-administration with rifampicin resulted in a 75 %\nincrease in Cmax and a 35 % increase in AUC of empagliflozin. These changes were not considered to \nbe clinically meaningful.\n\nInteraction studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin were not influenced by co-\nadministration with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, verapamil, \nramipril, simvastatin, torasemide and hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nEffects of empagliflozin on other medicinal products\n\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that empagliflozin had no clinically \nrelevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, \nsimvastatin, warfarin, ramipril, digoxin, diuretics and oral contraceptives.\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on linagliptin\n\nCo-administration of rifampicin decreased linagliptin exposure by 40 %, suggesting that the efficacy \nof linagliptin may be reduced when administered in combination with a strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) \n\n\n\n8\n\nor cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme CYP3A4 inducer, particularly if these are administed long-term\n(see section 5.2). Co-administration with other potent inducers of P-gp and CYP3A4, such as \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, has not been studied.\n\nCo-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of linagliptin and multiple 200 mg oral doses of ritonavir, \na potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, increased the AUC and Cmax of linagliptin \napproximately twofold and threefold, respectively. The unbound concentrations, which are usually less \nthan 1 % at the therapeutic dose of linagliptin, were increased 4 to 5-fold after co-administration with \nritonavir. Simulations of steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin with and without ritonavir \nindicated that the increase in exposure will be not associated with an increased accumulation. These \nchanges in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, \nclinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-glycoprotein / CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin \nwere not influenced by co-administration with metformin and glibenclamide.\n\nEffects of linagliptin on other medicinal products\n\nLinagliptin is a weak competitive and a weak to moderate mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP isozyme \nCYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes. It is not an inducer of CYP isozymes. Linagliptin \nis a P-glycoprotein substrate, and inhibits P-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin with low \npotency.\n\nLinagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide, \nsimvastatin, pioglitazone, warfarin, digoxin, empagliflozin or oral contraceptives providing in vivo\nevidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C8, P-gp and organic cationic transporter (OCT).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nThe effects of Glyxambi on pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility are not known. Effects related to \nthe individual active substances are described below.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of empagliflozin and linagliptin in pregnant women.\nAnimal studies show that empagliflozin and linagliptin cross the placenta during late gestation, but do \nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to early embryonic development with either \nempagliflozin or linagliptin (see section 5.3). Animal studies with empagliflozin have shown adverse \neffects on postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure it is preferable to avoid \nthe use of Glyxambi during pregnancy. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nNo data in humans are available on excretion of empagliflozin and linagliptin into milk. Available \nnon-clinical data in animals have shown excretion of empagliflozin and linagliptin in milk. A risk to \nnewborns or infants cannot be excluded. Glyxambi should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted with Glyxambi or with the individual \nactive substances. Non-clinical studies with empagliflozin and linagliptin as single agents do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nGlyxambi has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to\n\n\n\n9\n\ntake precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines, in particular when\nGlyxambi is used in combination with other antidiabetic medicinal products known to cause \nhypoglycaemia (e.g. insulin and analogues, sulphonylureas).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequent adverse reaction was urinary tract infection (7.5 % with Glyxambi 10 mg \nempagliflozin / 5 mg linagliptin and 8.5 % with Glyxambi 25 mg empagliflozin / 5 mg linagliptin) (see \nDescription of selected adverse reactions). The most serious adverse reactions were ketoacidosis\n(< 0.1%), pancreatitis (0.2%), hypersensitivity (0.6%), and hypoglycaemia (2.4%) (see section 4.4).\n\nOverall, the safety profile of Glyxambi was in line with the safety profiles of the individual active \nsubstances (empagliflozin and linagliptin). No additional adverse reactions were identified with \nGlyxambi.\n\nThe adverse reactions shown in the table below (see Table 1) are listed by system organ class and are \nbased on the safety profiles of empagliflozin and linagliptin monotherapy. The information about \nadverse reactions not reported in Glyxambi clinical trials is based on the experience from \nempagliflozin and linagliptin. Adverse reactions marked with an asterisk (*) are further discussed in \nsection \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d below.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nFrequency categories are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data).\n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions\n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction\n\nInfections and infestations Common Urinary tract infection1,* (including \npyelonephritis and urosepsis)4\n\nCommon\n\nCommon\nNot known\n\nVaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, \nbalanitis and other genital infections1,*\n\nNasopharyngitis2\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum \n(Fournier\u00b4s gangrene)#\n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity2\n\nUncommon Angioedema3,4, urticaria3,4\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nCommon\n\nCommon\nRare\n\nHypoglycaemia (when used with \nsulphonylurea or insulin)*\n\nThirst\nDiabetic ketoacidosis4,#\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCommon Cough2\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon\nRare\n\nPancreatitis2\n\nMouth ulceration3\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nCommon\nCommon\nNot known\n\nPruritus1\n\nRash3,4\n\nBullous pemphigoid2,a\n\nVascular disorders Uncommon Volume depletion1,*\n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common\nUncommon\n\nIncreased urination1,*\n\nDysuria1\n\nInvestigations Common\nCommon\nUncommon\nUncommon\nUncommon\n\nAmylase increased2\n\nLipase increased2\n\nHaematocrit increased1,5\n\nSerum lipids increased1,6\n\nBlood creatinine increased/Glomerular \nfiltration rate decreased1,*\n\n1 derived from empagliflozin experiences\n2 derived from linagliptin experiences\n3 derived from linagliptin postmarketing experience\n4 derived from empagliflozin postmarketing experience\n5 Mean changes from baseline in haematocrit were 3.3% and 4.2% for Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg and 25 mg/5 mg, respectively, \ncompared to 0.2% for placebo. In a clinical trial with empagliflozin, haematocrit values returned towards baseline values \nafter a follow-up period of 30 days after treatment stop.\n6 Mean percent increases from baseline for Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg and 25 mg/5 mg versus placebo, respectively, were total \ncholesterol 3.2% and 4.6% versus 0.5%; HDL-cholesterol 8.5% and 6.2% versus 0.4%; LDL-cholesterol 5.8% and 11.0% \nversus 3.3%; triglycerides -0.5% and 3.3% versus 6.4 %.\na In the CARMELINA study (see section 5.1), bullous pemphigoid was reported in 0.2% patients treated with linagliptin and \nin no patients treated with placebo.\n# see section 4.4\n* see subsection below for additional information\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nHypoglycaemia\n\nIn pooled clinical trials of Glyxambi in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control \non background metformin, the frequency of the reported hypoglycaemic events was 2.4 %. The \nincidence of confirmed hypoglycaemic events was low (< 1,5 %). There was no notable difference of \nthe incidence in patients treated with different dose strengths of Glyxambi compared to the treatment \nwith empagliflozin or linagliptin.\n\n\n\n11\n\nOne patient administered Glyxambi experienced a confirmed (investigator-defined), major \nhypoglycaemic event (defined as an event requiring assistance) in the active- or placebo-controlled \ntrials (overall frequency 0,1 %).\n\nBased on the experience with empagliflozin and linagliptin, an increase of the risk of hypoglycaemia \nis expected with the concomitant treatment of insulin and /or sulphonylurea (see section 4.4 and \ninformation below)\n\nHypoglycaemia with empagliflozin\n\nThe frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the background therapy in the respective studies and \nwas similar for empagliflozin and placebo as monotherapy, as add-on to metformin, and as add-on to \npioglitazone +/- metformin. The frequency of patients with hypoglycaemia was increased in patients \ntreated with empagliflozin compared to placebo when given as add-on to metformin plus \nsulphonylurea (empagliflozin 10 mg: 16.1 %, empagliflozin 25 mg: 11.5 %, placebo: 8.4 %), add-on \nto basal insulin +/- metformin and +/-sulphonylurea (empagliflozin 10 mg: 19.5 %, empagliflozin \n25 mg: 28.4 %, placebo: 20.6 % during initial 18 weeks treatment when insulin could not be adjusted; \nempagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg: 36.1 %, placebo 35.3 % over the 78 week trial), and add-on to MDI \ninsulin with or without metformin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 39.8 %, empagliflozin 25 mg: 41.3 %, \nplacebo: 37.2 % during initial 18 weeks treatment when insulin could not be adjusted; empagliflozin \n10 mg: 51.1 %, empagliflozin 25 mg: 57.7 %, placebo: 58 % over the 52-week trial).\n\nMajor hypoglycaemia with empagliflozin (events requiring assistance)\n\nThe frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was low (< 1 %) and similar for \nempagliflozin and placebo as monotherapy, as add-on to metformin +/- sulfonylurea, and as add-on to \npioglitazone +/- metformin.\n\nThe frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was increased in patients treated with \nempagliflozin compared to placebo when given as add-on to basal insulin +/- metformin and +/-\nsulphonylurea (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0 %, empagliflozin 25 mg: 1.3 %, placebo: 0 % during initial 18 \nweeks treatment when insulin could not be adjusted; empagliflozin 10 mg: 0 %, empagliflozin 25 mg: \n1.3 %, placebo 0 % over the 78-week trial), and add-on to MDI insulin with or without metformin \n(empagliflozin 10 mg: 1.6 %, empagliflozin 25 mg: 0.5 %, placebo: 1.6 % during initial 18 weeks \ntreatment when insulin could not be adjusted and over the 52-week trial).\n\nHypoglycaemia with linagliptin\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse event in clinical trials with linagliptin was hypoglycaemia \nobserved under the triple combination, linagliptin plus metformin plus sulphonylurea (22.9 % vs \n14.8 % in placebo).\n\nHypoglycaemias in the placebo-controlled studies (10.9 %; N=471) were mild (80 %; N=384), \nmoderate (16.6 %; N=78) or severe (1.9 %; N=9) in intensity.\n\nUrinary tract infection\n\nIn clinical trials with Glyxambi, there was no notable difference of the frequency of urinary tract \ninfections in patients treated with Glyxambi (Glyxambi 25 mg/5 mg: 8.5 %; Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg: \n7.5 %) compared to the patients treated with empagliflozin and linagliptin. The frequencies have been \ncomparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials (see also section 4.4).\n\nIn empagliflozin trials, the overall frequency of urinary tract infection was similar in patients treated \nwith empagliflozin 25 mg and placebo (7.0 % and 7.2 %), and higher in patients treated with \nempagliflozin 10 mg (8.8 %). Similar to placebo, urinary tract infection was reported more frequently \nfor empagliflozin in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. The \nintensity of urinary tract infections was similar to placebo for mild, moderate and severe intensity \n\n\n\n12\n\nreports. Urinary tract infection was reported more frequently in female patients treated with \nempagliflozin compared to placebo, but not in male patients.\n\nVaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infection\n\nIn clinical trials with Glyxambi, genital infections in patients treated with Glyxambi (Glyxambi \n25 mg/5 mg: 3.0 %; Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg: 2.5 %) were reported more frequently than for linagliptin \nbut less freqeuntly than for empagliflozin. Overall, the frequencies for Glyxambi have been \ncomparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials.\n\nIn empagliflozin trials, vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infections were \nreported more frequently for empagliflozin 10 mg (4.0 %) and empagliflozin 25 mg (3.9 %) compared \nto placebo (1.0 %). These infections were reported more frequently for empagliflozin compared to \nplacebo in female patients, and the difference in frequency was less pronounced in male patients. The \ngenital tract infections were mild and moderate in intensity, none was severe in intensity. \n\nIncreased urination\n\nIn clinical trials with Glyxambi, increased urination in patients treated with Glyxambi (Glyxambi \n25 mg/5 mg: 2.6 %; Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg: 1.4 %) was reported more frequently than for linagliptin \nand with similar frequency than for empagliflozin. Overall, the frequencies for Glyxambi have been \ncomparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials.\n\nIn clinical trials with empagliflozin, increased urination (including the predefined terms pollakiuria, \npolyuria, nocturia) was observed at higher frequencies in patients treated with empagliflozin\n(empagliflozin 10 mg: 3.5 %, empagliflozin 25 mg: 3.3 %) compared to placebo (1.4 %). Increased \nurination was mostly mild or moderate in intensity. The frequency of reported nocturia was \ncomparable between placebo and empagliflozin (< 1 %).\n\nVolume depletion\n\nIn clinical trials with Glyxambi, there was no notable difference in the frequency of volume depletion \nin patients treated with Glyxambi (Glyxambi 25 mg/5 mg: 0.4 %; Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg: 0.8 %)\ncompared to the patients treated with empagliflozin and linagliptin. The frequencies have been \ncomparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials.\n\nIn clinical trials with empagliflozin, the overall frequency of volume depletion (including the \npredefined terms blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, \ndehydration, hypotension, hypovolaemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) was similar in patients \ntreated with empagliflozin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.6 %, empagliflozin 25 mg: 0.4 %) and placebo \n(0.3 %). The frequency of volume depletion events was increased in patients 75 years and older treated \nwith empagliflozin 10 mg (2.3 %) or empagliflozin 25 mg (4.3 %) compared to placebo (2.1 %).\n\nBlood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased \n\nIn clinical trials with Glyxambi, the frequency of patients with increased blood creatinine (Glyxambi \n25 mg/5 mg: 0.4%; Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg: 0%) and decreased glomerular filtration rate (Glyxambi 25 \nmg/5 mg: 0.4%; Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg: 0.6%) has been comparable to those reported from the \nempagliflozin clinical trials.\n\nIn clinical trials with empagliflozin, the overall frequency of patients with increased blood creatinine \nand decreased glomerular filtration rate were similar between empagliflozin and placebo (blood \ncreatinine increased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.6%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0.1%, placebo 0.5%; glomerular \nfiltration rate decreased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0%, placebo 0.3%).\n\n\n\n13\n\nElderly\nIn clinical trials, nineteen patients 75 years or older were treated with Glyxambi. No patient was older \nthan 85 years. The safety profile of Glyxambi did not differ in the elderly. Based on empagliflozin \nexperiences, elderly patients may be at increased risk of volume depletion (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and \n5.2)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn controlled clinical studies single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin (equivalent to 32 times the \nhighest recommended daily dose) in healthy volunteers and multiple daily doses of up to 100 mg \nempagliflozin (equivalent to 4 times the highest recommended daily dose) in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes did not show any toxicity. Empagliflozin increased urine glucose excretion leading to an \nincrease in urine volume. The observed increase in urine volume was not dose-dependent. There is no \nexperience with doses above 800 mg in humans.\n\nDuring controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 600 mg linagliptin \n(equivalent to 120 times the recommended dose) were generally well tolerated. There is no experience \nwith doses above 600 mg in humans.\n\nTreatment\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring and institute clinical \nmeasures as required.\n\nThe removal of empagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. Linagliptin is not expected to be \neliminated to a therapeutically significant degree by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD19\n\nMechanism of action\n\nGlyxambi combines two antihyperglycaemic medicinal products with complementary mechanisms of \naction to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose \nco-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitor, and linagliptin, DPP-4 inhibitor.\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nEmpagliflozin is a reversible, highly potent (IC50 of 1.3 nmol) and selective competitive inhibitor of \nSGLT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into \nperipheral tissues and is 5,000 times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter \nresponsible for glucose absorption in the gut.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14\n\nSGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It \nis responsible, as the predominant transporter, for the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular \nfiltrate back into the circulation. In patients with type 2 diabetes and hyperglycaemia a higher amount \nof glucose is filtered and reabsorbed.\n\nEmpagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by reducing renal \nglucose re-absorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic\nmechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and GFR. Inhibition of SGLT2 in \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia leads to excess glucose excretion in the \nurine. In addition, initiation of empagliflozin increases excretion of sodium resulting in osmotic \ndiuresis and reduced intravascular volume.\n\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first \ndose of empagliflozin and was continuous over the 24-hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose \nexcretion was maintained at the end of the 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately \n78 g/day. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose \nlevels in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nEmpagliflozin improves both fasting and post prandial plasma glucose levels. The mechanism of \naction of empagliflozin is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway and this contributes to \na low risk of hypoglycaemia. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including \nHomeostasis Model Assessment \u03b2 (HOMA \u03b2) was noted. In addition, urinary glucose excretion \ntriggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed \nwith empagliflozin is accompanied by diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate \nreduction of blood pressure. The glucosuria, natriuresis and osmotic diuresis observed with \nempagliflozin may contribute to the improvement in cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nLinagliptin\n\nLinagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 an enzyme which is involved in the inactivation of the \nincretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP (glucagon-like peptide\u00ac1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic \npolypeptide). These hormones are rapidly degraded by the enzyme DPP-4. Both incretin hormones are \ninvolved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretins are secreted at a low basal \nlevel throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin \nbiosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood \nglucose levels. Furthermore GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, \nresulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Linagliptin binds very effectively to DPP-4 in a \nreversible manner and thus leads to a sustained increase and a prolongation of active incretin levels. \nLinagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion thus \nresulting in an overall improvement in the glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4 \nand exhibits a > 10,000-fold selectivity versus DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nA total of 2,173 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control were treated \nin clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Glyxambi; 1,005 patients were treated with \nGlyxambi 10 mg empagliflozin/5 mg linagliptin or 25 mg empagliflozin/5 mg linagliptin. In clinical \ntrials, patients were treated for up to 24 or 52 weeks.\n\nGlyxambi added to metformin\n\nIn a factorial design study patients inadequately controlled on metformin were treated for 24-weeks \nwith Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg, Glyxambi 25 mg/5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg or \nlinagliptin 5 mg. The treatment with Glyxambi resulted in statistically significant improvements in \nHbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to linagliptin 5 mg and also compared to \nempagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg. Glyxambi also provided statistically significant improvements in body \n\n\n\n15\n\nweight compared to linagliptin 5 mg. \n\nTable 2 Efficacy parameters in clinical study comparing Glyxambi to individual active substances \nas add-on therapy in patients inadequately controlled on metformin\n\nGlyxambi\n25 mg / 5 mg\n\nGlyxambi\n10 mg / 5 mg\n\nEmpagliflozin \n25 mg\n\nEmpagliflozin \n10 mg\n\nLinagliptin \n5 mg\n\nPrimary endpoint: HbA1c ( %) \u2013 24 weeks\n\nNumber of patients analysed 134 135 140 137 128\n\nBaseline mean (SE) 7.90 (0.07) 7.95 (0.07) 8.02 (0.07) 8.00 (0.08) 8.02 (0.08)\n\nChange from baseline at \nweek 241:\n- adjusted mean2 (SE)\n\n-1.19 (0.06) -1.08 (0.06) -0.62 (0.06) -0.66 (0.06) -0.70 (0.06)\n\nComparison vs. empagliflozin1:\n- adjusted mean2 (SE)\n- 95.0 % CI\n- p-value\n\nvs. 25 mg\n-0.58 (0.09)\n-0.75, -0.41\n\n<0.0001\n\nvs. 10 mg\n-0.42 (0.09)\n-0.59, -0.25\n\n<0.0001\n\n-- -- --\n\nComparison vs. linagliptin 5 mg1:\n- adjusted mean2 (SE)\n- 95.0 % CI\n- p-value\n\n-0.50 (0.09)\n-0.67, -0.32\n\n<0.0001\n\n-0.39 (0.09)\n-0.56, -0.21\n\n<0.0001\n\n-- -- --\n\n1 Last observation (prior to glycaemic rescue ) carried forward (LOCF)\n2 Mean adjusted for baseline value and stratification \n\nIn a pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline HbA1c greater or equal than 8.5 %, the reduction \nfrom baseline in HbA1c at 24 weeks with Glyxambi 25 mg/5 mg was -1.8 % (p<0.0001 versus \nlinagliptin 5 mg, p<0.001 versus empagliflozin 25 mg) and with Glyxambi 10 mg/ 5 mg -1.6 %\n(p<0.01 versus linagliptin 5 mg, n.s. versus empagliflozin 10 mg).\n\nOverall, the effects on HbA1c reduction observed at 24 weeks were sustained at week 52.\n\nEmpagliflozin in patients inadequately controlled on metformin and linagliptin \n\nIn patients inadequately controlled on maximally tolerated doses of metformin, open label linagliptin \n5 mg was added for 16 weeks.

A total of 7020 patients were treated \n(empagliflozin 10 mg: 2345, empagliflozin 25 mg: 2342, placebo: 2333) and followed for a median of \n3.1 years. The mean age was 63 years, the mean HbA1c was 8.1 %, and 71.5 % were male. At \nbaseline, 74 % of patients were being treated with metformin, 48 % with insulin, and 43 % with a \nsulfonylurea. About half of the patients (52.2 %) had an eGFR of 60-90 ml/min/1.73 m2, 17.8 % of \n45-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 7.7 % of 30-45 ml/min/1.73 m2.\n\nAt week 12, an adjusted mean (SE) improvement in HbA1c when compared to baseline of 0.11 % \n(0.02) in the placebo group, 0.65 % (0.02) and 0.71 % (0.02) in the empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg \ngroups was observed. After the first 12 weeks glycaemic control was optimized independent of \ninvestigative treatment. Therefore the effect was attenuated at week 94, with an adjusted mean (SE) \nimprovement in HbA1c of 0.08 % (0.02) in the placebo group, 0.50 % (0.02) and 0.55 % (0.02) in the \nempagliflozin 10 and 25 mg groups.\n\nEmpagliflozin was superior in preventing the primary combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, \nnonfatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke, as compared with placebo. The treatment effect \nwas driven by a significant reduction in cardiovascular death with no significant change in non-fatal \nmyocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. The reduction of cardiovascular death was comparable for \nempagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg and confirmed by an improved overall survival (see Table 5).\n\n\n\n18\n\nTable 5 Treatment effect for the primary composite endpoint, its components and mortalitya\n\nPlacebo Empagliflozinb\n\nN 2333 4687\nTime to first event of CV death, non-fatal MI, \nor non-fatal stroke N (%)\n\n282 (12.1) 490 (10.5)\n\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95.02% CI)* 0.86 (0.74, 0.99)\np\u2212value for superiority 0.0382\n\nCV Death N (%) 137 (5.9) 172 (3.7)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 0.62 (0.49, 0.77)\np-value <0.0001\n\nNon-fatal MI N (%) 121 (5.2) 213 (4.5)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 0.87 (0.70, 1.09)\np\u2212value 0.2189\n\nNon-fatal stroke N (%) 60 (2.6) 150 (3.2)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 1.24 (0.92, 1.67)\np\u2212value 0.1638\n\nAll-cause mortality N (%) 194 (8.3) 269 (5.7)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 0.68 (0.57, 0.82)\np-value <0.0001\n\nNon-CV mortality N (%) 57 (2.4) 97 (2.1)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 0.84 (0.60, 1.16)\n\nCV = cardiovascular, MI = myocardial infarction\na Treated set (TS), i.e. patients who had received at least one dose of study drug\nb Pooled doses of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg\n* Since data from the trial were included in an interim analysis, a two-sided 95.02% confidence interval applied which \ncorresponds to a p-value of less than 0.0498 for significance.\n\nThe efficacy for preventing cardiovascular mortality has not been conclusively established in patients \nusing empagliflozin concomitantly with DPP-4 inhibitors or in Black patients because the \nrepresentation of these groups in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study was limited.\n\nHeart failure requiring hospitalization \n\nIn the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, empagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure requiring \nhospitalization compared with placebo (empagliflozin 2.7 %; placebo 4.1 %; HR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.50, \n0.85).\n\nNephropathy\n\nIn the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, for time to first nephropathy event, the HR was 0.61 (95 % CI \n0.53, 0.70) for empagliflozin (12.7 %) vs placebo (18.8 %).\n\nIn addition, empagliflozin showed a higher (HR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.40, 2.37) occurrence of sustained \nnormo- or micro-albuminuria (49.7 %) in patients with baseline macro-albuminuria compared with \nplacebo (28.8 %).\n\nLinagliptin cardiovascular and renal safety (CARMELINA) study\n\nThe double-blind, placebo-controlled CARMELINA study evaluated the cardiovascular and renal \nsafety of linagliptin versus placebo as adjunct to standard care therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes \nand with increased CV risk evidenced by a history of established macrovascular or renal disease. A \ntotal of 6979 patients were treated (linagliptin 5 mg: 3494, placebo: 3485) and followed for a median \nof 2.2 years. The study population included 1211 (17.4 %) patients \u2265 75 years of age, the mean HbA1c\nwas 8.0 %, 63 % were male. Approximately 19 % of the population had an eGFR of \n45-60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 28 % of 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 15 % of <30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2.\n\nLinagliptin did not increase the risk of the combined endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial \ninfarction or non-fatal stroke (MACE-3) [HR=1.02; (95 % CI 0.89, 1.17); p=0.0002 for non-\n\n\n\n19\n\ninferiority], or the risk of combined endpoint of renal death, ESRD, 40% or more sustained decrease in \neGFR [HR=1.04; (95 % CI 0.89, 1.22)]. In analyses for albuminuria progression (change from \nnormoalbuminuria to micro-or macroalbuminuria, or from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria) the \nestimated hazard ratio was 0.86 (95 % CI 0.78, 0.95) for linagliptin versus placebo. In addition, \nlinagliptin did not increase the risk of hospitalization for heart failure [HR=0.90; (95 % CI 0.74, \n1.08)]. No increased risk of CV death or all-cause mortality was observed. \n\nSafety data from this study was in line with previous known safety profile of linagliptin.\n\nLinagliptin cardiovascular safety (CAROLINA) study\n\nThe double-blind parallel group CAROLINA study evaluated the cardiovascular safety of linagliptin \nversus glimepiride as adjunct to standard care therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and with \nincreased CV risk. A total of 6033 patients were treated (linagliptin 5 mg: 3023, glimepiride 1 mg to \n4 mg: 3010) and followed for a median of 6.25 years. The mean age was 64 years, the mean HbA1c \nwas 7.15 %, and 60 % were male. Approximately 19 % of the population had an eGFR\n<60 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\nThe study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary cardiovascular endpoint which \nwas a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction \n(MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE). Linagliptin did not increase the risk of the combined endpoint \nof CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (MACE-3) [Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.98; \n(95 % CI 0.84, 1.14); p<0.0001 for non-inferiority], when added to standard of care in adult patients \nwith type 2 diabetes with increased CV risk compared to glimepiride (see Table 6). \n\nTable 6 Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality by treatment group in the \nCAROLINA study\n\nLinagliptin 5mg Glimepiride (1-4mg) Hazard Ratio\nNumber of \nSubjects \n\n(%)\n\nIncidence \nRate per \n\n1000 PY*\n\nNumber of \nSubjects (%)\n\nIncidence \nRate per \n\n1000 PY*\n\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber of patients 3023 3010\nPrimary CV \ncomposite \n(Cardiovascular \ndeath, non-fatal MI, \nnon-fatal stroke)\n\n356 (11.8) 20.7 362 (12.0) 21.2 0.98 (0.84, \n1.14)**\n\nAll-cause mortality 308 (10.2) 16.8 336 (11.2) 18.4 0.91 (0.78,1.06)\nCV death 169 (5.6) 9.2 168 (5.6) 9.2 1.00 (0.81, 1.24)\nHospitalization for \nheart failure (HHF)\n\n112 (3.7) 6.4 92 (3.1) 5.3 1.21 (0.92, 1.59)\n\n* PY=patient years\n** Test on non-inferiority to demonstrate that the upper bound of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio is less than 1.3\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with\nGlyxambi in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n\n\n20\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of empagliflozin and linagliptin in Glyxambi are equivalent to the \nbioavailability of empagliflozin and linagliptin when administered as individual tablets.The \npharmacokinetics of empagliflozin and linagliptin as single agents have been extensively characterized \nin healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetics were generally similar in \nhealthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nGlyxambi showed a similar food effect as the individual active substances. Glyxambi can therefore be \ntaken with or without food.\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations \noccurring at a median tmax of 1.5 hours post dose. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a \nbiphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase. The steady state \nmean plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax were 1,870 nmol.h and \n259 nmol/L with empagliflozin 10 mg and 4,740 nmol.h and 687 nmol/L with empagliflozin 25 mg \nonce daily. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose proportional manner. The single \ndose and steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin were similar suggesting linear \npharmacokinetics with respect to time.\nAdministration of empagliflozin 25 mg after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in\nslightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16 % and Cmax by approximately 37 %\ncompared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not\nconsidered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L based on the population \npharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy \nvolunteers, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 37 % and plasma protein binding was \n86 %.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nNo major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant \nmetabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-, 3-, and 6-O-glucuronide). Systemic exposure of \neach metabolite was less than 10 % of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggest that the \nprimary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-\ndiphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8 and UGT1A9.\n\nElimination\n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent terminal elimination half life of \nempagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 hours and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/hour. The inter \nsubject and residual variabilities for empagliflozin oral clearance were 39.1 % and 35.8 %, \nrespectively. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were \nreached by the fifth dose. Consistent with the half life, up to 22 % accumulation, with respect to \nplasma AUC, was observed at steady state.\n\nFollowing administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy volunteers, approximately \n96 % of the drug-related radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (41 %) or urine (54 %). The majority \nof drug-related radioactivity recovered in faeces was unchanged parent drug and approximately half of \ndrug related radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged parent drug.\n\n\n\n21\n\nLinagliptin\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration of a 5 mg dose to healthy volunteers or patients, linagliptin was rapidly \nabsorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1.5 hours post-dose.\n\nAfter once daily dosing of 5 mg linagliptin, steady-state plasma concentrations are reached by the third \ndose. Plasma AUC of linagliptin increased approximately 33 % following 5 mg doses at steady-state \ncompared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin \nAUC were small (12.6 % and 28.5 %, respectively). Due to the concentration dependent binding of \nlinagliptin to DPP-4, the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on total exposure is not linear; indeed \ntotal plasma AUC of linagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner while unbound \nAUC increases in a roughly dose-proportional manner.\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30 %. Co-administration of a high-fat meal \nwith linagliptin prolonged the time to reach Cmax by 2 hours and lowered Cmax by 15 % but no \ninfluence on AUC0-72h was observed. No clinically relevant effect of Cmax and Tmax changes is \nexpected; therefore linagliptin may be administered with or without food.\n\nThe steady state plasma AUC\u03c4,ss and Cmax,ss concentrations of linagliptin were 153 nmol*hr/L and 12.9 \nnmol/L for linagliptin 5 mg once daily for 7 days.\n\nDistribution\n\nAs a result of tissue binding, the mean apparent volume of distribution at steady-state following a \nsingle 5 mg intravenous dose of linagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 1,110 litres, indicating \nthat linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is \nconcentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99 % at 1 nmol/L to 75-89 % at \u226530 nmol/L, \nreflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At high \nconcentrations, where DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70-80 % of linagliptin was bound to other plasma \nproteins than DPP-4, hence 30-20 % were unbound in plasma.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nFollowing a [14C] linagliptin oral 10 mg dose, approximately 5 % of the radioactivity was excreted in \nurine. Metabolism plays a subordinate role in the elimination of linagliptin. One main metabolite with \na relative exposure of 13.3 % of linagliptin at steady-state was detected which was found to be \npharmacologically inactive and thus to not contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of \nlinagliptin.\n\nElimination\n\nPlasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in a triphasic manner with a long terminal half-life \n(terminal half-life for linagliptin more than 100 hours) that is mostly related to the saturable, tight \nbinding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and does not contribute to the accumulation of the medicinal product. \nThe effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of \nmultiple doses of 5 mg linagliptin, is approximately 12 hours.\nFollowing administration of an oral [14C] linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85 % of\nthe administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (80 %) or urine (5 %) within 4 days of dosing. \nRenal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 mL/min.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nIn patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and \n\n\n\n22\n\npatients with kidney failure or end stage renal disease (ESRD), AUC of empagliflozin increased by \napproximately 18 %, 20 %, 66 %, and 48 %, respectively compared to subjects with normal renal \nfunction. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment \nand kidney failure/ESRD compared to patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of \nempagliflozin were roughly 20 % higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as \ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed \nthat the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in eGFR leading to an \nincrease in drug exposure (see section 4.2).\n\nLinagliptin\n\nA multiple-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin (5 mg \ndose) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal insufficiency compared to subjects with normal \nrenal function. The study included patients with renal insufficiency classified on the basis of creatinine \nclearance as mild (50 to <80 mL/min), moderate (30 to <50 mL/min), and severe (<30 mL/min), as \nwell as patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. In addition patients with T2DM and severe renal \nimpairment (<30 mL/min) were compared to T2DM patients with normal renal function.\nUnder steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was \ncomparable to healthy subjects. In moderate renal impairment, a moderate increase in exposure of \nabout 1.7-fold was observed compared with control. Exposure in T2DM patients with severe RI was \nincreased by about 1.4-fold compared to T2DM patients with normal renal function. Steady-state \npredictions for AUC of linagliptin in patients with ESRD indicated comparable exposure to that of \npatients with moderate or severe renal impairment. In addition, linagliptin is not expected to be \neliminated to a therapeutically significant degree by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nEmpagliflozin\nIn patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh classification), mean \nAUC and Cmax of empagliflozin increased (AUC by 23 %, 47 %, 75 % and Cmax by 4 %, 23 %,48 %) \ncompared to subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 4.2). \n\nLinagliptin\nIn non-diabetic patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic insufficiency (according to the Child-\nPugh classification), mean AUC and Cmax of linagliptin were similar to healthy subjects following \nadministration of multiple 5 mg doses of linagliptin.\n\nBody mass index\n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for Glyxambi based on body mass index. Body mass index had no \nclinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin or linagliptin based on population \npharmacokinetic analysis.\n\nGender\n\nGender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin or linagliptin based \non population pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\nRace\n\nNo clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin and linagliptin were seen in \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis and dedicated phase I studies.\n\nElderly\n\nAge did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin or \n\n\n\n23\n\nlinagliptin based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had \ncomparable plasma concentrations of linagliptin compared to younger subjects.\n\nPaediatric patients\n\nEmpagliflozin\nA paediatric Phase 1 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin\n(5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg) in children and adolescents \u226510 to <18 years of age with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. The observed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those \nfound in adult subjects.\n\nLinagliptin\nA paediatric Phase 2 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 1 mg and 5 mg \nlinagliptin in children and adolescents \u226510 to <18 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The \nobserved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those found in adult \nsubjects. Linagliptin 5 mg showed superiority over 1 mg with regard to trough DPP-4 inhibition (72% \nvs 32%, p=0.0050) and a numerically larger reduction with regard to adjusted mean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c (-0.63% vs -0.48%, n.s.). Due to the limited nature of the data set the results should \nbe interpreted cautiously.\n\nDrug interactions\n\nNo drug interaction studies have been performed with Glyxambi and other medicinal products; \nhowever, such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances.\n\nIn vitro assessment of empagliflozin\n\nBased on in vitro studies, empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. \nEmpagliflozin does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. Drug-drug \ninteractions involving the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly \nadministered substrates of these enzymes are therefore considered unlikely.\n\nIn vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is \nglucuronidation by uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and \nUGT2B7.\n\nEmpagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but \nnot Organic Anion Transporter 1 (OAT1) and Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2). Empagliflozin is \na substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).\n\nEmpagliflozin does not inhibit P-gp at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is\nconsidered unlikely to cause interactions with medicinal products that are P-gp substrates. Co-\nadministration of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, with empagliflozin resulted in a 6 % increase in AUC and \n14 % increase in Cmax of digoxin. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.\n\nEmpagliflozin does not inhibit human uptake transporters such as OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3\nin vitro at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, as such, drug-drug interactions with\nsubstrates of these uptake transporters are considered unlikely.\n\nIn vitro assessment of linagliptin\n\nLinagliptin was a substrate for OATP8-, OCT2-, OAT4-, OCTN1- and OCTN2, suggesting a possible \nOATP8-mediated hepatic uptake, OCT2-mediated renal uptake and OAT4-, OCTN1- and OCTN2-\nmediated renal secretion and reabsorption of linagliptin in vivo. OATP2, OATP8, OCTN1, OCT1 and \nOATP2 activities were slightly to weakly inhibited by linagliptin.\n\n\n\n24\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nGeneral toxicity studies in rats up to 13 weeks were performed with the combination of empagliflozin \nand linagliptin. \nFocal areas of hepatocellular necrosis were found in the combination groups at \u226515: 30 mg/kg \nlinagliptin: empagliflozin (3.8 times the clinical exposure for linagliptin and 7.8 times the clinical \nexposure for empagliflozin) as well as in the group treated with empagliflozin alone but not in the \ncontrol group. The clinical relevance of this finding remains uncertain.\nAt exposures sufficiently in excess of exposure in humans after therapeutic doses, the combination of \nempagliflozin and linagliptin was not teratogenic and did not show maternal toxicity. Adverse effects \non renal development were not observed after administration of empagliflozin alone, linagliptin alone \nor after administration of the combined products.\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nNon clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity, fertility and early embryonic development.\n\nIn long-term toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, signs of toxicity were observed at exposures greater \nthan or equal to 10-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin. Most toxicity was consistent with \nsecondary pharmacology related to urinary glucose loss and electrolyte imbalances including \ndecreased body weight and body fat, increased food consumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased \nserum glucose and increases in other serum parameters reflective of increased protein metabolism and \ngluconeogenesis, urinary changes such as polyuria and glucosuria, and microscopic changes including \nmineralisation in kidney and some soft and vascular tissues. Microscopic evidence of the effects of \nexaggerated pharmacology on the kidney observed in some species included tubular dilatation, and \ntubular and pelvic mineralisation at approximately 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin \nassociated with the 25 mg dose.\n\nIn a 2 year carcinogenicity study, empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female \nrats up to the highest dose of 700 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 72 times the \nmaximal clinical AUC exposure to empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment related benign vascular \nproliferative lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node were observed at the highest dose, \nbut not at 300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 26 times the maximal clinical exposure \nto empagliflozin. Interstitial cell tumours in the testes were observed with a higher incidence in rats at \n300 mg/kg/day and above, but not at 100 mg/kg/day which corresponds to approximately 18 times the \nmaximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. Both tumours are common in rats and are unlikely to be \nrelevant to humans.\n\nEmpagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female mice at doses up to \n1,000 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 62-times the maximal clinical exposure to \nempagliflozin. Empagliflozin induced renal tumours in male mice at 1,000 mg/kg/day, but not at \n300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 11-times the maximal clinical exposure to \nempagliflozin. The mode of action for these tumours is dependent on the natural predisposition of the \nmale mouse to renal pathology and a metabolic pathway not reflective of humans. The male mouse \nrenal tumours are considered not relevant to humans.\n\nAt exposures sufficiently in excess of exposure in humans after therapeutic doses, empagliflozin had \nno adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development. Empagliflozin administered during the \nperiod of organogenesis was not teratogenic. Only at maternally toxic doses, empagliflozin also \ncaused bent limb bones in the rat and increased embryofetal loss in the rabbit.\n\nIn pre- and postnatal toxicity studies with empagliflozin in rats, reduced weight gain in offspring was \nobserved at maternal exposures approximately 4 times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. \nNo such effect was seen at systemic exposure equal to the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. \nThe relevance of this finding to humans is unclear.\n\n\n\n25\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study in the rat, when empagliflozin was administered from postnatal day 21 \nuntil postnatal day 90, non-adverse, minimal to mild renal tubular and pelvic dilation in juvenile rats \nwas seen only at 100 mg/kg/day, which approximates 11-times the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg. \nThese findings were absent after a 13 weeks drug-free recovery period.\n\nLinagliptin\n\nNon clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity, fertility and early embryonic development.\n\nIn long-term toxicity studies in rodents and Cynomolgus monkeys, signs of toxicity were observed at \nexposures greater than 300-times the clinical dose of linagliptin. \n\nLiver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are the principal target organs of toxicity in mice and rats. At \nexposures greater than 1,500-times the clinical exposure, side effects on reproductive organs, thyroid \nand the lymphoid organs were seen in rats. Strong pseudo-allergic reactions were observed in dogs at \nmedium doses, secondarily causing cardiovascular changes, which were considered dog-specific. \nLiver, kidneys, stomach, reproductive organs, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes were target organs of \ntoxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys at more than 450-times the clinical exposure. At more than \n100-times clinical exposure, irritation of the stomach was the major finding in monkeys.\n\nOral 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or \nmale mice. A significantly higher incidence of malignant lymphomas only in female mice at the \nhighest dose (>200-times human exposure) is not considered relevant for humans. Based on these \nstudies there is no concern for carcinogenicity in humans.\n\nLinagliptin had no adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development at exposures greater \nthan 900-times the clinical exposure. Linagliptin administered during the period of organogenesis was \nnot teratogenic. Only at maternally toxic doses, linagliptin caused a slight retardation of skeletal \nossification in the rat and increased embryofoetal loss in the rabbit.\n\nIn the pre- and postnatal toxicity study with linagliptin in rats, reduced weight gain in offspring was \nobserved at maternal exposures approximately 1,500-times the maximal clinical exposure to \nlinagliptin. No such effect was seen at systemic exposure 49-times the maximal clinical exposure to \nlinagliptin.\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Glyxambi is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Glyxambi\n3. How to take Glyxambi\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Glyxambi\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Glyxambi is and what it is used for\n\nGlyxambi is an anti-diabetic medicine that contains two active substances called empagliflozin and \nlinagliptin:\n\uf0b7 Empagliflozin works by blocking a protein in the kidneys called sodium glucose co-transporter \n\n2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 prevents glucose from being excreted in urine by absorbing glucose back \ninto the bloodstream as blood is being filtered in the kidneys. By blocking this protein, the \nmedicine causes glucose (blood sugar), sodium (salt) and water to be removed via the urine. \nThis helps to lower blood glucose levels, which are too high because of your type 2 diabetes.\n\n\uf0b7 Linagliptin works in a different way, namely by enabling the pancreas to produce more insulin\nto lower blood glucose levels. It does this by blocking a protein called DPP-4.\n\nGlyxambi is added to metformin and/or sulphonylurea (SU) to treat type 2 diabetes in adult patients \nwhose diabetes cannot be controlled when treated with metformin and/or sulphonylurea in \ncombination with empagliflozin, or when treated with metformin and/or sulphonylurea in combination \nwith linagliptin.\nGlyxambi can also be used as an alternative to taking both empagliflozin and linagliptin as single \ntablets. In this case, do not continue taking any one of those tablets separately, if your are taking this \nmedicine.\n\nIt is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as recommended by your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse.\n\n\n\n40\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a condition that comes from both your genes and your lifestyle. If you have type 2 \ndiabetes, your pancreas may not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood, and \nyour body is unable to use its own insulin effectively. This results in high levels of sugar in your \nblood, which can lead to medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and poor \ncirculation in your limbs.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Glyxambi\n\nDo not take Glyxambi:\n- if you are allergic to empagliflozin, linagliptin, any other SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g. dapagliflozin, \n\ncanagliflozin), any other DPP-4 inhibitor (e.g. sitagliptin, vildagliptin), or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, before taking this medicine, and during treatment:\n\uf0b7 about what you can do to prevent dehydration\n\uf0b7 if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin). Glyxambi should not be \n\nused to treat type 1 diabetes.\n\uf0b7 if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, \n\nfast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, \na sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat. Contact a \ndoctor or the nearest hospital straight away as these symptoms could be a sign of \u201cdiabetic \nketoacidosis\u201d \u2013 a rare, but serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get with \ndiabetes because of increased levels of \u201cketone bodies\u201d in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The \nrisk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive\nalcohol consumption, dehydration or sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of \ninsulin due to major surgery or serious illness.\n\n\uf0b7 if you are taking other anti-diabetic medicines known as \u201csulphonylurea\u201d (e.g. glimepiride, \nglipizide) and/or insulin. Your doctor may want to reduce your dose of these medicines when \nyou take them together with Glyxambi, in order to avoid too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).\n\n\uf0b7 if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas.\n\uf0b7 if you have serious kidney problems. Your doctor may ask you to take a different medicine.\n\uf0b7 if you are 75 years old or older, as increased passing of urine due to the medicine may affect \n\nfluid balance in your body and increase your risk of dehydration.For possible signs of \ndehydration, see section 4.\n\n\uf0b7 if you are 75 years old or older as starting this medicine above 75 years is not recommended .\n\nContact your doctor if you experience any of the following during treatment with Glyxambi:\n\uf0b7 if you develop symptoms of acute pancreatitis, like persistent, severe abdominal pain. Possible \n\nsigns are listed in section 4, \u2018Possible side effects\u2019. Your doctor may need to change your \ntreatment.\n\n\uf0b7 if you are being sick, have diarrhoea or fever, or if you are not able to eat or drink. These \nconditions can cause dehydration. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Glyxambi until you \nrecover, to prevent loss of too much body fluid.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask \nyou to stop taking Glyxambi until you have recovered.\n\n\uf0b7 if you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous \npemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to stop Glyxambi.\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling \ngenerally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening \ninfection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier\u00b4s gangrene which destroys the tissue \nunder the skin. Fournier\u2019s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\n\n\n41\n\nFoot care\nLike for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice \nregarding foot care given by your health care professional.\n\nKidney function\nBefore you start treatment with Glyxambi and regularly during treatment, your doctor will check how \nwell your kidneys are working.\n\nUrine glucose\nBecause of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are taking this \nmedicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years, because it has not \nbeen studied in these patients.\n\nOther medicines and Glyxambi\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.\nIn particular, you should tell your doctor if you are using the following medicines:\n\uf0b7 other anti-diabetic medicines, such as insulin or a sulphonylurea. Your doctor may want to \n\nlower the dose of these other medicines, to prevent your blood sugar levels from getting too \nlow.\n\n\uf0b7 medicines used to remove water from your body (diuretics). Your doctor may ask you to stop \ntaking Glyxambi.\n\n\uf0b7 medicines that might have an effect on the break down of empagliflozin or linagliptin in your \nbody such as rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis) or certain medicines used to \ntreat seizures (such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin). The effect of Glyxambi may \nbe reduced.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine.\nIt is not known whether Glyxambi is harmful to the unborn child. As a precautionary measure it is \npreferrable to avoid the use of this medicine during pregnancy.\nIt is not known whether the active substances of Glyxambi pass into human breast milk. Do not use \nthis medicine if you are breast-feeding.\n\nIt is not known wheather Glyxambi has an effect on the fertility in humans.\n\nDriving and using machines\nGlyxambi has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nTaking this medicine in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin, can cause your blood sugar levels \nto drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating and changes\nin vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or use any tools or \nmachines, if you experience any of these symptoms while taking Glyxambi.\n\n3. How to take Glyxambi\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist\nif you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\nThe usual starting dose is 10 mg empagliflozin plus 5 mg linagliptin once a day. For this dose \nGlyxambi is available as 10 mg/5 mg film coated tablets.\n\n\n\n42\n\nYour doctor will decide whether you need to increase your dose to one film-coated tablet of Glyxambi \n25 mg/5 mg (25 mg empagliflozin plus 5 mg linagliptin) once a day. If you already take 25 mg \nempagliflozin and 5 mg linagliptin as separate tablets and you switch to Glyxambi, you can start \ndirectly with Glyxambi 25 mg/5 mg.\n\nRenal impairment:\nTalk to your doctor if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may limit your dose or decide to use an \nalternative medicine.\n\nHepatic impairment:\nTalk to your doctor in case you suffer from severe hepatic impairment. Glyxambi is not recommended \nand your doctor may decide to use an alternative medicine.\n\nElderly:\nThere is very little experience in patients aged 75 years or older. Treatment with Glyxambi should not \nbe started in patients above the age of 75.\n\nTaking this medicine\n\uf0b7 Swallow the tablet whole with water.\n\uf0b7 You can take Glyxambi with or without food.\n\uf0b7 You can take the tablet at any time of the day. However, try to take it at the same time each day.\n\nThis will help you to remember to take it.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe Glyxambi together with another anti-diabetic medicine. Remember to take \nall medicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best results for your health.\n\nDiet and exercise can help your body to use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the diet \nand exercise program recommended by your doctor during treatment with this medicine.\n\nIf you take more Glyxambi than you should\nIf you take more of this medicine than you should, immediately talk to a doctor or go to a hospital. \nTake the medicine pack with you.\n\nIf you forget to take Glyxambi\nWhat to do if you forget to take a tablet depends on how long it is until your next dose:\n\uf0b7 If it is 12 hours or more until your next dose, take Glyxambi as soon as you remember. Then \n\ntake your next dose at the usual time.\n\uf0b7 If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at \n\nthe usual time.\n\uf0b7 Do not take a double dose of this medicine to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Glyxambi\nDo not stop taking this medicine without first consulting your doctor. Your blood sugar levels may \nincrease when you stop taking Glyxambi.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\n\n\n43\n\nContact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away if you have any of the following side \neffects:\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis, seen rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\nThese are the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (see also section 2, \u2018Warnings and precautions\u2019):\n\u2013 increased levels of \u201cketone bodies\u201d in your urine or blood\n\u2013 rapid weight loss\n\u2013 feeling sick or being sick\n\u2013 stomach pain\n\u2013 excessive thirst\n\u2013 fast and deep breathing\n\u2013 confusion\n\u2013 unusual sleepiness or tiredness\n\u2013 a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your \n\nurine or sweat.\n\nThis may occur regardless of blood glucose level. Your doctor may decide to temporarily or \npermanently stop your treatment with this medicine.\n\nContact your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects:\n\nAllergic reactions, seen uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\nThis medicine may cause allergic reactions, which may be serious, including hives (urticaria) and \nswelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing \n(angioedema).\n\nInflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), seen uncommonly \nThis medicine may cause pancreatitis, which usually shows as persistent, severe abdominal (stomach) \npain that might reach through to your back, often accompanied by feeling sick or being sick. Your\ndoctor will need to change your treatment.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), seen commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\nIf you take Glyxambi with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulphonylurea \nor insulin, you are at risk of getting too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).

LABELLING\n\tB. PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what glyxambi is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "glyxambi is an anti-diabetic medicine that contains two active substances called empagliflozin and linagliptin: empagliflozin works by blocking a protein in the kidneys called sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (sglt2). sglt2 prevents glucose from being excreted in urine by absorbing glucose back into the bloodstream as blood is being filtered in the kidneys. by blocking this protein, the medicine causes glucose (blood sugar), sodium (salt) and water to be removed via the urine. this helps to lower blood glucose levels, which are too high because of your type 2 diabetes. linagliptin works in a different way, namely by enabling the pancreas to produce more insulin to lower blood glucose levels. it does this by blocking a protein called dpp-4. glyxambi is added to metformin and/or sulphonylurea (su) to treat type 2 diabetes in adult patients whose diabetes cannot be controlled when treated with metformin and/or sulphonylurea in combination with empagliflozin, or when treated with metformin and/or sulphonylurea in combination with linagliptin. glyxambi can also be used as an alternative to taking both empagliflozin and linagliptin as single tablets. in this case, do not continue taking any one of those tablets separately, if your are taking this medicine. it is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as recommended by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. what is type 2 diabetes? type 2 diabetes is a condition that comes from both your genes and your lifestyle. if you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas may not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood, and your body is unable to use its own insulin effectively. this results in high levels of sugar in your blood, which can lead to medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and poor circulation in your limbs.", "Entity_Recognition":
