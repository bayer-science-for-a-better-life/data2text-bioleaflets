CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nAripiprazole Mylan Pharma is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents \n\naged 15 years and older. \n\n \n\nAripiprazole Mylan Pharma is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in \n\nBipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced \n\npredominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\nAripiprazole Mylan Pharma is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic \n\nepisodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\n \n\nSchizophrenia: the recommended starting dose for aripiprazole is 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day with a \n\nmaintenance dose of 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. \n\nAripiprazole is effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses \n\nhigher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \n\nfrom a higher dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \n\n \n\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: the recommended starting dose for aripiprazole is 15 mg \n\nadministered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination \n\ntherapy (see section 5.1). Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum daily dose \n\nshould not exceed 30 mg. \n\n \n\nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \n\nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \n\ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be \n\nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for aripiprazole is \n\n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \n\ninitiated at 2 mg (using an appropriate aripiprazole containing medicinal product) for 2 days, titrated to \n\n5 mg for 2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, \n\nsubsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the \n\nmaximum daily dose of 30 mg (see section 5.1). Aripiprazole is effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day \n\nto 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated \n\nalthough individual patients may benefit from a higher dose. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nAripiprazole is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \n\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \n\nfor aripiprazole is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. \n\nTreatment should be initiated at 2 mg (using an appropriate aripiprazole containing medicinal product) \n\nfor 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The \n\ntreatment duration should be the minimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed \n\n12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, \n\nand a daily dose of 30 mg is associated with a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse \n\nreactions including EPS related events, somnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses \n\nhigher than 10 mg/day should therefore only be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical \n\nmonitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \n\nTherefore, aripiprazole is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections \n\n4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in children and \n\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \n\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n\n \n\nTics associated with Tourette’s disorder: the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in children and \n\nadolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \n\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThe safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \n\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \n\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nΝο dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \n\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \n\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \n\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nΝο dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \n\n \n\nGender  \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nSmoking status  \n\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nDose adjustments due to interactions \n\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \n\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \n\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \n\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \n\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \n\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nAripiprazole Mylan Pharma is for oral use. \n\n \n\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to Aripiprazole Mylan Pharma \n\ntablets for patients who have difficulty swallowing Aripiprazole Mylan Pharma tablets (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days \n\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \n\n \n\nSuicidality \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \n\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \n\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \n\naccompany antipsychotic treatment.  \n\n \n\nCardiovascular disorders  \n\n \n\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \n\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \n\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \n\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \n\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \n\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \n\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \n\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \n\n \n\nQT prolongation \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \n\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nTardive dyskinesia  \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \n\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \n\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \n\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \n\n \n\nOther extrapyramidal symptoms  \n\n \n\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \n\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \n\nmonitoring should be considered. \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)  \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \n\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \n\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \n\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \n\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \n\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \n\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \n\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \n\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \n\n \n\nSeizure  \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \n\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \n\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n\n \n\nIncreased mortality \n\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56 to 99 years) of aripiprazole \n\nin elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with \n\naripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-\n\ntreated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths \n\nwere varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) \n\nor infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions  \n\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \n\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \n\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \n\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \n\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \n\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \n\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \n\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \n\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \n\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \n\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \n\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \n\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotic, including aripiprazole, should be observed \n\nfor signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) \n\nand patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored \n\nregularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nWeight gain  \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \n\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \n\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \n\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \n\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \n\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \n\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \n\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \n\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nDysphagia \n\n \n\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \n\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \n\n \n\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \n\n \n\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \n\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \n\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \n\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \n\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \n\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \n\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \n\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \n\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \n\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity  \n\n \n\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \n\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \n\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \n\n \n\nFalls \n\n \n\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \n\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk and a lower starting dose \n\nshould be considered (e.g. elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nAripiprazole Mylan Pharma tablets contain maltose. Patients with rare glucose-galactose \n\nmalabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\nAripiprazole Mylan Pharma tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say \n\nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nDue to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \n\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \n\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \n\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \n\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \n\n \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole  \n\n \n\nA gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \n\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \n\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \n\nfor smokers. \n\n \n\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors  \n\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \n\nAUC by 107 %, while Cmax was unchanged. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \n\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \n\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \n\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \n\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \n\n \n\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \n\naripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-\n\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \n\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \n\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \n\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \n\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \n\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \n\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to \n\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \n\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \n\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \n\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \n\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \n\n \n\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers  \n\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \n\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of Cmax \n\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \n\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax \n\nand AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \n\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \n\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \n\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \n\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \n\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \n\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \n\n \n\nValproate and lithium  \n\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \n\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \n\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \n\n \n\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \n\nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \n\nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \n\nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \n\ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \n\n \n\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \n\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \n\n \n\nSerotonin syndrome \n\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \n\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \n\nmedicinal products, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/selective serotonin noradrenalin \n\nreuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI), or with medicinal products that are known to increase aripiprazole \n\nconcentrations (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \n\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \n\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \n\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \n\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \n\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \n\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \n\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \n\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \n\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \n\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nAripiprazole/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \n\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \n\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \n\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \n\nsection 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \n\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \n\ntabulated below. The table is based on adverse events reported during clinical trials and/or post-\n\nmarketing use.  \n\n \n\nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (≥ 1 /10), common (≥ 1/100 \n\nto< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) \n\nand not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \n\nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they \n\nare derived from spontaneous reports.

In a long-term \n\n26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and \n\n13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of \n\nEPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients.  \n\n \n\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \n\nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \n\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \n\nwith lithium. In the long-term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \n\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \n\n \n\nAkathisia  \n\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \n\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \n\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \n\n \n\nDystonia \n\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \n\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \n\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \n\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \n\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \n\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \n\nage groups. \n\n \n\nProlactin \n\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \n\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \n\n \n\nLaboratory parameters \n\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \n\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \n\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \n\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \n\npatients who received placebo. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \n\nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13 to 17 years) with \n\nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \n\nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \n\nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): Somnolence/sedation and \n\nextrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (≥ 1/10), and dry mouth, increased appetite, \n\nand orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (≥ 1/100, < 1/10). The safety profile in a \n\n26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled \n\ntrial. \n\nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was also similar except for the \n\nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \n\ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (≥ 1/100, \n\n< 1/10). \n\n \n\nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13 to 17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \n\nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 29.5 % \n\nand 48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \n\nexposure of 5 mg to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females \n\n(< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \n\nIn two long-term trials with adolescent (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \n\naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) \n\nwas 37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \n\n \n\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \n\nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \n\nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (≥ 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \n\nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (≥ 1/100, \n\n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \n\ntwitching, and dyskinesia. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \n\n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %; 30 mg, 28.8 %; placebo, 1.7 %); and akathisia (incidences were \n\n10 mg, 12.1 %; 30 mg, 20.3 %; placebo, 1.7 %). \n\n \n\nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \n\naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with \n\nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \n\n \n\nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10 to 17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \n\nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \n\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \n\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \n\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \n\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \n\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \n\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \n\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \n\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \n\n \n\nManagement of overdose  \n\n \n\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \n\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \n\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore, cardiovascular monitoring should be started \n\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \n\narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \n\nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n\n \n\nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by \n\nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \n\noverdose. \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\n \n\nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \n\naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \n\nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nIt has been proposed that aripiprazole’s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \n\nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \n\nantagonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \n\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \n\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin \n\n5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \n\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \n\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \n\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \n\naripiprazole. \n\n \n\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for \n\n2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor \n\nligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAdults \n\n \n\nSchizophrenia \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \n\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \n\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \n\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \n\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \n\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \n\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \n\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale \n\n(MADRS) showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \n\n \n\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \n\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \n\nplacebo. \n\n \n\nWeight gain \n\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \n\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \n\n314 adult patients and where the primary endpoint was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \n\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight \n\nof~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \n\n33 % of evaluable patients). \n\n \n\nLipid parameters \n\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \n\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \n\nHigh Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoproten (LDL). \n\n \n\nProlactin \n\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \n\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \n\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \n\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \n\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \n\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \n\n \n\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \n\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \n\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \n\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \n\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \n\n \n\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \n\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \n\n \n\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \n\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \n\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \n\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \n\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \n\n \n\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \n\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \n\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \n\nvalproate monotherapy. \n\n \n\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \n\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \n\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \n\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \n\ndepression. \n\n \n\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \n\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Youn Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] and MADRS with \n\ntotal scores ≤ 12) on aripiprazole (10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for \n\n12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % \n\ndecreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in preventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk \n\n(hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing recurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to \n\ndemonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole \n\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo on the secondary outcome measure in Clinical Global \n\nImpression Bipolar version(CGI-BP) Severity of Illness (SOI; mania) scores. In this trial, patients \n\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \n\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \n\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \n\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \n\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \n\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \n\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \n\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nSchizophrenia in adolescents \n\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13 to 17 years), \n\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \n\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \n\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \n\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \n\n \n\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \n\n(n = 146; ages 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \n\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \n\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95 % confidence interval, 0.242 to \n\n0.879) in the full population. In sub-group analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for \n\nsubjects 13 to 14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the \n\nestimation of the HR for the younger (13 to 14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller \n\nnumber of subjects in that group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for \n\nthis estimation (ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of \n\na treatment effect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup \n\n(aripiprazole, n = 69; placebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be \n\nconcluded in the older patients. \n\n \n\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \n\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \n\n(10 to 17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) \n\nfor Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features and had a \n\nYMRS score ≥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in the primary efficacy analysis, \n\n139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \n\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \n\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \n\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \n\n \n\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \n\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \n\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \n\ntreated with placebo. \n\n \n\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \n\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \n\nflexible-dose (2 mg/day to 15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, or 15 mg/day)] and \n\nin one 52-week open-label trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day \n\nafter one week, and increased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75% of \n\npatients were less than 13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy \n\ncompared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical \n\nrelevance of this finding has not been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes \n\nin prolactin levels. The duration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled \n\ntrials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/mL) and males (<2 ng/mL) in \n\naripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7%) and 258/298 (86.6%), respectively. In the placebo-\n\ncontrolled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \n\n \n\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13 to 26 \n\nweek stabilisation on aripiprazole (2 mg/day to 15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either \n\nmaintained on aripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates \n\nat week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 \n\nweeks (aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain \n\nover the stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase \n\nof 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 \n\nweeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in \n\n17% of patients, with tremor accounting for 6.5%. \n\n \n\nTics associated with Tourette’s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2)  \n\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Tourette’s disorder (aripiprazole: \n\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \n\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \n\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 to 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \n\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \n\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \n\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \n\n7.09 in the placebo group.  \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Tourette’s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \n\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \n\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\n\nKorea. Patients were 6 to 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \n\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \n\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \n\n \n\nIn both of these short-term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \n\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \n\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long-term data are available with regard to the \n\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\naripiprazole in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and \n\nin the treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 to 5 hours after \n\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \n\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %. There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of \n\naripiprazole. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of \n\n4.9 L/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \n\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \n\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \n\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \n\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \n\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of \n\naripiprazole AUC in plasma. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \n\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \n\n \n\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 mL/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \n\n \n\nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered \n\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \n\nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in \n\nthe faeces. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \n\nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \n\nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \n\nschizophrenic patients. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \n\nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \n\nschizophrenic patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nSmoking  \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \n\nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \n\npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \n\nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \n\nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \n\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \n\ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\nand development. \n\n \n\nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \n\nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \n\nrelevance to clinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment \n\naccumulation and/or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg/kg/day to 60 mg/kg/day \n\n(3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased \n\nadrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at \n\n60 mg/kg/day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose). The \n\nhighest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nAn additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of \n\nhydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 mg/kg/day \n\nto 125 mg/kg/day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical \n\ndose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m2). However, the \n\nconcentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose \n\nproposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in \n\nthe 39-week study and are well below (6 %) their limits of in vitro solubility. \n\n \n\nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats and dogs, the toxicity profile of aripiprazole was comparable to \n\nthat observed in adult animals, and there was no evidence of neurotoxicity or adverse reactions on \n\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nBased on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-\n\ngenotoxic. Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies. Developmental \n\ntoxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were \n\nobserved in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses \n\nresulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended \n\nclinical dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.
