NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nYERVOY 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of concentrate contains 5 mg ipilimumab. \nOne 10 ml vial contains 50 mg of ipilimumab. \nOne 40 ml vial contains 200 mg of ipilimumab. \n \nIpilimumab is a fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (IgG1\u03ba) produced in Chinese hamster \novary cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n \nEach ml of concentrate contains 0.1 mmol sodium, which is 2.30 mg sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid that may contain light (few) particulates \nand has a pH of 7.0 and an osmolarity of 260-300 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMelanoma \n \nYERVOY as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) \nmelanoma in adults, and adolescents 12 years of age and older (see section 4.4). \n \nYERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or \nmetastatic) melanoma in adults. \n \nRelative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall \nsurvival (OS) for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is established only in patients with \nlow tumour PD-L1 expression (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nRenal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) \n \nYERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with \nintermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma (see section 5.1). \n \nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) \n \nYERVOY in combination with nivolumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated \nfor the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in adults whose tumours have no \nsensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation. \n \n\n\n\n \n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the treatment of \ncancer. \n \nPosology \n \nYERVOY as monotherapy \n \nMelanoma \nAdults and adolescents 12 years of age and older \nThe recommended induction regimen of YERVOY is 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over \na 90-minute period every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses. Patients should receive the entire induction \nregimen (4 doses) as tolerated, regardless of the appearance of new lesions or growth of existing \nlesions. Assessments of tumour response should be conducted only after completion of induction \ntherapy. \n \nYERVOY in combination with nivolumab \n \nMelanoma \nThe recommended dose is 3 mg/kg ipilimumab in combination with 1 mg/kg nivolumab administered \nintravenously every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses. This is then followed by a second phase in which \nnivolumab monotherapy is administered intravenously at either 240 mg every 2 weeks or at 480 mg \nevery 4 weeks, as presented in Table 1. For the monotherapy phase, the first dose of nivolumab should \nbe administered; \n\uf0a7 3 weeks after the last dose of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab if using 240 mg every \n\n2 weeks; or \n\uf0a7 6 weeks after the last dose of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab if using 480 mg every \n\n4 weeks. \n \nTable 1: Recommended doses and infusion times for intravenous administration of \n\nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab \n\n \nCombination phase, every \n3 weeks for 4 dosing cycles \n\nMonotherapy phase \n\nNivolumab 1 mg/kg over 30 minutes \n240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes or \n480 mg every 4 weeks over 60 minutes \n\nIpilimumab 3 mg/kg over 90 minutes - \n\n \nRenal Cell Carcinoma \nThe recommended dose is 1 mg/kg ipilimumab in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab administered \nintravenously every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses. This is then followed by a second phase in which \nnivolumab monotherapy is administered intravenously at either 240 mg every 2 weeks or at 480 mg \nevery 4 weeks, as presented in Table 2. For the monotherapy phase, the first dose of nivolumab should \nbe administered; \n\uf0a7 3 weeks after the last dose of the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab if using 240 mg every \n\n2 weeks; or \n\uf0a7 6 weeks after the last dose of the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab if using 480 mg every \n\n4 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n \n4 \n\nTable 2: Recommended doses and infusion times for intravenous administration of \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab  \n\n \nCombination phase, every \n3 weeks for 4 dosing cycles \n\nMonotherapy phase \n\nNivolumab 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes \n240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes or \n480 mg every 4 weeks over 60 minutes \n\nIpilimumab 1 mg/kg over 30 minutes - \n\n \nYERVOY in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy \n \nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer \nThe recommended dose is 1 mg/kg ipilimumab administered intravenously over 30 minutes every \n6 weeks in combination with 360 mg nivolumab administered intravenously over 30 minutes every \n3 weeks, and platinum-based chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks. After completion of 2 cycles \nof chemotherapy, treatment is continued with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab every 6 weeks in combination with \n360 mg nivolumab administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment is recommended until \ndisease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  \n \nDuration of treatment \nTreatment with YERVOY in combination with nivolumab, should be continued as long as clinical \nbenefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient. (and up to maximum \nduration of therapy if specified for an indication). \n \nAtypical responses (i.e., an initial transient increase in tumour size or small new lesions within the first \nfew months followed by tumour shrinkage) have been observed. It is recommended to continue \ntreatment with YERVOY in combination with nivolumab for clinically stable patients with initial \nevidence of disease progression until disease progression is confirmed. \n \nLiver function tests (LFTs) and thyroid function tests should be evaluated at baseline and before each \ndose of YERVOY. In addition, any signs or symptoms of immune-related adverse reactions, including \ndiarrhoea and colitis, must be assessed during treatment with YERVOY (see Tables 3A, 3B, and \nsection 4.4). \n \nChildren younger than 12 years of age \nThe safety and efficacy of ipilimumab in children younger than 12 years of age has not been \nestablished. \n \nPermanent discontinuation of treatment or withholding of doses \n \nManagement of immune-related adverse reactions may require withholding of a dose or permanent \ndiscontinuation of YERVOY therapy and institution of systemic high-dose corticosteroid. In some \ncases, addition of other immunosuppressive therapy may be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nDose escalation or reduction is not recommended. Dosing delay or discontinuation may be required \nbased on individual safety and tolerability. \n \nGuidelines for permanent discontinuation or withholding of doses are described in Tables 3A and 3B \nfor YERVOY as monotherapy, and in Table 3C for YERVOY in combination with nivolumab or \nadministration of the second phase of treatment (nivolumab monotherapy) following combination \ntreatment. Detailed guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse reactions are described \nin section 4.4. \n \n\n\n\n \n5 \n\nTable 3A When to permanently discontinue YERVOY as monotherapy \n\nPermanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with the following adverse reactions. \nManagement of these adverse reactions may also require systemic high-dose corticosteroid \ntherapy if demonstrated or suspected to be immune-related (see section 4.4 for detailed \nmanagement guidelines). \n\nSevere or life-threatening adverse reactions  NCI-CTCAE v4 Gradea \n\nGastrointestinal: \n\nSevere symptoms (abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea or \nsignificant change in the number of stools, blood in stool, \ngastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation)  \n\n\uf0a7 Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea or colitis \n\nHepatic: \n\nSevere elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin or symptoms of \nhepatotoxicity  \n\n \n\uf0a7 Grade 3 or 4 elevation in AST, \n\nALT, or total bilirubin \n\nSkin: \n\nLife threatening skin rash (including Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis) or severe widespread \npruritus interfering with activities of daily living or requiring \nmedical intervention \n\n\uf0a7 Grade 4 rash or Grade 3 pruritus \n\nNeurologic: \n\nNew onset or worsening severe motor or sensory neuropathy \n\uf0a7 Grade 3 or 4 motor or sensory \n\nneuropathy \n\nOther organ systemsb: \n\n(e.g. nephritis, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, non-infectious \nmyocarditis) \n\n\uf0a7 \u2265 Grade 3 immune-related \n\nreactionsc \n\uf0a7 \u2265 Grade 2 for immune-related \n\neye disorders NOT responding to \ntopical immunosuppressive \ntherapy \n\na Toxicity grades are in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. \nVersion 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4). \n\nb Any other adverse reactions that are demonstrated or suspected to be immune-related should be graded according to \nCTCAE.

\n\uf0b7 Persistent Grade 2 or 3 adverse reactions despite management. \n \nWhen YERVOY is administered in combination with nivolumab, if either agent is withheld, the other \nagent should also be withheld. If dosing is resumed after a delay, either the combination treatment or \nnivolumab monotherapy could be resumed based on the evaluation of the individual patient. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of YERVOY in children younger than 12 years of age have not been \nestablished. Very limited data are available. YERVOY should not be used in children younger than 12 \nyears of age. \n \nElderly \nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were reported between elderly (\u2265 65 years) and younger \npatients (< 65 years). Data from first-line RCC patients 75 years of age or older are too limited to draw \nconclusions on this population (see section 5.1). No specific dose adjustment is necessary in this \npopulation (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of YERVOY have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Based \non population pharmacokinetic results, no specific dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild \nto moderate renal dysfunction (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of YERVOY have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Based \non the population pharmacokinetic results, no specific dose adjustment is necessary in patients with \nmild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). YERVOY must be administered with caution in patients \nwith transaminase levels \u2265 5 x ULN or bilirubin levels > 3 x ULN at baseline (see section 5.1).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nYERVOY is for intravenous use. The recommended infusion period is 30 or 90 minutes, depending on \nthe dose. \n \n\n\n\n \n9 \n\nYERVOY can be used for intravenous administration without dilution or may be diluted in sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection to \nconcentrations between 1 and 4 mg/ml.  \n \nYERVOY must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. \n \nWhen administered in combination with nivolumab or in combination with nivolumab and \nchemotherapy, nivolumab should be given first followed by YERVOY and then by chemotherapy on \nthe same day. Use separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion. \n \nFor instructions on the preparation and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nWhen ipilimumab is administered in combination, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nthe other combination therapy components prior to initiation of treatment. For additional information \non warnings and precautions associated with nivolumab treatment, please refer to the nivolumab \nSmPC. Most immune-related adverse reactions improved or resolved with appropriate management, \nincluding initiation of corticosteroids and treatment modifications (see section 4.2). Immune-related \nadverse reactions have occurred at higher frequencies when nivolumab was administered in \ncombination with ipilimumab compared with nivolumab as monotherapy. \n \nCardiac and pulmonary adverse events including pulmonary embolism have also been reported with \ncombination therapy. Patients should be monitored for cardiac and pulmonary adverse reactions \ncontinuously, as well as for clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities indicative of \nelectrolyte disturbances and dehydration prior to and periodically during treatment. Ipilimumab in \ncombination with nivolumab should be discontinued for life-threatening or recurrent severe cardiac \nand pulmonary adverse reactions (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients should be monitored continuously (at least up to 5 months after the last dose) as an adverse \nreaction with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab may occur at any time during or after \ndiscontinuation of therapy. \n \nImmune-related reactions \n \nIpilimumab is associated with inflammatory adverse reactions resulting from increased or excessive \nimmune activity (immune-related adverse reactions), likely to be related to its mechanism of action. \nImmune-related adverse reactions, which can be severe or life-threatening, may involve the \ngastrointestinal, liver, skin, nervous, endocrine, or other organ systems. While most immune-related \nadverse reactions occurred during the induction period, onset months after the last dose of ipilimumab \nhas also been reported. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, diarrhoea, increased stool \nfrequency, bloody stool, LFT elevations, rash and endocrinopathy must be considered inflammatory \nand ipilimumab-related. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to minimise \nlife-threatening complications. \n \nSystemic high-dose corticosteroid with or without additional immunosuppressive therapy may be \nrequired for management of severe immune-related adverse reactions.  \n\n\n\n \n10 \n\nIpilimumab specific management guidelines for immune-related adverse reactions are described below \nfor use as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. \n \nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm \naetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, ipilimumab, or \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. If \nimmunosuppression with corticosteroids is used to treat an adverse reaction that occurs as a \nconsequence of combination therapy, a taper of at least 1 month duration should be initiated upon \nimprovement. Rapid tapering may lead to worsening or recurrence of the adverse reaction. \nNon-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy should be added if there is worsening or no \nimprovement despite corticosteroid use. \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab should not be resumed while the patient is receiving \nimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. Prophylactic \nantibiotics should be used to prevent opportunistic infections in patients receiving immunosuppressive \ntherapy. \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be permanently discontinued for any severe \nimmune-related adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-related adverse \nreaction. \n \nImmune-related gastrointestinal reactions \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy \nIpilimumab is associated with serious immune-related gastrointestinal reactions. Fatalities due to \ngastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical trials (see section 4.8). \n \nIn patients who received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in a Phase 3 study of advanced \n(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma (MDX010-20, see section 5.1), the median time to onset of \nsevere or fatal (Grade 3-5) immune-related gastrointestinal reactions was 8 weeks \n(range 5 to 13 weeks) from the start of treatment. With protocol-specified management guidelines, \nresolution (defined as improvement to mild [Grade 1] or less or to the severity at baseline) occurred in \nmost cases (90%), with a median time from onset to resolution of 4 weeks (range 0.6 to 22 weeks). \nPatients must be monitored for gastrointestinal signs and symptoms that may be indicative of \nimmune-related colitis or gastrointestinal perforation. Clinical presentation may include diarrhoea, \nincreased frequency of bowel movements, abdominal pain, or haematochezia, with or without fever. In \nclinical trials, immune-related colitis was associated with evidence of mucosal inflammation, with or \nwithout ulcerations, and lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltration. Post-marketing cases of \ncytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation have been reported in patients with \ncorticosteroid-refractory immune-related colitis. Stool infections work-up should be performed upon \npresentation of diarrhoea or colitis to exclude infectious or other alternate etiologies. \n \nManagement recommendations for diarrhoea or colitis are based on severity of symptoms (per \nNCI-CTCAE v4 severity grading classification). Patients with mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) \ndiarrhoea (an increase of up to 6 stools per day) or suspected mild to moderate colitis (e.g. abdominal \npain or blood in stools) may remain on ipilimumab. Symptomatic treatment (e.g. loperamide, fluid \nreplacement) and close monitoring are advised. If mild to moderate symptoms recur or persist \nfor 5-7 days, the scheduled dose of ipilimumab should be withheld and corticosteroid therapy (e.g. \nprednisone 1 mg/kg orally once daily or equivalent) should be initiated. If resolution to Grades 0-1 or \nreturn to baseline occurs, ipilimumab may be resumed (see section 4.2). \n \nIpilimumab must be permanently discontinued in patients with severe (Grade 3 or 4) diarrhoea or \ncolitis (see section 4.2), and systemic high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy should be initiated \nimmediately. (In clinical trials, methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day has been used). Once diarrhoea and \nother symptoms are controlled, the initiation of corticosteroid taper should be based on clinical \njudgment. In clinical trials, rapid tapering (over periods < 1 month) resulted in recurrence of diarrhoea \n\n\n\n \n11 \n\nor colitis in some patients. Patients must be evaluated for evidence of gastrointestinal perforation or \nperitonitis.  \n \nThe experience from clinical trials on the management of corticosteroid-refractory diarrhoea or colitis \nis limited. Addition of an alternative immunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid regimen should be \nconsidered in corticosteroid-refractory immune-related colitis if other causes are excluded (including \nCytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation evaluated with viral PCR on biopsy, and other viral, \nbacterial and parasitic etiology). In clinical trials, a single dose of infliximab 5 mg/kg was added \nunless contraindicated. Infliximab must not be used if gastrointestinal perforation or sepsis is \nsuspected (see the Summary of Product Characteristics for infliximab). \n \nImmune-related colitis \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nSevere diarrhoea or colitis has been observed with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for diarrhoea and additional symptoms of colitis, such as \nabdominal pain and mucus or blood in stool. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled \nout. \n \nFor Grade 4 diarrhoea or colitis, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be permanently \ndiscontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents.  \n \nGrade 3 diarrhoea or colitis observed with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab requires \npermanent discontinuation of treatment and initiation of corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be withheld. \nPersistent diarrhoea or colitis should be managed with corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab may \nbe resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite \ninitiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents and ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n \nImmune-related pneumonitis \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nSevere pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including fatal cases, has been observed with \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs \nand symptoms of pneumonitis such as radiographic changes (e.g., focal ground glass opacities, patchy \nfiltrates), dyspnoea, and hypoxia. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. \n \nFor Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be permanently \ndiscontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 (symptomatic) pneumonitis, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be \nwithheld and corticosteroids initiated at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon \nimprovement, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. \nIf worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should \nbe increased to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents and ipilimumab in combination with \nnivolumab must be permanently discontinued. \n \n\n\n\n \n12 \n\nImmune-related hepatotoxicity \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy \nIpilimumab is associated with serious immune-related hepatotoxicity. Fatal hepatic failure has been \nreported in clinical trials (see section 4.8). \n \nIn patients who received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in MDX010-20, time to onset of moderate \nto severe or fatal (Grade 2-5) immune-related hepatotoxicity ranged from 3 to 9 weeks from the start \nof treatment. With protocol-specified management guidelines, time to resolution ranged \nfrom 0.7 to 2 weeks. \n \nHepatic transaminase and bilirubin must be evaluated before each dose of ipilimumab, as early \nlaboratory changes may be indicative of emerging immune-related hepatitis (see section 4.2). \nElevations in LFTs may develop in the absence of clinical symptoms. Increases in AST and ALT or \ntotal bilirubin should be evaluated to exclude other causes of hepatic injury, including infections, \ntumour progression, or concomitant medication and monitored until resolution. Liver biopsies from \npatients who had immune-related hepatotoxicity showed evidence of acute inflammation (neutrophils, \nlymphocytes, and macrophages). \n \nFor patients with Grade 2 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, the scheduled dose of ipilimumab \nshould be withheld, and LFTs must be monitored until resolution. Upon improvement, ipilimumab \nmay be resumed (see section 4.2). \n \nFor patients with Grade 3 or 4 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, treatment must be permanently \ndiscontinued (see section 4.2), and systemic high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy (e.g. \nmethylprednisolone 2 mg/kg daily or equivalent) should be initiated immediately. In such patients, \nLFTs must be monitored until normalization. Once symptoms have resolved and LFTs show sustained \nimprovement or return to baseline, the initiation of corticosteroid taper should be based on clinical \njudgment. Tapering should occur over a period of at least 1 month. Elevations in LFTs during taper \nmay be managed with an increase in the dose of corticosteroid and a slower taper. \n \nFor patients with significant LFT elevations that are refractory to corticosteroid therapy, addition of an \nalternative immunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid regimen may be considered. In clinical \ntrials, mycophenolate mofetil was used in patients without response to corticosteroid therapy, or who \nhad an LFT elevation during corticosteroid tapering that was not responsive to an increase in the dose \nof corticosteroids (see the Summary of Product Characteristics for mycophenolate mofetil). \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nSevere hepatitis has been observed with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis such as transaminase and total \nbilirubin elevations. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. \n \nFor Grade 3 or 4 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nmust be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose \nof 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nshould be withheld. Persistent elevations in these laboratory values should be managed with \ncorticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If \nworsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should \nbe increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents and ipilimumab in combination with \nnivolumab must be permanently discontinued. \n \n\n\n\n \n13 \n\nImmune-related skin adverse reactions \n \nCaution should be used when considering the use of ipilimumab or ipilimumab in combination with \nnivolumab in a patient who has previously experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse \nreaction on a prior cancer immune stimulatory therapy). \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy \nIpilimumab is associated with serious skin adverse reactions that may be immune-related. Rare cases \nof toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (including Steven Johnson Syndrome) have been observed, some \nwith fatal outcome. Rare cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) \nhave also been reported in clinical trials and during post-marketing use (see section 4.8). \n \nDRESS presents as a rash with eosinophilia associated with one or more of the following features: \nfever, lymphadenopathy, facial oedema, and internal organ involvement (hepatic, renal, pulmonary). \nDRESS may be characterized by a long latency (two to eight weeks) between medicinal product \nexposure and disease onset. \n \nIpilimumab-induced rash and pruritus were predominantly mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) and \nresponsive to symptomatic therapy. In patients who received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in \nMDX010-20, the median time to onset of moderate to severe or fatal (Grade 2-5) skin adverse \nreactions was 3 weeks (range 0.9-16 weeks) from start of treatment. With protocol-specified \nmanagement guidelines, resolution occurred in most cases (87%), with a median time from onset to \nresolution of 5 weeks (range 0.6 to 29 weeks). \n \nIpilimumab-induced rash and pruritus should be managed based on severity. Patients with a mild to \nmoderate (Grade 1 or 2) rash may remain on ipilimumab therapy with symptomatic treatment (e.g. \nantihistamines). For mild to moderate rash or mild pruritus that persists for 1 to 2 weeks and does not \nimprove with topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroid therapy should be initiated (e.g. \nprednisone 1 mg/kg once daily or equivalent). \n \nFor patients with a severe (Grade 3) rash, the scheduled dose of ipilimumab should be withheld. If \ninitial symptoms improve to mild (Grade 1) or resolve, ipilimumab therapy may be resumed (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nIpilimumab must be permanently discontinued in patients with a very severe (Grade 4) rash or severe \n(Grade 3) pruritus (see section 4.2), and systemic high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy (e.g. \nmethylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) should be initiated immediately. Once rash or pruritus is controlled, \ninitiation of corticosteroid taper should be based on clinical judgment. Tapering should occur over a \nperiod of at least 1 month. \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nSevere rash has been observed with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab (see section 4.8). \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be withheld for Grade 3 rash and discontinued for \nGrade 4 rash. Severe rash should be managed with high-dose corticosteroid at a dose of \n1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nRare cases of SJS and TEN, some of them with fatal outcome, have been observed. If symptoms or \nsigns of SJS or TEN appear, treatment with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be \ndiscontinued and the patient referred to a specialised unit for assessment and treatment. If the patient \nhas developed SJS or TEN with the use of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab, permanent \ndiscontinuation of treatment is recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related neurological reactions  \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy \nIpilimumab is associated with serious immune-related neurological adverse reactions. Fatal \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been reported in clinical trials. Myasthenia gravis-like symptoms have \n\n\n\n \n14 \n\nalso been reported (see section 4.8). Patients may present with muscle weakness. Sensory neuropathy \nmay also occur. \n \nUnexplained motor neuropathy, muscle weakness, or sensory neuropathy lasting > 4 days must be \nevaluated, and non-inflammatory causes such as disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes \nand concomitant medication should be excluded. For patients with moderate (Grade 2) neuropathy \n(motor with or without sensory) likely related to ipilimumab, the scheduled dose should be withheld. \nIf neurologic symptoms resolve to baseline, the patient may resume ipilimumab (see section 4.2). \n \nIpilimumab must be permanently discontinued in patients with severe (Grade 3 or 4) sensory \nneuropathy suspected to be related to ipilimumab (see section 4.2). Patients must be treated according \nto institutional guidelines for management of sensory neuropathy, and intravenous corticosteroids (e.g. \nmethylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) should be initiated immediately. \n \nProgressive signs of motor neuropathy must be considered immune-related and managed accordingly. \nIpilimumab must be permanently discontinued in patients with severe (Grade 3 or 4) motor neuropathy \nregardless of causality (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nSevere nephritis and renal dysfunction have been observed with ipilimumab in combination with \nnivolumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of nephritis or renal \ndysfunction. Most patients present with asymptomatic increases in serum creatinine. Disease-related \naetiologies should be ruled out. \n \nFor Grade 4 serum creatinine elevation, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be \npermanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 or 3 serum creatinine elevation, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be \nwithheld, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents. Upon improvement, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab may be resumed after \ncorticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, \ncorticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents, and \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be permanently discontinued. \n \nImmune-related endocrinopathy \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy \nIpilimumab can cause inflammation of the endocrine system organs, manifesting as hypophysitis, \nhypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism (see section 4.8), and patients may present \nwith nonspecific symptoms, which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying \ndisease. The most common clinical presentation includes headache and fatigue. Symptoms may also \ninclude visual field defects, behavioural changes, electrolyte disturbances, and hypotension. Adrenal \ncrisis as a cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms must be excluded. Clinical experience with \nipilimumab-associated endocrinopathy is limited. \n \nFor patients who received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in MDX010-20, time to onset of \nmoderate to very severe (Grade 2-4) immune-related endocrinopathy ranged from 7 to \nnearly 20 weeks from the start of treatment. Immune-related endocrinopathy observed in clinical trials \nwas generally controlled with immunosuppressive therapy and hormone replacement therapy. \n \nIf there are any signs of adrenal crisis such as severe dehydration, hypotension, or shock, immediate \nadministration of intravenous corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity is recommended, and the \npatient must be evaluated for presence of sepsis or infections. If there are signs of adrenal \ninsufficiency but the patient is not in adrenal crisis, further investigations should be considered \n\n\n\n \n15 \n\nincluding laboratory and imaging assessment. Evaluation of laboratory results to assess endocrine \nfunction may be performed before corticosteroid therapy is initiated. If pituitary imaging or laboratory \ntests of endocrine function are abnormal, a short course of high-dose corticosteroid therapy (e.g. \ndexamethasone 4 mg every 6 hrs or equivalent) is recommended to treat the inflammation of the \naffected gland, and the scheduled dose of ipilimumab should be withheld (see section 4.2). It is \ncurrently unknown if the corticosteroid treatment reverses the gland dysfunction. Appropriate \nhormone replacement should also be initiated. Long-term hormone replacement therapy may be \nnecessary. \n \nOnce symptoms or laboratory abnormalities are controlled and overall patient improvement is evident, \ntreatment with ipilimumab may be resumed and initiation of corticosteroid taper should be based on \nclinical judgment. Tapering should occur over a period of at least 1 month. \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nSevere endocrinopathies, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency (including \nsecondary adrenocortical insufficiency), hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), diabetes mellitus, \nand diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies and for \nhyperglycaemia and changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during \ntreatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation). Patients may present with fatigue, headache, \nmental status changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific \nsymptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an \nalternate aetiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered \nimmune-related. \n \nFor symptomatic hypothyroidism, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be withheld, and \nthyroid hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism, \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be withheld and antithyroid medication should be \ninitiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents \nshould also be considered if acute inflammation of the thyroid is suspected. Upon improvement, \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. \nMonitoring of thyroid function should continue to ensure appropriate hormone replacement is utilised. \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be permanently discontinued for life-threatening \nhyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. \n \nFor symptomatic Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be \nwithheld, and physiologic corticosteroid replacement should be initiated as needed. ipilimumab in \ncombination with nivolumab must be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3) or life-\nthreatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of adrenal function and hormone levels should \ncontinue to ensure appropriate corticosteroid replacement is utilised. \n \nFor symptomatic Grade 2 or 3 hypophysitis, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be \nwithheld, and hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of \n1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents should also be considered if acute inflammation of \nthe pituitary gland is suspected. Upon improvement, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab may \nbe resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be \npermanently discontinued for life-threatening (Grade 4) hypophysitis. Monitoring of pituitary function \nand hormone levels should continue to ensure appropriate hormone replacement is utilised. \n \nFor symptomatic diabetes, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be withheld, and insulin \nreplacement should be initiated as needed. Monitoring of blood sugar should continue to ensure \nappropriate insulin replacement is utilised. Ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab must be \npermanently discontinued for life-threatening diabetes. \n \n\n\n\n \n16 \n\nInfusion reaction \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab \nSevere infusion reactions have been reported in clinical trials of ipilimumab or ipilimumab in \ncombination with nivolumab (see section 4.8). In case of a severe or life-threatening infusion reaction, \nthe ipilimumab or ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab infusion must be discontinued and \nappropriate medical therapy administered. Patients with mild or moderate infusion reaction may \nreceive ipilimumab or ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab with close monitoring and use of \npremedication according to local treatment guidelines for prophylaxis of infusion reactions. \n \nOther immune-related adverse reactions \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy \nThe following adverse reactions suspected to be immune-related have been reported in patients treated \nwith ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in MDX010-20: uveitis, eosinophilia, lipase elevation, and \nglomerulonephritis. In addition, iritis, haemolytic anaemia, amylase elevations, multi-organ failure, \nand pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + gp100 peptide \nvaccine in MDX010-20. Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and serous retinal detachment \nhave been reported post-marketing (see section 4.8). \n \nIf severe (Grade 3 or 4), these reactions may require immediate systemic high-dose corticosteroid \ntherapy and discontinuation of ipilimumab (see section 4.2). For ipilimumab-related uveitis, iritis, \nserous retinal detachment or episcleritis, topical corticosteroid eye drops should be considered as \nmedically indicated. Transient vision loss has been reported in patients with ipilimumab-related ocular \ninflammations. \n \nSolid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with \nipilimumab. Treatment with ipilimumab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant \nrecipients. The benefit of treatment with ipilimumab versus the risk of possible organ rejection should \nbe considered in these patients. \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy or in combination with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor \nHaemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed with ipilimumab as monotherapy \nand ipilimumab in combination with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor (including with nivolumab). Caution \nshould be taken when ipilimumab is administered as monotherapy or in combination with a PD-1 or \nPD-L1 inhibitor. If HLH is confirmed, administration of ipilimumab or ipilimumab in combination \nwith a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor should be discontinued and treatment for HLH initiated.  \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nThe following immune-related adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients treated with \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab in clinical trials across doses and tumour types: \npancreatitis, uveitis, demyelination, autoimmune neuropathy (including facial and abducens nerve \nparesis), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome, aseptic meningitis, \nencephalitis, gastritis, sarcoidosis, duodenitis, myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis. Cases of \nVogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and serous retinal detachment have been reported post-marketing \n(see section 4.8). Transient vision loss has been reported in patients with ipilimumab-related ocular \ninflammations. \n \nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm \naetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, ipilimumab in \ncombination with nivolumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement, \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. Ipilimumab in \ncombination with nivolumab must be permanently discontinued for any severe immune-related \nadverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-related adverse reaction. \n \nCases of myotoxicity (myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis), some with fatal outcome, have \nbeen reported with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab. If a patient develops signs and \n\n\n\n \n17 \n\nsymptoms of myotoxicity, close monitoring should be implemented, and the patient referred to a \nspecialist for assessment and treatment without delay. Based on the severity of myotoxicity, \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be withheld or discontinued (see section 4.2), and \nappropriate treatment instituted.  \nThe diagnosis of myocarditis requires a high index of suspicion. Patients with cardiac or \ncardio-pulmonary symptoms should be assessed for potential myocarditis. If myocarditis is suspected, \nprompt initiation of a high dose of steroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone \n1 to 2 mg/kg/day) and prompt cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup according to current \nclinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis of myocarditis is established, ipilimumab in \ncombination with nivolumab should be withheld or permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). \n \nDisease specific precautions \n \nMelanoma  \nPatients with ocular melanoma, primary CNS melanoma and active brain metastases were not included \nin the MDX010-20 trial (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with ocular melanoma were not included in the CA184-169 clinical trial. However, patients \nwith brain metastases were included in this study, if they were free of neurologic symptoms related to \nmetastatic brain lesions and if they did not require or receive systemic corticosteroid therapy in the \n10 days prior to beginning ipilimumab therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with ocular melanoma, active brain metastases and prior therapy with ipilimumab were not \nincluded in the paediatric trial CA184070 (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with ocular melanoma, active brain metastases and prior therapy with CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, \nor CD137 targeted agents were not included in the paediatric trial CA184178 (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with a baseline performance score \u2265 2, active brain metastases or autoimmune disease, and \npatients who had been receiving systemic immunosuppressants prior to study entry were excluded \nfrom the clinical trials of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab. Patients with ocular/uveal \nmelanoma were excluded from clinical trials of melanoma. In the absence of data, nivolumab should \nbe used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an \nindividual basis. \n \nRelative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in PFS for the combination of ipilimumab with \nnivolumab is established only in patients with low tumour PD-L1 expression. The improvement in OS \nwas similar between ipilimumab with nivolumab and nivolumab monotherapy in patients with high \ntumour PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 \u2265 1%). Before initiating treatment with the combination, physicians \nare advised to carefully evaluate the individual patient and tumour characteristics, taking into \nconsideration the observed benefits and the toxicity of the combination relative to nivolumab \nmonotherapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nUse of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab in melanoma patients with rapidly progressing \ndisease.  \nPhysicians should consider the delayed onset of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab effect \nbefore initiating treatment in patients with rapidly progressing disease (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal Cell Carcinoma \nPatients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, or medical \nconditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the clinical trials of \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). In the absence of data, \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab should be used with caution in these populations after \ncareful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \n\n\n\n \n18 \n\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer \nPatients with active autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, medical conditions \nrequiring systemic immunosuppression, active (untreated) brain metastasis, who received prior \nsystemic treatment for advanced disease, or who had sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK \ntranslocations were excluded from the pivotal trial in first-line treatment of NSCLC (see sections 4.5 \nand 5.1). Limited data are available in elderly patients (\u2265 75 years) (see section 5.1). In these patients, \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy should be used with caution after \ncareful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \nPatients with autoimmune disease  \n \nPatients with a history of autoimmune disease (other than vitiligo and adequately controlled endocrine \ndeficiencies such as hypothyroidism), including those who require systemic immunosuppressive \ntherapy for pre-existing active autoimmune disease or for organ transplantation graft maintenance, \nwere not evaluated in clinical trials. Ipilimumab is a T-cell potentiator that enables the immune \nresponse (see section 5.1) and may interfere with immunosuppressive therapy, resulting in an \nexacerbation of the underlying disease or increased risk of graft rejection. Ipilimumab should be \navoided in patients with severe active autoimmune disease where further immune activation is \npotentially imminently life threatening. In other patients with a history of autoimmune disease, \nipilimumab should be used with caution after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an \nindividual basis.  \n \nPatients on controlled sodium diet \n \nThis medicinal product contains 23 mg sodium per 10 ml vial and 92 mg sodium per 40 ml vial, \nrespectively equivalent to 1.15% and 4.60% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g \nsodium for an adult. To be taken into consideration when treating patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nConcurrent administration with vemurafenib \n \nIn a Phase 1 trial, asymptomatic grade 3 increases in transaminases (ALT/AST > 5 \u00d7 ULN) and \nbilirubin (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN) were reported with concurrent administration of ipilimumab \n(3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID). Based on these preliminary data, the \nconcurrent administration of ipilimumab and vemurafenib is not recommended. \n \nSequential administration with vemurafenib \n \nIn a Phase 2 trial, the sequential treatment with vemurafenib followed by 10 mg/kg ipilimumab in \npatients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma showed a higher incidence of Grade 3+ skin \nadverse reactions than with ipilimumab alone. Caution should be used when ipilimumab is \nadministered following prior vemurafenib. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nLimited, but no long-term, safety data is available on the use of ipilimumab in adolescents 12 years of \nage and older. \n \nOnly very limited data are available in children younger than 12 years of age. Therefore, ipilimumab \nshould not be used in children younger than 12 years of age. \n \nBefore initiating treatment with ipilimumab monotherapy in adolescents of 12 years and older, \nphysicians are advised to carefully evaluate the individual patient, taking into consideration the limited \navailable data, the observed benefits and the toxicity of ipilimumab monotherapy in the paediatric \npopulation (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n\n\n \n19 \n\nIpilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes \n(CYPs) or other drug metabolizing enzymes. \n \nA drug-interaction study in adults of ipilimumab administered alone and in combination with \nchemotherapy (dacarbazine or paclitaxel/carboplatin) was conducted evaluating interaction with CYP \nisozymes (particularly CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4) in patients with treatment-naive \nadvanced melanoma. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was observed \nbetween ipilimumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin, dacarbazine or its metabolite, \n5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). \n \nOther forms of interaction \n \nCorticosteroids \nThe use of systemic corticosteroids at baseline, before starting ipilimumab, should be avoided because \nof their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of ipilimumab. \nHowever, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting ipilimumab \nto treat immune-related adverse reactions. The use of systemic corticosteroids after starting \nipilimumab treatment does not appear to impair the efficacy of ipilimumab. \n \nAnticoagulants \nThe use of anticoagulants is known to increase the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Since \ngastrointestinal haemorrhage is an adverse reaction with ipilimumab (see section 4.8), patients who \nrequire concomitant anticoagulant therapy should be monitored closely. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of ipilimumab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Human IgG1 crosses the placental barrier. The potential \nrisk of treatment to the developing foetus is unknown. YERVOY is not recommended during \npregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, unless the clinical \nbenefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIpilimumab has been shown to be present at very low levels in milk from cynomolgus monkeys treated \nduring pregnancy. It is unknown whether ipilimumab is secreted in human milk. Secretion of IgGs in \nhuman milk is generally limited and IgGs have a low oral bioavailability. Significant systemic \nexposure of the infant is not expected and no effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated. \nHowever, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision must be made \nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from YERVOY therapy taking into account \nthe benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of YERVOY therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nStudies to evaluate the effect of ipilimumab on fertility have not been performed. Thus, the effect of \nipilimumab on male and female fertility is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nYERVOY has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nBecause of potential adverse reactions such as fatigue (see section 4.8), patients should be advised to \nuse caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain that ipilimumab does not \nadversely affect them. \n \n\n\n\n \n20 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIpilimumab as monotherapy (see section 4.2) \n \na. Summary of safety profile \nIpilimumab has been administered to approximately 10,000 patients in a clinical program evaluating \nits use with various doses and tumour types. Unless otherwise specified, the data below reflect \nexposure to ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg in clinical trials of melanoma. In the Phase 3 study MDX010-20, \n(see section 5.1), patients received a median of 4 doses (range 1-4). \n \nIpilimumab is most commonly associated with adverse reactions resulting from increased or excessive \nimmune activity. Most of these, including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate \nmedical therapy or withdrawal of ipilimumab (see section 4.4 for management of immune-related \nadverse reactions). \n \nIn patients who received 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy in MDX010-20, the most frequently \nreported adverse reactions (\u2265 10% of patients) were diarrhoea, rash, pruritus, fatigue, nausea, \nvomiting, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain. The majority were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). \nIpilimumab therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of patients. \n \nb. Tabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported in patients with advanced melanoma who were treated with \nipilimumab 3 mg/kg in clinical trials (n= 767) and from post-marketing surveillance are presented in \nTable 4. \n \nThese reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available \npost-marketing data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of \ndecreasing seriousness. Rates of immune-related adverse reactions in HLA-A2*0201 positive patients \nwho received ipilimumab in MDX010-20 were similar to those observed in the overall clinical \nprogram.  \n \nThe safety profile of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in chemotherapy-naive patients pooled across Phase 2 and \n3 clinical trials (N= 75; treated), in treatment-naive patients in two retrospective observational studies \n(N= 273 and N= 157), and in CA184-169 (N= 362) was similar to that in previously-treated advanced \nmelanoma. \n \nThe safety data for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, treated with ipilimumab \n(3 mg/kg, with a minimum of 3 year follow-up) and enrolled in multi-national, prospective, \nobservational study CA184143 (N= 1151) were similar to what has been reported in ipilimumab \nclinical trials for advanced melanoma. \n \n\n\n\n \n21 \n\nTable 4: Adverse reactions in patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab \n3 mg/kga \n\nInfections and infestations

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC11. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nCytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a key regulator of T-cell activity.\u00a0Ipilimumab is \na CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks T-cell inhibitory signals induced by the CTLA-4 \npathway, increasing the number of reactive T-effector cells which mobilize to mount a direct T-cell \nimmune attack against tumour cells. CTLA-4 blockade can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, \nwhich may contribute to an anti-tumour immune response. Ipilimumab may selectively deplete \nT-regulatory cells at the tumour site, leading to an increase in the intratumoral T-effector/ T-regulatory \ncell ratio which drives tumour cell death. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn patients with melanoma who received ipilimumab, the mean peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte \ncounts (ALC) increased throughout the induction dosing period. In Phase 2 studies, this increase was \ndose-dependent. In MDX010-20 (see section 5.1), ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg with or without \ngp100 increased ALC throughout the induction dosing period, but no meaningful change in ALC was \nobserved in the control group of patients who received an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine alone. \nIn peripheral blood of patients with melanoma, a mean increase in the percent of activated HLA-DR+ \nCD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed after treatment with ipilimumab, consistent with its mechanism \nof action. A mean increase in the percent of central memory (CCR7+ CD45RA-) CD4+ and CD8+ T \ncells and a smaller, but significant, mean increase in the percent of effector memory \n(CCR7- CD45RA-) CD8+ T cells also was observed after treatment with ipilimumab. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nFor additional information on clinical efficacy and safety associated with the dosing recommendations \nof nivolumab when administered as monotherapy following combination therapy with ipilimumab, \nplease refer to the nivolumab SmPC. \n \nBased on modelling of dose/exposure efficacy and safety relationships, there are no clinically \nsignificant differences in efficacy and safety between a nivolumab dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks or \n3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Additionally, based on these relationships, there were no clinically significant \ndifferences between a nivolumab dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks or 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in \nadvanced melanoma and RCC. \n \nClinical trials with ipilimumab monotherapy \n \n\n\n\n \n36 \n\nMelanoma \n \nOverall survival (OS) advantage of ipilimumab at the recommended dose of 3 mg/kg in patients with \npreviously-treated advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma was demonstrated in a \nPhase 3 study (MDX010-20). Patients with ocular melanoma, primary CNS melanoma, active brain \nmetastases, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were not included in \nthe MDX010-20 clinical trial. Clinical trials excluded patients with ECOG performance status > 1 and \nmucosal melanoma. Patients without liver metastasis who had a baseline AST > 2.5 x ULN, patients \nwith liver metastasis who had a baseline AST > 5 x ULN, and patients with a baseline total \nbilirubin \u2265 3 x ULN were also excluded.  \n \nFor patients with a history of autoimmune disease, see also section 4.4. \n \nMDX010-20 \nA Phase 3, double-blind study enrolled patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma \nwho had previously been treated with regimens containing one or more of the following: IL-2, \ndacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, or carboplatin. Patients were randomized in a 3:1:1 ratio to \nreceive ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine (gp100), ipilimumab 3 mg/kg \nmonotherapy, or gp100 alone. All patients were HLA-A2*0201 type; this HLA type supports the \nimmune presentation of gp100. Patients were enrolled regardless of their baseline BRAF mutation \nstatus. Patients received ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 doses as tolerated (induction therapy). \nPatients with apparent tumour burden increase before completion of the induction period were \ncontinued on induction therapy as tolerated if they had adequate performance status. Assessment of \ntumour response to ipilimumab was conducted at approximately Week 12, after completion of \ninduction therapy. \nAdditional treatment with ipilimumab (re-treatment) was offered to those who developed PD after \ninitial clinical response (PR or CR) or after SD (per the modified WHO criteria) > 3 months from the \nfirst tumour assessment. The primary endpoint was OS in the ipilimumab+ gp100 group vs. the \ngp100 group. Key secondary endpoints were OS in the ipilimumab+ gp100 group vs. the ipilimumab \nmonotherapy group and in the ipilimumab monotherapy group vs. the gp100 group.  \n \nA total of 676 patients were randomized: 137 to the ipilimumab monotherapy group, 403 to the \nipilimumab + gp100 group, and 136 to the gp100 alone group. The majority had received all 4 doses \nduring induction. Thirty-two patients received re-treatment: 8 in the ipilimumab monotherapy \ngroup, 23 in the ipilimumab + gp100 group, and 1 in the gp100 group. Duration of follow-up ranged \nup to 55 months. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across groups. The median age \nwas 57 years. The majority (71-73%) of patients had M1c stage disease and 37-40% of patients had an \nelevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline. A total of 77 patients had a history of previously \ntreated brain metastases. \n \nThe ipilimumab-containing regimens demonstrated a statistically significant advantage over the \ngp100 control group in OS. The hazard ratio (HR) for comparison of OS between ipilimumab \nmonotherapy and gp100 was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.87; p = 0.0026).  \n \nBy subgroup analysis, the observed OS benefit was consistent within most of the subgroups of patients \n(M [metastases]-stage, prior interleukin-2, baseline LDH, age, sex, and the type and number of prior \ntherapy). However, for women above 50 years of age, the data supporting an OS benefit of ipilimumab \ntreatment were limited. As the subgroups analysis includes only small numbers of patients, no \ndefinitive conclusions can be drawn from these data. \n \nMedian and estimated rates of OS at 1 year and 2 years are presented in Table 9. \n \n\n\n\n \n37 \n\nTable 9: Overall survival in MDX010-20  \n\n \nIpilimumab 3 mg/kg \n\nn= 137 \ngp100 a \nn= 136 \n\nMedian Months (95% CI) \n10 months  \n(8.0, 13.8) \n\n6 months  \n(5.5, 8.7) \n\nOS at 1 year % (95% CI) 46% (37.0, 54.1) 25% (18.1, 32.9) \n\nOS at 2 years % (95% CI) 24% (16.0, 31.5) 14% (8.0, 20.0) \na gp100 peptide vaccine is an experimental control.  \n \nIn the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy group, median OS was 22 months and 8 months for patients \nwith SD and those with PD, respectively. At the time of this analysis, medians were not reached for \npatients with CR or PR.  \n \nFor patients who required re-treatment, the BORR was 38% (3/8 patients) in the ipilimumab \nmonotherapy group, and 0% in the gp100 group. The disease control rate (DCR) (defined as \nCR+PR+SD) was 75% (6/8 patients) and 0%, respectively. Because of the limited number of patients \nin these analyses, no definitive conclusion regarding the efficacy of ipilimumab re-treatment can be \ndrawn. \n \nThe development or maintenance of clinical activity following ipilimumab treatment was similar with \nor without the use of systemic corticosteroids.  \n \nCA184-169 \nA Phase 3, double-blind study enrolled patients with previously treated or untreated unresectable Stage \nIII or Stage IV melanoma. A total of 727 patients were randomized, 362 to receive ipilimumab \n3 mg/kg and 365 to receive ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses. In the ipilimumab 10 \nmg/kg group, the median OS (95% CI) was 16 months (11.63, 17.84) and in the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg \ngroup the median OS (95% CI) was 12 months (9.86, 13.27). Overall survival compared between \nIpilimumab 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups showed HR = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.99; P-value = 0.04). \nNo statistically significant difference in progression free survival (PFS) was observed between the 10 \nmg/kg and the 3 mg/kg groups. (HR 0.89 with a 95% CI of 0.76, 1.04 and log-rank test P-value = \n0.1548). BORR was similar in the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups. BORR in the 10 mg/kg group was \n15.3% (95% CI: 11.8, 19.5) and in the 3 mg/kg group was 12.2% (95% CI: 9.0, 16.0). Ipilimumab \n10 mg/kg was associated with higher rates of adverse events compared with the 3 mg/kg dose. The \nfrequencies of serious adverse reactions in the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups were 37% and 18%, with \nthe 3 most common serious adverse reactions being diarrhea (10.7% vs 5.5%), colitis (8.0% vs 3.0%), \nand hypophysitis (4.4% vs 1.9%). Adverse events leading to discontinuation in the 10 mg/kg and 3 \nmg/kg groups occurred in 31% and 19% of patients, with AEs leading to death in 4 and 2 patients, \nrespectively. \n \nAt the recommended dose of 3 mg/kg median OS was similar in the subgroup of females \u2265 50 years of \nage compared to the overall population: (11.40 vs 11.53 months). Median OS in the subgroup with \nbrain metastases at baseline was 5.67 months at the recommended dose of 3 mg/kg. \n \nOther studies with ipilimumab monotherapy \n \nMelanoma \n \nCA184332 and CA184338 \nOS of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in chemotherapy-naive patients pooled across Phase 2 \nand 3 clinical trials (N= 78; randomised) and in treatment-naive patients in two retrospective \nobservational studies (N= 273 and N= 157) were generally consistent. In the two observational studies, \n12.1% and 33.1% of the patients had brain metastases at the time of advanced melanoma diagnosis. \nMedian OS and estimated 1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 4-year survival rates are presented in Table 10. \nThe estimated 1-year, 2-year and 3-year survival rates for chemotherapy-naive patients (N= 78) pooled \n\n\n\n \n38 \n\nacross Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials were 54.1% (95% CI: 42.5 - 65.6), 31.6% (95% CI: 20.7 - 42.9) \nand 23.7% (95% CI: 14.3 - 34.4) respectively. \n \n\nTable 10: Overall survival in observational studies  \n\n \nCA184338  \nn= 273 \n\nCA184332 \nn= 157 \n\nMedian OS (95% CI) \n14 months  \n(12.8-18.7) \n\n10 months \n(7.0-12.8) \n\nOS at 1 year % (95% CI) 59% (52.5-64.3) 44% (35.5, 51.4) \nOS at 2 years % (95% CI) 39% (33.1-44.8) 26% (18.9-33.3) \nOS at 3 years % (95% CI) 31% (25.5-36.7) 22% (15.5-29.2) \nOS at 4 years % (95% CI) 26% (20.4-31.3) 22% (15.5-29.2) \n\n \nPatients with brain metastases in study CA184332 had a median OS of 7 months (95% \nCI: 5.06 - 12.81) and patients without brain metastases had a median OS of 14.1 months (95% \nCI: 9.96-Not estimated). \n \nPatients with brain metastases in study CA184338 had a median OS of 6.3 months (95% \nCI: 3.2 - 12.0) and patients without brain metastases had a median OS of 17.7 months (95% \nCI: 13.6 \u2013 12.1). \n \nLong term survival benefit of treatment with ipilimumab (at 3mg/kg) is demonstrated through a pooled \nanalysis of OS data from clinical trials in patients with previously treated and treatment naive \nadvanced melanoma (N = 965). The Kaplan-Meier OS curve revealed a plateau beginning around year \n3 (OS rate = 21% [95% CI: 17-24]) that extended up to 10 years in some patients (see Figure 1). \n \nFigure 1:  Overall Survival with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in pooled analysis \n \n\n \n \n \n\nNo. at Risk \n3.0 \nmg/kg \n\n965 429 127 73 41 29 28 12 8 4 0 \n\nO\nve\n\nra\nll\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl \n(p\n\nro\npo\n\nrt\nio\n\nn)\n \n\n3.0 \nmg/kg \n\nTime (months) \n\n\n\n \n39 \n\n \nClinical trials with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab \n \nMelanoma \n \nRandomised phase 3 study of receive ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab or nivolumab as \nmonotherapy vs. ipilimumab as monotherapy (CA209067) \nThe safety and efficacy of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 1 mg/kg nivolumab \n3 mg/kg vs. ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or \nmetastatic) melanoma were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, double-blind study (CA209067). The \ndifferences between the two nivolumab-containing groups were evaluated descriptively. The study \nincluded adult patients with confirmed unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma. Patients were to \nhave ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. Patients who had not received prior systemic \nanticancer therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma were enrolled. Prior adjuvant or \nneoadjuvant therapy was allowed if it was completed at least 6 weeks prior to randomisation. Patients \nwith active autoimmune disease, ocular/uveal melanoma, or active brain or leptomeningeal metastases \nwere excluded from the study. \n \nA total of 945 patients were randomised to receive ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab \n(n = 314), nivolumab monotherapy (n = 316), or ipilimumab monotherapy (n = 315). Patients in the \ncombination arm received nivolumab 1 mg/kg over 60 minutes and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg over \n90 minutes administered intravenously every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses, followed by nivolumab \n3 mg/kg as monotherapy every 2 weeks. Patients in the nivolumab monotherapy arm received \nnivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patients in the comparator arm received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and \nnivolumab-matched placebo intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by placebo every \n2 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (\u2265 5% vs. < 5% tumour cell membrane \nexpression), BRAF status, and M stage per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging \nsystem. Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no \nlonger tolerated. Tumour assessments were conducted 12 weeks after randomisation then every \n6 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary outcome measures were \nprogression-free survival and OS. ORR and the duration of response were also assessed. \n \nBaseline characteristics were balanced across the three treatment groups. The median age was 61 years \n(range: 18 to 90 years), 65% of patients were men, and 97% were white. ECOG performance status \nscore was 0 (73%) or 1 (27%). The majority of the patients had AJCC Stage IV disease (93%); 58% \nhad M1c disease at study entry. Twenty-two percent of patients had received prior adjuvant therapy. \nThirty-two percent of patients had BRAF mutation-positive melanoma; 26.5% of patients had PD-L1 \n\u2265 5% tumour cell membrane expression. Four percent of patients had a history of brain metastasis, and \n36% of patients had a baseline LDH level greater than ULN at study entry. Among patients with \nquantifiable tumour PD-L1 expression, the distribution of patients was balanced across the three \ntreatment groups. Tumour PD-L1 expression was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 28-\n8 pharmDx assay. \n \nAt primary analysis (minimum follow-up 9 months) the median PFS was 6.9 months in the nivolumab \ngroup as compared with 2.9 months in the ipilimumab group (HR = 0.57, 99.5% CI: 0.43, 0.76; \np < 0.0001). The median PFS was 11.5 months in the ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab \ngroup, as compared with 2.9 months in the ipilimumab group (HR = 0.42, 99.5% CI: 0.31, 0.57; \np < 0.0001). \n \nPFS results from descriptive analysis (with minimum follow up of 60 months) are shown in Figure 2 \n(all randomised population), Figure 3 (at the tumour PD-L1 5% cut off), and Figure 4 (at the tumour \nPD-L1 1% cut off).  \n  \n\n\n\n \n40 \n\nFigure 2: Progression-free survival (CA209067) \n\n \nProgression-free survival per investigator (months) \n\n \nNumber of subjects at risk \nNivolumab + ipilimumab \n\n314 174 136 124 110 101 95 90 82 76 45 2 0 \nNivolumab \n\n316 151 120 106 97 84 78 73 68 65 40 1 0 \nIpilimumab \n\n315 78 46 34 31 28 21 18 17 15 11 1 0 \n \n- - -*- - - -  Nivolumab+ipilimumab (events: 182/314), median and 95% CI: 11.50 (8.74, 19.32). \n\nPFS rate at 12 months and 95% CI: 49% (44, 55), PFS rate at 60 months and 95% CI: 36% (32, 42) \n\u2500\u2500\u2206\u2500\u2500\u2500 Nivolumab (events: 203/316), median and 95% CI: 6.93 (5.13, 10.18). \n\nPFS rate at 12 months and 95% CI: 42% (36, 47), PFS rate at 60 months and 95% CI: 29% (24, 35) \n- - -\uf0a6- - -  Ipilimumab (events: 261/315), median and 95% CI: 2.86 (2.79, 3.15). \n\nPFS rate at 12 months and 95% CI: 18% (14, 23), PFS rate at 60 months and 95% CI: 8% (5, 12) \n \nNivolumab+ipilimumab vs. ipilimumab - hazard ratio and 95% CI: 0.42 (0.35, 0.51);

The observed PFS results at 18 months of follow-up and ORR and \nOS results at 28 months of follow-up were consistently demonstrated across subgroups of patients \nincluding baseline ECOG performance status, BRAF status, M stage, age, history of brain metastases, \nand baseline LDH level. This observation was maintained with the OS results with a minimum follow-\nup of 60 months. \n \nAmong 131 patients who discontinued the combination due to adverse reaction after 28 months of \nfollow-up, the ORR was 71% (93/131) with 20% (26/131) achieving a complete response and median \nOS was not reached. \n \nBoth nivolumab-containing arms demonstrated greater objective response rates than ipilimumab \nregardless of PD-L1 expression levels.

Results from exploratory multivariate analyses \nidentified patient and tumour characteristics (ECOG performance status, M stage, baseline LDH, \nBRAF mutation status, PD-L1 status, and gender) which might contribute to the survival outcome. \n \nEfficacy by BRAF status:  \nAfter 60 months of follow-up, BRAF[V600] mutation-positive and BRAF wild-type patients \nrandomised to ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab had a median PFS of 16.76 months \n(95% CI: 8.28, 32.0) and 11.17 months (95% CI: 7.0, 18.14), while those in the nivolumab \nmonotherapy arm had a median PFS of 5.6 months (95% CI: 2.79, 9.46) and 8.18 months \n(95% CI: 5.13, 19.55), respectively. BRAF[V600] mutation-positive and BRAF wild-type patients \nrandomised to ipilimumab monotherapy had a median PFS of 3.38 months (95% CI: 2.79, 5.19) and \n2.83 months (95% CI: 2.76, 3.06), respectively.  \nAfter 60 months of follow-up, BRAF[V600] mutation-positive and BRAF wild-type patients \nrandomised to ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab had an ORR of 67.0% (95% CI: 57.0, 75.9; \nn = 103) and 54.0% (95% CI: 47.1, 60.9; n = 211), while those in the nivolumab monotherapy arm had \nan ORR of 37.87% (95% CI: 28.2, 48.1; n = 98) and 47.7% (95% CI: 40.9, 54.6; n = 218), \nrespectively. BRAF[V600] mutation-positive and BRAF wild-type patients randomised to ipilimumab \nmonotherapy had an ORR of 23.0% (95% CI: 15.2, 32.5; n = 100) and 17.2% (95% CI: 12.4, 22.9; \nn = 215),  \nAfter 60 months of follow-up, in BRAF [V600] mutation-positive patients median OS was not reached \nin the combination arm and 45.5 months in the nivolumab monotherapy arm. Median OS for BRAF \n[V600] mutation-positive patients in the ipilimumab monotherapy arm was 24.6 months. In BRAF \nwild-type patients median OS was 39.06 months in the combination arm, 34.37 months in the \nnivolumab monotherapy arm, and 18.5 months in the ipilimumab monotherapy arm. The OS HRs for \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab vs. nivolumab monotherapy were 0.70 \n(95% CI: 0.46, 1.05) for BRAF[V600] mutation-positive patients and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.15) for \nBRAF wild-type patients. \n \nRandomised phase 2 study of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (CA209069) \nStudy CA209069 was a randomised, Phase 2, double-blind study comparing the combination of \nnivolumab and ipilimumab with ipilimumab alone in 142 patients with advanced (unresectable or \nmetastatic) melanoma with similar inclusion criteria to study CA209067 and the primary analysis in \npatients with BRAF wild-type melanoma (77% of patients). Investigator assessed ORR was \n61% (95% CI: 48.9, 72.4) in the combination arm (n = 72) versus 11% (95% CI: 3.0, 25.4) for the \nipilimumab arm (n = 37). The estimated 2 and 3 year OS rates were 68% (95% CI: 56, 78) and 61% \n(95% CI: 49, 71), respectively, for the combination (n = 73) and 53% (95% CI: 36, 68) and 44% \n(95% CI: 28, 60), respectively, for ipilimumab (n = 37). \n \nRenal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) \n \nRandomised phase 3 study of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab vs. sunitinib (CA209214) \nThe safety and efficacy of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg for the \ntreatment of advanced/metastatic RCC was evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, open-label study \n(CA209214). The study included patients (18 years or older) with previously untreated, advanced or \nmetastatic renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component. The primary efficacy population included \nthose intermediate/poor risk patients with at least 1 or more of 6 prognostic risk factors as per the \nInternational Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria (less than one year from time of \ninitial renal cell carcinoma diagnosis to randomisation, Karnofsky performance status <80%, \nhaemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium of greater than 10 mg/dL, platelet \ncount greater than the upper limit of normal, and absolute neutrophil count greater than the upper limit \nof normal). This study included patients regardless of their tumour PD-L1 status. Patients with \nKarnofsky performance status < 70% and patients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases, \nactive autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were \nexcluded from the study. Patients were stratified by IMDC prognostic score and region. \n \n\n\n\n \n48 \n\nA total of 1096 patients were randomised in the trial, of which 847 patients had intermediate/poor-risk \nRCC and received either ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 425) administered intravenously over 30 minutes in \ncombination with nivolumab administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses \nfollowed by nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or sunitinib (n = 422) 50 mg daily, \nadministered orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle. Treatment was continued as \nlong as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no longer tolerated. The first tumour \nassessments were conducted 12 weeks after randomisation and continued every 6 weeks thereafter for \nthe first year and then every 12 weeks until progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever \noccurred later. Treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed RECIST, version 1.1-defined \nprogression was permitted if the patient had a clinical benefit and was tolerating study drug as \ndetermined by the investigator. The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS, ORR and PFS as \ndetermined by a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in intermediate/poor risk patients.  \n \nBaseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was \n61 years (range: 21-85) with 38% \uf0b3 65 years of age and 8% \uf0b3 75 years of age. The majority of patients \nwere male (73%) and white (87%), and 31% and 69% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80% and \n90 to 100%, respectively. The median duration of time from initial diagnosis to randomisation was \n0.4 years in both the ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg and sunitinib \ngroups. The median duration of treatment was 7.9 months (range: 1 day- 21.4+ months) in ipilimumab \nwith nivolumab- treated patients and was 7.8 months (range: 1 days- 20.2+ months) in sunitinib-treated \npatients. Ipilimumab with nivolumab was continued beyond progression in 29% of patients. \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for OS (with a minimum follow-up of 24 months) in intermediate/poor risk \npatients are shown in Figure 8. \n \n\n\n\n \n49 \n\nFigure 8: Kaplan-Meier curves of OS in intermediate/poor risk patients (CA209214) \n \n\n \nOverall Survival (Months) \n\nNumber of Subjects at Risk \nNivolumab + Ipilimumab \n425 399 372 348 332 317 306 282 257 201 102 33 4 0\nSunitinib   \n422 387 352 316 288 253 233 216 196 147 87 36 3 0\n\nNivolumab + ipilimumab (events: 166/425), median and 95.0% CI: NA (32.49, NA) \n\n Sunitinib (events: 209/422), median and 95.0% CI: 26.97 (22.08, 34.83) \n \nIn intermediate/poor-risk patients, OS benefit was observed in the ipilimumab in combination with \nnivolumab arm vs. sunitinib regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression.

At the time of this analysis, the hazard ratio was 0.66; (99.8% CI 0.48-0.91) with 166/425 \nevents in the combination arm and 209/422 events in the sunitinib arm. At 18 months, the OS rate was \n74.3 (95% CI 69.8-78.2) for ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and 59.9 (95% CI 54.9-64.5) \nfor sunitinib. At 24 months, the OS rate was 66.5 (95% CI 61.8-70.9) for ipilimumab in combination \nwith nivolumab and 52.9 (95% CI 47.9- 57.7) for sunitinib. \n \nPatients \u2265 75 years of age represented 8% of all intermediate/poor risk patients in CA209214, and the \ncombination of ipilimumab with nivolumab showed numerically less effect on OS (HR 0.97, 95% \nCI: 0.48, 1.95) in this subgroup versus the overall population. Because of the small size of this \nsubgroup, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data. \n \n\n\n\n \n51 \n\nFirst-line treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer \n \nRandomised phase 3 study of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and 2 cycles of platinum-\nbased chemotherapy vs. 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (CA2099LA) \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab 360 mg \nevery 3 weeks and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, \nopen-label study (CA2099LA). The study included patients (18 years or older) with histologically \nconfirmed non-squamous or squamous Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC (per the 7th International \nAssociation for the Study of Lung Cancer classification), ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and no \nprior anticancer therapy (including EGFR and ALK inhibitors). Patients were enrolled regardless of \ntheir tumour PD-L1 status.  \n \nPatients with sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK translocations, active (untreated) brain metastases, \ncarcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic \nimmunosuppression were excluded from the study. Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible \nif neurologically returned to baseline at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, \nor on a stable or decreasing dose of < 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents. Randomisation was \nstratified by histology (squamous vs non-squamous), tumour PD-L1 expression level (\u2265 1% vs < 1%), \nand gender (male vs female).  \n \nA total of 719 patients were randomised to receive either ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab \nand platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 361) or platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 358). Patients in the \nipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and platinum-based chemotherapy arm received ipilimumab \n1 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab \n360 mg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks and platinum-based chemotherapy \nadministered every 3 weeks for 2 cycles. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received platinum-based \nchemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles; non-squamous patients could receive optional \npemetrexed maintenance therapy. \nPlatinum-based chemotherapy consisted of carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2; or \ncisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 for non-squamous NSCLC; or carboplatin (AUC 6) and \npaclitaxel 200 mg/m2 for squamous NSCLC. \n \nTreatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 24 months. Treatment \ncould continue beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be \nderiving clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients who discontinued combination therapy because of \nan adverse event attributed to ipilimumab were permitted to continue nivolumab monotherapy. Tumour \nassessments were performed every 6 weeks after first dose of study treatment for the first 12 months, \nthen every 12 weeks until disease progression or study treatment was discontinued.  \n \nCA2099LA baseline characteristics were generally balanced across all treatment groups. The median \nage was 65 years (range: 26-86) with 51% \u2265 65 years of age and 10% \u2265 75 years of age. The majority \nof patients were white (89%) and male (70%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (31%) or \n1 (68%), 57% of patients with PD-L1 \uf0b3 1% and 37% with PD-L1 < 1%, 31% had squamous and 69% \nhad non-squamous histology, 17% had brain metastases, and 86% were former/current smokers. No \npatients received prior immunotherapy. \n \nCA2099LA primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy endpoints were PFS, ORR, \nand duration of response as assessed by BICR. \n \nThe study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in OS, PFS, and ORR for patients randomised \nto nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy as compared to \nplatinum-based chemotherapy alone at the prespecified interim analysis when 351 events were observed \n(87% of the planned number of events for final analysis). Minimum follow-up for OS was 8.1 months. \n \nEfficacy results are shown in Figure 9 (updated OS analysis with a minimum follow-up of 12.7 months) \nand Table 13 (primary analysis with a minimum follow-up of 8.1 months). \n\n\n\n \n52 \n\nAn updated efficacy analysis was performed when all patients had a minimum follow-up of 12.7 months \n(see Figure 9). At the time of this analysis, the hazard ratio for OS was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.80) and \nthe hazard ratio for PFS was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.82). \n \nFigure 9: Kaplan-Meier plot of OS (CA2099LA) \n\n \nOverall Survival (Months) \n\n \nNumber of Subjects at Risk \nNivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy   \n\n 361 326 292    250        227 153 86 33 10 1 0 \nChemotherapy  \n\n 358 319 260    208        166 116 67 26 11 0 0 \n \n\nNivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy (events: 190/361), median and 95% CI: 15.64 (13.93, 19.98) \nChemotherapy (events: 242/358), median and 95% CI: 10.91 (9.46, 12.55) \n\n \nTable 13: Efficacy results (CA2099LA) \n\n \nipilimumab + nivolumab + \n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 361)\n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 358) \n\nOverall Survival \n\n Events 156 (43.2%) 195 (54.5%) \nHazard ratio  \n(96.71% CI)a \n\n0.69  \n(0.55, 0.87)\n\nStratified log-rank p-valueb 0.0006 \n Median (months) \n (95% CI) \n\n14.1 \n(13.24, 16.16) \n\n10.7 \n(9.46, 12.45) \n\n Rate (95% CI) at 6 months 80.9 (76.4,84.6) 72.3 (67.4,76.7) \n  \nProgression-free Survival \n\n Events 232 (64.3%) 249 (69.6%) \nHazard ratio  \n(97.48% CI)a \n\n0.70  \n(0.57, 0.86) \n\nP\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlt\ny \n\nof\n S\n\nur\nvi\n\nva\nl \n\n\n\n \n53 \n\nTable 13: Efficacy results (CA2099LA) \n\n \nipilimumab + nivolumab + \n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 361) \n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 358) \n\nStratified log-rank p-valuec 0.0001 \n Median (months)d \n\n (95% CI) \n6.83 \n\n(5.55, 7.66) \n4.96 \n\n(4.27, 5.55) \nRate (95% CI) at 6 months 51.7 (46.2, 56.8) 35.9 (30.5, 41.3) \n\n   \nOverall Response Ratee 136 (37.7%) 90 (25.1%) \n\n (95% CI) (32.7, 42.9) (20.7, 30.0) \n\nStratified CMH test p-valuef 0.0003 \n\n Complete response (CR) 7 (1.9%) 3 (0.8%) \n\n Partial response (PR) 129 (35.7%) 87 (24.3%) \n   \nDuration of Response \n Median (months)  \n (95% CI)d \n\n10.02 \n(8.21, 13.01)\n\n5.09 \n(4.34, 7.00) \n\n % with duration \u2265 6 monthsg 74 41 \na Based on a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. \nb p-value is compared with the allocated alpha of 0.0329 for this interim analysis. \nc p-value is compared with the allocated alpha of 0.0252 for this interim analysis. \nd Kaplan-Meier estimate. \ne Proportion with complete or partial response; CI based on the Clopper and Pearson Method. \nf p-value is compared with the allocated alpha of 0.025 for this interim analysis. \ng Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of duration of response. \nCMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel \n \nSubsequent systemic therapy was received by 28.8% and 41.1% of patients in the combination and \nchemotherapy arms, respectively.

A HR of 1.36 (95% CI: 0.74, 2.52) in OS and a HR of 1.12 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.96) in PFS was \nobserved for ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy within \nthis study subgroup. ORR was 27.0% in the ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and \nchemotherapy arm and 15.2% in the chemotherapy arm. Forty-three percent of patients aged \u2265 75 years \ndiscontinued treatment with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy. Efficacy \nand safety data of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy are limited in this \npatient population. \n \nIn a subgroup analysis, a reduced survival benefit for ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and \nchemotherapy compared to chemotherapy was observed in patients who were never smokers. However, \ndue to the small numbers of patients, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data. \n \nPaediatric population \nStudy CA184070 was a multi-center, Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of ipilimumab in \npaediatric patients \uf0b31 year to \uf0a3 21 years of age with measurable/evaluable, untreatable, relapsed or \nrefractory solid malignant tumors without a curative option with standard therapy. The study enrolled \n13 patients < 12 of age and 20 patients \uf0b3 12 years of age. Ipilimumab was administered every 3 weeks \nfor 4 doses and then every 12 weeks thereafter in the absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and \ndisease progression. The primary endpoints were safety and pharmacokinetics (PK). Of patients 12 \nyears of age and older with advanced melanoma, ipilimumab 5 mg/kg was administered to three \npatients and ipilimumab 10 mg/kg was administered to two patients. Stable disease was achieved in \ntwo patients at the ipilimumab 5mg/kg dose, one with a duration of > 22 months. \n \nStudy CA184178 was a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 study, in adolescent patients \n12 to < 18 years of age with previously treated or untreated, unresectable Stage III or Stage IV \nmalignant melanoma. Ipilimumab was administered every 3 weeks for 4 doses. The primary efficacy \nendpoint was 1-year survival rate. Secondary efficacy endpoints of best overall response rate (BORR), \nstable disease (SD), disease control rate (DCR), and progression free survival (PFS) were based on \nmWHO criteria and determined by the investigator\u2019s assessment. Overall survival (OS) was also \nevaluated. Tumor assessment was performed at Week 12. All patients were followed for at least 1 \nyear. Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was administered to four patients and ipilimumab 10 mg/kg was \nadministered to eight patients. Most patients were male (58%) and white (92%). Median age was 15 \nyears. Stable disease was achieved for 260 days in one patient on ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and \napproximately 14 months in one patient on ipilimumab 10 mg/kg. Two patients treated with \nipilimumab 10 mg/kg experienced a partial response, one of which was a durable response for more \nthan 1 year. Additional efficacy results are presented in Table 15. \n\n \n\nTable 15: Efficacy Results in CA184178  \n\n \nIpilimumab 3 mg/kg \n\nN= 4 \nIpilimumab 10 mg/kg \n\nN= 8 \n1-year OS (%) (95% CI) 75% (12.8, 96.1) 62.5% (22.9, 86.1) \nBORR (%) (95% CI) 0% (0, 60.2) 25% (3.2, 65.1) \nSD (n/N)a 1/4 1/8 \nDCR (%) (95% CI) 25% (0.6, 80.6) 37.5% (8.5, 75.5) \nMedian PFS (months) (95% CI) 2.6 (2.3, 8.5) 2.9 (0.7,NEa) \nMedian OS (months) (95% CI) 18.2 (8.9, 18.2) Not reached (5.2, NE) \n\na NE= not estimable \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\n\n\n \n55 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab was studied in 785 patients with advanced melanoma who \nreceived induction doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg administered once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. \nCmax, Cmin and AUC of ipilimumab were found to be dose proportional within the dose range \nexamined. Upon repeated dosing of ipilimumab administered every 3 weeks, CL was found to be \ntime-invariant, and minimal systemic accumulation was observed as evident by an accumulation \nindex 1.5 fold or less. Ipilimumab steady-state was reached by the third dose. Based on population \npharmacokinetic analysis, the following mean (percent coefficient of variation) parameters of \nipilimumab were obtained: terminal half-life of 15.4 days (34.4%); systemic CL of 16.8 ml/h (38.1%); \nand volume of distribution at steady-state of 7.47 l (10.1%). The mean (percent coefficient of \nvariation) ipilimumab Cmin achieved at steady-state with a 3 mg/kg induction regimen was 19.4 \u00b5g/ml \n(74.6%). \n \nIpilimumab CL increased with increasing body weight and with increasing LDH at baseline; however, \nno dose adjustment is required for elevated LDH or body weight after administration on a mg/kg basis. \nCL was not affected by age (range 23-88 years), gender, concomitant use of budesonide or \ndacarbazine, performance status, HLA-A2*0201 status, mild hepatic impairment, renal impairment, \nimmunogenicity, and previous anticancer therapy. The effect of race was not examined as there was \ninsufficient data in non-Caucasian ethnic groups. No controlled studies have been conducted to \nevaluate the pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab in the paediatric population or in patients with hepatic or \nrenal impairment. \n \nBased on an exposure-response analysis in 497 patients with advanced melanoma, OS was \nindependent of prior systemic anti-cancer therapy and increased with higher ipilimumab Cminss \nplasma concentrations. \n \nYervoy in combination with nivolumab: When ipilimumab 1 mg/kg was administered in combination \nwith nivolumab 3 mg/kg, the CL of ipilimumab was decreased by 1.5% and the CL of nivolumab was \nincreased by 1% which were not considered clinically relevant. When ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was \nadministered in combination with nivolumab 1 mg/kg, the CL of ipilimumab was increased by 9% and \nthe CL of nivolumab was increased by 29%, which was not considered clinically relevant. \n \nWhen administered in combination with nivolumab, the CL of ipilimumab increased by 5.7% in the \npresence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies and the CL of nivolumab increased by 20% in the presence of \npresence of anti-nivolumab antibodies. These changes were not considered clinically relevant. \n \nYervoy in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy: When ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks \nwas administered in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and with 2 cycles of \nchemotherapy, the CL of ipilimumab increased approximately 22% and the CL of nivolumab \ndecreased approximately 10%, which was not considered clinically relevant.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical studies in patients with metastatic \nmelanoma, pre-existing mild and moderate renal impairment did not influence the CL of ipilimumab. \nClinical and pharmacokinetic data with pre-existing severe renal impairment are limited; the potential \nneed for dose adjustment cannot be determined. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical studies in patients with metastatic \nmelanoma, pre-existing mild hepatic impairment did not influence the CL of ipilimumab. Clinical and \npharmacokinetic data with pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment are limited; the potential need for \ndose adjustment cannot be determined. No patients with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment were \nidentified in clinical studies. \n \n\n\n\n \n56 \n\nPaediatric Population \n \nBased on a population PK analysis using available pooled data from 565 patients from 4 phase 2 adult \nstudies (N=521) and 2 paediatric studies (N=44), CL of ipilimumab increased with increasing baseline \nbody weight. Age (2-87 years) had no clinically important effect on the CL of ipilimumab. The \nestimated geometric mean CL is 8.72 mL/h in adolescent patients aged \u226512 to <18 years. Exposures in \nadolescents are comparable with those in adults receiving the same mg/kg dose. Based on the \nsimulation in adults and paediatrics, comparable exposure is achieved in adults and paediatrics at the \nrecommended dose of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn intravenous repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, ipilimumab was generally well tolerated. \nImmune-mediated adverse reactions were observed infrequently (~3%) and included colitis (which \nresulted in a single fatality), dermatitis, and infusion reaction (possibly due to acute cytokine release \nresulting from a rapid injection rate). A decrease in the weight of the thyroid and testes was seen in \none study without accompanying histopathologic findings; the clinical relevance of this finding is \nunknown. \n \nThe effects of ipilimumab on prenatal and postnatal development were investigated in a study in \ncynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant monkeys received ipilimumab every 3 weeks from the onset of \norganogenesis in the first trimester through delivery, at exposure (AUC) levels either similar to or \nhigher than those associated with the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab. No treatment-related \nadverse effects on reproduction were detected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Beginning \nin the third trimester, both ipilimumab groups experienced higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, \npremature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and infant mortality relative to control \nanimals; these findings were dose-dependent. Additionally, developmental external or visceral \nabnormalities were identified in the urogenital system of 2 infants exposed in utero to ipilimumab. \nOne female infant had unilateral renal agenesis of the left kidney and ureter, and one male infant had \nan imperforate urethra with associated urinary obstruction and subcutaneous scrotal edema. The \nrelationship of these malformations to treatment is unclear. \n \nStudies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of ipilimumab have not been performed. \nFertility studies have not been performed. \n \n \n6.

If not \nused immediately, the infusion solution (undiluted or diluted) may be stored for up to 24 hours in a \nrefrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after first opening or dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n10 ml of concentrate in a vial (Type I glass) with a stopper (coated butyl rubber) and a flip-off seal \n(aluminium). Pack size of 1. \n40 ml of concentrate in a vial (Type I glass) with a stopper (coated butyl rubber) and a flip-off seal \n(aluminium). Pack size of 1. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling  \n \nPreparation should be performed by trained personnel in accordance with good practices rules, \nespecially with respect to asepsis. \n \nCalculating the dose: \n \nIpilimumab monotherapy or ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab: \nThe prescribed dose for the patient is given in mg/kg. Based on this prescribed dose, calculate the total \ndose to be given. More than one vial of YERVOY concentrate may be needed to give the total dose for \nthe patient. \n \n\uf0a7 Each 10 ml vial of YERVOY concentrate provides 50 mg of ipilimumab; each 40 ml vial \n\nprovides 200 mg of ipilimumab. \n\uf0a7 The total ipilimumab dose in mg = the patient\u2019s weight in kg \u00d7 the prescribed dose in mg/kg. \n\uf0a7 The volume of YERVOY concentrate to prepare the dose (ml) = the total dose in mg, divided \n\nby 5 (the YERVOY concentrate strength is 5 mg/ml). \n \nPreparing the infusion: \nTake care to ensure aseptic handling when you prepare the infusion.  \n \nYERVOY can be used for intravenous administration either: \n\uf0a7 without dilution, after transfer to an infusion container using an appropriate sterile syringe; \n\nor \n\uf0a7 after diluting to up to 5 times the original volume of concentrate (up to 4 parts of diluent \n\nto 1 part of concentrate). The final concentration should range from 1 to 4 mg/ml. To dilute the \nYERVOY concentrate, you can use either: \n\uf0a7 sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection; or \n\uf0a7 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose solution for injection \n\n \n\n\n\n \n58 \n\nSTEP 1 \n\uf0a7 Allow the appropriate number of vials of YERVOY to stand at room temperature for \n\napproximately 5 minutes. \n\uf0a7 Inspect the YERVOY concentrate for particulate matter or discoloration. YERVOY concentrate \n\nis a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid that may contain light (few) \nparticulates. Do not use if unusual amount of particles and signs of discoloration are present. \n\n\uf0a7 Withdraw the required volume of YERVOY concentrate using an appropriate sterile syringe. \n \nSTEP 2 \n\uf0a7 Transfer the concentrate into a sterile, evacuated glass bottle or intravenous bag (PVC or \n\nnon-PVC). \n\uf0a7 If applicable, dilute with the required volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose solution for injection. For ease of preparation, the \nconcentrate can also be transferred directly into a pre-filled bag containing the appropriate \nvolume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose \nsolution for injection. Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. \n\n \nAdministration: \nThe YERVOY infusion must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. \nAdminister the YERVOY infusion intravenously over a period of 30 or 90 minutes, depending on the \ndose. \n \nThe YERVOY infusion should not be infused at the same time in the same intravenous line with other \nagents. Use a separate infusion line for the infusion. \n \nUse an infusion set and an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size \nof 0.2 \u03bcm to 1.2 \u03bcm). \n \nThe YERVOY infusion is compatible with: \n\uf0a7 PVC infusion sets \n\uf0a7 Polyethersulfone (0.2 \u03bcm to 1.2 \u03bcm) and nylon (0.2 \u03bcm) in-line filters \n \nFlush the line with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose \nsolution for injection at the end of the infusion. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be discarded in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

What YERVOY is and what it is used for \n \nYERVOY contains the active substance ipilimumab, a protein which helps your immune system to \nattack and destroy cancer cells by your immune cells. \n \nIpilimumab alone is used to treat advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer) in adults and adolescents \n12 years of age and older. \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab is used to treat  \n\uf0a7 advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer) in adults \n\uf0a7 advanced renal cell carcinoma (advanced kidney cancer) in adults \n \nIpilimumab in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy is used to treat advanced non-small cell \nlung cancer (a type of lung cancer) in adult. \n \nAs YERVOY may be given in combination with  other anti-cancer medicines, it is important that you \nalso read the package leaflet for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these \nmedicines, please ask your doctor. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use YERVOY \n \nYou should not be given YERVOY  \n\uf0a7 if you are allergic to ipilimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nSection 6 \"Contents of the pack and other information\"). Talk to your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using YERVOY as it may cause: \n\n \n- Problems with your heart such as a change in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat or an \n\nabnormal heart rythm. \n \n\n- Inflammation of the intestines (colitis) which can worsen to bleedings or bowel perforation. \nSigns and symptoms of colitis may include diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools), an \n\n\n\n \n72 \n\nincreased number of bowel movements than usual, blood in your stools or darker-coloured \nstools, pain or tenderness in your stomach area. \n\n \n- Problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. These may be signs of \n\ninflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease). \n \n\n- Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) that can lead to liver failure. Signs and symptoms of \nhepatitis may include eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain on the right side of your stomach \narea, tiredness. \n\n \n- Inflammation of the skin that can lead to severe skin reaction (known as toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic \nSymptoms (DRESS)). Signs and symptoms of severe skin reaction may include such as skin \nrash with or without itching, peeling of the skin, dry skin, fever, fatigue, swelling of the face \nor lymph glands, increase of eosinophils (type of white blood cells) and effects on liver, \nkidneys or lungs. Please note that the reaction called DRESS may develop weeks or months \nafter your last dose. \n\n \n- Inflammation of the nerves that can lead to paralysis. Symptoms of nerve problems may \n\ninclude muscle weakness, numbness or tingling in your hands or feet, loss of consciousness or \ndifficulty waking up. \n\n \n- Inflammation or problems with your kidneys. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal \n\nkidney function tests, or decreased volume of urine. \n \n\n- Inflammation of hormone producing glands (especially the pituitary, adrenal and thyroid \nglands) that may affect how these glands work. Signs and symptoms that your glands are not \nworking properly may include headaches, blurry or double vision, tiredness, decreased sexual \ndrive, behavioral changes.  \n\n \n- Diabetes (symptoms include excessive thirst, the passing of a greatly increased amount of \n\nurine, increase in appetite with a loss of weight, feeling tired, drowsy, weak, depressed, \nirritable and generally unwell) or diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from \ndiabetes). \n\n \n- Inflammation of the muscles such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), \n\nmyositis (inflammation of the muscles) and rhabdomyolysis (stiffness in muscles and joints, \nmuscle spasm). Signs and symptoms may include muscle pain, stiffness, weakness, chest pain, \nor severe fatigue. \n\n \n- Inflammation of the eyes. Signs and symptoms may include redness in the eye, pain in the \n\neye, vision problems, blurry vision or temporary loss of sight. \n \n\n- Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A rare disease in which our immune system makes \ntoo many of otherwise normal infection fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. \nSymptoms may include enlarged liver and/or spleen, skin rash, lymph node enlargement, \nbreathing problems, easy bruising, kidney abnormalities, and heart problems. \n\n \n- Organ transplant rejection.  \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or they get worse. Do not \ntry to treat your symptoms with other medicines. Your doctor may give you other medicines in \norder to prevent more severe complications and reduce your symptoms, withhold the next dose of \nYERVOY, or stop your treatment with YERVOY altogether.  \nPlease note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed, and may develop weeks or months \nafter your last dose. Before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have \nblood tests during treatment. \n\n\n\n \n73 \n\n \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before you are given YERVOY  \n\uf0a7 if you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); \n\uf0a7 if you have, or have ever had, chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) \n\nor hepatitis C (HCV); \n\uf0a7 if you have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency \n\nsyndrome (AIDS). \n\uf0a7 if you have previously experienced a severe skin adverse reaction on a prior cancer therapy. \n\uf0a7 if you have any history of inflammation of the lungs \n \nChildren and adolescents \nYERVOY should not be used in children below 12 years of age.  \n \nOther medicines and YERVOY \nBefore you are given YERVOY, tell your doctor \n\uf0a7 if you are taking any medicines that suppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids. \n\nThese medicines may interfere with the effect of YERVOY. However, once you are treated with \nYERVOY, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce the side-effects that you may \nhave with YERVOY.  \n\n \n\uf0a7 if you are taking any medicines that stop your blood from clotting (anticoagulants). These \n\nmedicines may increase the likelihood of bleeding in the stomach or intestine, which is a side-\neffect of YERVOY. \n\n \n\uf0a7 if you have recently been prescribed Zelboraf (vemurafenib, another medicine for the treatment \n\nof skin cancer). When YERVOY is given following prior vemurafenib there may be an \nincreased risk of skin side-effects. \n\n \nAlso tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n \nDo not take any other medicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first. Based on \nearly data, the combination of YERVOY (ipilimumab) and vemurafenib is not recommended due to \nincreased toxicity to the liver. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are \nbreast-feeding.  \n \nYou must not use YERVOY if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. The \neffects of YERVOY in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active substance, \nipilimumab, could harm an unborn baby.  \n\uf0a7 You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with YERVOY if you are a \n\nwoman who could become pregnant.  \n\uf0a7 If you become pregnant while using YERVOY tell your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether ipilimumab gets into breast milk. However, significant exposure of \nipilimumab to the infant through breast milk is not expected and no effects on the breast-fed infant are \nanticipated. Ask your doctor if you can breast-feed during or after treatment with YERVOY. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive, cycle or use machines after you have been given YERVOY unless you are sure you are \nfeeling well. Feeling tired or weak is a very common side effect of YERVOY. This can affect your \nability to drive, cycle or to use machines. \n \nYERVOY contains sodium \nTell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given YERVOY.  \n \n\n\n\n \n74 \n\nThis medicine contains 23 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 10 ml vial. This \nis equivalent to 1.15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nThis medicine contains 92 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 40 ml vial. This \nis equivalent to 4.60% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult  \n \n \n3. How to use YERVOY \n \nHow YERVOY is given  \nYERVOY will be given to you in a hospital or clinic under the supervision of an experienced doctor.  \n \nWhen YERVOY is given alone for the treatment of skin cancer, YERVOY will be given to you as an \ninfusion (a drip) into a vein (intravenously) over a period of 90 minutes. \n \nWhen YERVOY is given in combination with nivolumab for the treatment of skin cancer, you will be \ngiven an infusion over a period of 90 minutes every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses (combination phase). \nThereafter, nivolumab will be given as an infusion over a period of 30 or 60 minutes, every 2 weeks or \n4 weeks, depending on the dose you are receiving (single-agent phase). \n \nWhen YERVOY is given in combination with nivolumab the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, \nyou will be given an infusion over a period of 30 minutes every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses \n(combination phase). Thereafter, nivolumab will be given as an infusion over a period \nof 30 or 60 minutes, every 2 weeks or 4 weeks, depending on the dose you are receiving (single-agent \nphase). \n \nWhen YERVOY is given in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy for the treatment of \nadvanced non-small cell lung cancer, you will be given an infusion over a period of 30 minutes every \n6 weeks. After completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy, ipilimumab will be given in combination with \nnivolumab as an infusion over a period of 30 minutes every 6 weeks. \n \nHow much YERVOY is given  \nWhen YERVOY is given alone for the treatment of skin cancer, the recommended dose is 3 mg of \nipilimumab per kilogram of your body weight.  \n \nThe amount of YERVOY you will be given will be calculated based on your body weight. Depending \non your dose, some or all of the content of the YERVOY vial may be diluted with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose solution for injection before \nuse.

Based on this prescribed dose, calculate the \ntotal dose to be given. More than one vial of YERVOY concentrate may be needed to give the total \ndose for the patient. \n \n\uf0a7 Each 10 ml vial of YERVOY concentrate provides 50 mg of ipilimumab; each 40 ml vial \n\nprovides 200 mg of ipilimumab. \n\uf0a7 The total ipilimumab dose in mg = the patient\u2019s weight in kg \u00d7 the prescribed dose in mg/kg. \n\uf0a7 The volume of YERVOY concentrate to prepare the dose (ml) = the total dose in mg, divided \n\nby 5 (the YERVOY concentrate strength is 5 mg/ml). \n \nPreparing the infusion: \nTake care to ensure aseptic handling when you prepare the infusion.  \n \nYERVOY can be used for intravenous administration either: \n\uf0a7 without dilution, after transfer to an infusion container using an appropriate sterile syringe; \n\nor \n\uf0a7 after diluting to up to 5 times the original volume of concentrate (up to 4 parts of diluent \n\nto 1 part of concentrate). The final concentration should range from 1 to 4 mg/ml. To dilute the \nYERVOY concentrate, you can use either: \n\uf0a7 sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection; or \n\uf0a7 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose solution for injection \n\n\n\n \n83 \n\n \nSTEP 1 \n\uf0a7 Allow the appropriate number of vials of YERVOY to stand at room temperature for \n\napproximately 5 minutes. \n\uf0a7 Inspect the YERVOY concentrate for particulate matter or discoloration. YERVOY concentrate \n\nis a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid that may contain light (few) \nparticulates. Do not use if unusual amount of particles and signs of discoloration are present. \n\n\uf0a7 Withdraw the required volume of YERVOY concentrate using an appropriate sterile syringe. \n \nSTEP 2 \n\uf0a7 Transfer the concentrate into a sterile, evacuated glass bottle or IV bag (PVC or non-PVC). \n\uf0a7 If applicable, dilute with the required volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose solution for injection. For ease of preparation, the \nconcentrate can also be transferred directly into a pre-filled bag containing the appropriate \nvolume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose \nsolution for injection. Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. \n\n \nAdministration: \nThe YERVOY infusion must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. \nAdminister the YERVOY infusion intravenously over a period of 30 or 90 minutes, depending on \nthe dose. \n \nThe YERVOY infusion should not be infused at the same time in the same intravenous line with other \nagents. Use a separate infusion line for the infusion. \n \nUse an infusion set and an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size \nof 0.2 \u03bcm to 1.2 \u03bcm). \n \nThe YERVOY infusion is compatible with: \n\uf0a7 PVC infusion sets \n\uf0a7 Polyethersulfone (0.2 \u03bcm to 1.2 \u03bcm) and nylon (0.2 \u03bcm) in-line filters \n \nFlush the line with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose \nsolution for injection at the end of the infusion. \n \nStorage conditions and shelf life: \nUnopened vial \nYERVOY must be stored in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). The vials must be kept in the original \npackage in order to protect from light. YERVOY should not be frozen. \n \nDo not use YERVOY after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nYERVOY infusion \nFrom a microbiological point of view, once opened, the medicine should be infused or diluted and \ninfused immediately. The chemical and physical in-use stability of the undiluted or diluted infusion \nsolution (between 1 and 4 mg/ml) has been demonstrated for 24 hours at room temperature (20\u00b0C \nto 25\u00b0C) or when refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). If not used immediately, the infusion solution (undiluted \nor diluted) must be used within 24 hours when stored either under refrigeration (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) or at \nroom temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Other in-use storage time and conditions are the responsibility of \nthe user. \n \nDisposal: \nDo not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused medicine or waste \nmaterial should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  \n\n\n\n \n84 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO \nTHE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n\n\n\n \n85 \n\nScientific conclusions \n\nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ipilimumab, the scientific \nconclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  \n\nIn view of available data on solid organ transplant rejection and haemophagocytic \nlymphohistiocytosis from clinical trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases \na close temporal relationship, positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, \nthe PRAC considers a causal relationship between ipilimumab and solid organ transplant rejection \nand also between ipilimumab and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is at least a reasonable \npossibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing ipilimumab \nshould be amended accordingly. \n\nThe updated information is aligned with the SmPCs of other check point inhibitors. \n\n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for ipilimumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ipilimumab is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information. \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

and precautions talk to your doctor before using yervoy as it may cause: - problems with your heart such as a change in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat or an abnormal heart rythm. - inflammation of the intestines (colitis) which can worsen to bleedings or bowel perforation. signs and symptoms of colitis may include diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools), an 72 increased number of bowel movements than usual, blood in your stools or darker-coloured stools, pain or tenderness in your stomach area. - problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. these may be signs of inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease). - inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) that can lead to liver failure. signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain on the right side of your stomach area, tiredness. - inflammation of the skin that can lead to severe skin reaction (known as toxic epidermal necrolysis, stevens-johnson syndrome and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (dress)). signs and symptoms of severe skin reaction may include such as skin rash with or without itching, peeling of the skin, dry skin, fever, fatigue, swelling of the face or lymph glands, increase of eosinophils (type of white blood cells) and effects on liver, kidneys or lungs. please note that the reaction called dress may develop weeks or months after your last dose. - inflammation of the nerves that can lead to paralysis. symptoms of nerve problems may include muscle weakness, numbness or tingling in your hands or feet, loss of consciousness or difficulty waking up. - inflammation or problems with your kidneys. signs and symptoms may include abnormal kidney function tests, or decreased volume of urine. - inflammation of hormone producing glands (especially the pituitary, adrenal and thyroid glands) that may affect how these glands work. signs and symptoms that your glands are not working properly may include headaches, blurry or double vision, tiredness, decreased sexual drive, behavioral changes. - diabetes (symptoms include excessive thirst, the passing of a greatly increased amount of urine, increase in appetite with a loss of weight, feeling tired, drowsy, weak, depressed, irritable and generally unwell) or diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from diabetes). - inflammation of the muscles such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), myositis (inflammation of the muscles) and rhabdomyolysis (stiffness in muscles and joints, muscle spasm). signs and symptoms may include muscle pain, stiffness, weakness, chest pain, or severe fatigue. - inflammation of the eyes. signs and symptoms may include redness in the eye, pain in the eye, vision problems, blurry vision or temporary loss of sight. - haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. a rare disease in which our immune system makes too many of otherwise normal infection fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. symptoms may include enlarged liver and/or spleen, skin rash, lymph node enlargement, breathing problems, easy bruising, kidney abnormalities, and heart problems. - organ transplant rejection. tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or they get worse. do not try to treat your symptoms with other medicines. your doctor may give you other medicines in order to prevent more severe complications and reduce your symptoms, withhold the next dose of yervoy, or stop your treatment with yervoy altogether. please note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed, and may develop weeks or months after your last dose. before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. you will also have blood tests during treatment. check with your doctor or nurse before you are given yervoy if you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); if you have, or have ever had, chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis b (hbv) or hepatitis c (hcv); if you have human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). if you have previously experienced a severe skin adverse reaction on a prior cancer therapy. if you have any history of inflammation of the lungs children and adolescents yervoy should not be used in children below 12 years of age. other medicines and yervoy before you are given yervoy, tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that suppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids. these medicines may interfere with the effect of yervoy. however, once you are treated with yervoy, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce the side-effects that you may have with yervoy. if you are taking any medicines that stop your blood from clotting (anticoagulants). these medicines may increase the likelihood of bleeding in the stomach or intestine, which is a side- effect of yervoy. if you have recently been prescribed zelboraf (vemurafenib, another medicine for the treatment of skin cancer). when yervoy is given following prior vemurafenib there may be an increased risk of skin side-effects. also tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. do not take any other medicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first. based on early data, the combination of yervoy (ipilimumab) and vemurafenib is not recommended due to increased toxicity to the liver. pregnancy and breast-feeding tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. you must not use yervoy if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. the effects of yervoy in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active substance, ipilimumab, could harm an unborn baby. you must use effective contraception while you are being treated with yervoy if you are a woman who could become pregnant. if you become pregnant while using yervoy tell your doctor. it is not known whether ipilimumab gets into breast milk. however, significant exposure of ipilimumab to the infant through breast milk is not expected and no effects on the breast-fed infant are anticipated. ask your doctor if you can breast-feed during or after treatment with yervoy. driving and using machines do not drive, cycle or use machines after you have been given yervoy unless you are sure you are feeling well. feeling tired or weak is a very common side effect of yervoy. this can affect your ability to drive, cycle or to use machines. yervoy contains sodium tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given yervoy. this medicine contains 23 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 10 ml vial. this is equivalent to 1.15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. this medicine contains 92 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in
