NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nChondroCelect 10,000 cells/microlitre implantation suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n2.1 General description \n \nCharacterised viable autologous cartilage cells expanded ex vivo expressing specific marker proteins. \n \n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition \n \nEach vial of product contains 4 million autologous human cartilage cells in 0.4 ml cell suspension, \ncorresponding to a concentration of 10,000 cells/microlitre. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nImplantation suspension \nBefore re-suspension the cells are settled to the bottom of the container forming an off-white layer and \nthe excipient is a clear colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRepair of single symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle of the knee (International \nCartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) in adults. Concomitant asymptomatic cartilage \nlesions (ICRS grade I or II) might be present. Demonstration of efficacy is based on a randomised \ncontrolled trial evaluating the efficacy of Chondrocelect in patients with lesions between 1-5cm². \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nChondroCelect must be administered by an appropriately qualified surgeon and is restricted to hospital \nuse only. ChondroCelect is solely intended for autologous use and should be administered in \nconjunction with debridement (preparation of the defect bed), a physical seal of the lesion (placement \nof a biological membrane, preferentially a collagen membrane) and rehabilitation. \n \nPosology \nThe amount of cells to be administered is dependent on the size (surface in cm²) of the cartilage defect. \nEach product contains an individual treatment dose with sufficient number of cells to treat the pre-\ndefined lesion size, as measured at biopsy procurement. The recommended dose of ChondroCelect is \n0.8 to 1 million cells/cm², corresponding with 80 to 100 microlitre of product/cm² of defect. \n \nElderly population \nThe use of ChondroCelect has not been studied in this age group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy in children and adolescents (aged less than 18) have not been established.  \nChondroCelect is therefore not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years.  \n \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \nFor implantation. \n \nChondroCelect is intended solely for use in autologous cartilage repair and is administered to patients \nin an Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation procedure (ACI).  \n \nImplantation of ChondroCelect is to be performed during arthrotomy under sterile conditions and \nrequires both preparation of the defect bed and a seal (biological membrane) to secure the implant. \nComplete joint haemostasis must be achieved prior to membrane fixation and cell implantation. \nDuring the ACI procedure it is important to ensure that a good, direct contact of the implanted cells \nwith the defect bed is obtained as such contact is of paramount importance for optimal tissue \nregeneration. In clinical studies with ChondroCelect a periosteal flap was used as a biological \nmembrane. Scientific publications have shown that commercially available collagen membranes can \nbe used as an alternative to the periost in ACI procedures. However, ChondroCelect has not been \nevaluated in combination with collagen membranes in clinical studies, although a commercially \navailable collagen membrane has been used in patients treated with ChondroCelect under \ncompassionate use. The safety data obtained in these patients do not indicate a particular safety \nconcern, and confirm a lower incidence of hypertrophy as suggested by scientific literature on the use \nof collagen membranes versus periost. \n \nA technical variant of the ACI procedure is the cell seeding method, whereby the cells are seeded onto \na collagen membrane prior to implantation. In this technique, a good fixation using stitches on the \nedges of the collagen membrane is required, in order to assure a direct contact of the implanted cells \nwith the defect bed. Using fibrin glue only, instead of stitches, to secure the implant is not \nrecommended. \n \nThe implantation should be followed by an appropriate rehabilitation schedule for approximately one \nyear, as recommended by the physician (see section 4.4). \n \nFull technical details on the procedures associated with this implantation technique are provided in the \nChondroCelect user manual. \nFor information on preparation and handling of ChondroCelect, please refer to section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to bovine serum. \nChondroCelect must not be used in case of advanced osteoarthritis of the knee. \nPatients with femoral epiphyseal growth plate that is not fully closed \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nChondroCelect is an autologous product and should under no circumstances be administered to other \npatients. \nPatients with acute or recent history of bone or joint infections should be temporary deferred until \ndocumented recovery. \n \nPrecautions for use \nConcomitant knee problems like early osteoarthritis, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), instability of \nthe knee, cartilage lesions at other locations than the femoral condyle, lesions of knee ligaments or of \nthe meniscus, varus or valgus malalignment (abnormal weight distribution in the knee), and \ninflammatory joint disease are potential complicating factors. In the pivotal study of ChondroCelect, \npatients with these comorbidities of the knee were excluded from treatment. Where possible, \nconcomitant knee problems should be corrected prior to or at the latest at the time of ChondroCelect \nimplantation.  \nIn the pivotal study there was no influence of Body Mass Index (BMI) on outcome but bibliographic \ndata shows that a BMI over 30 may adversely affect the success of the procedure. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nRehabilitation \nUpon implantation, the patient should follow an appropriate rehabilitation schedule and physical \nactivity should be resumed as recommended by the physician. Depending on the location, the size of \nthe lesion and the patient’s profile, appropriate rehabilitation instructions have been developed. Too \nearly and vigorous activity may compromise the grafting and the durability of clinical benefit from \nChondroCelect. Therefore the treated knee should be protected according to the recommendations as \noutlined in the appropriate rehabilitation schedule, to avoid early damage which might lead to graft \nfailure. \nDetails and information on the appropriate rehabilitation schedule is provided in the ChondroCelect \nuser manual. \n \nCases in which ChondroCelect cannot be supplied \nIn some cases it can be possible that the source chondrocytes of the patient are not expandable or that \nthe release criteria are not met, due to poor biopsy quality, patient characteristics, or manufacturing \nfailure. Therefore it can occur that ChondroCelect cannot be delivered. The surgeon will be informed \nas early in the process as possible, and should hence select an alternative treatment for the patient \nconcerned. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFibrin glues are routinely used in ACI procedures to seal the outside margins and to improve the \nwater-tightness of the compartment of the biological membrane used to cover the defect. The use of \nfibrin glue inside the cartilage defect bed is not recommended as this may result in a significantly \npoorer outcome (see section 5.3). \nFibrin sealant products differ significantly in their quantitative and qualitative composition. In vitro \ninteraction studies were performed with a commercially available fibrin glue containing aprotinin (a \nfibrinolysis inhibitor of bovine origin). These studies have demonstrated that this type of fibrin sealant \ncan be safely used with ChondroCelect. No interaction studies with any other type of fibrin glues were \nperformed. However, the concomitant use of another type of fibrin glue with a synthetic fibrinolysis \ninhibitor (tranexamic acid) in the pivotal clinical trial did not reveal any safety signal. \n \nPain relief medicinal products should be used according to the recommendations of the responsible \nsurgeon. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nLimited clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Conventional reproductive and \ndevelopmental toxicity studies are not considered relevant, given the nature and the intended clinical \nuse of the autologous cell therapy product. As ChondroCelect is used to repair a cartilage defect of the \nknee and is implanted with the ACI procedure using open-knee surgery, it is not recommended during \npregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nThere are no data on the use of ChondroCelect during breast-feeding. Given the local nature of \nChondroCelect adverse reactions on the nursing infant are not anticipated. A decision should be made \nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding taking into account the potential benefits of the treatment for the \nwoman and the potential risk to the infant.  \n \nFertility  \n \nThere are no data on possible effects of ChondroCelect treatment on fertility.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDue to the surgical nature of the underlying procedure, implantation with ChondroCelect has a major \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines. During the rehabilitation period that follows \ntreatment with ChondroCelect, patients should refer to their treating physician and follow their advice \nstrictly. \nDriving cars and using machines may be limited during the rehabilitation period. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nIn a randomized, controlled study in the target population, 51 patients were treated with \nChondroCelect. In these patients, a periosteal flap was used to secure the implant. \nAdverse reactions occurred in 78.4% of the patients over a 36-months postoperative follow-up period..  \n \nRelated to ChondroCelect: \n\n• arthralgia  \n• cartilage hypertrophy  \n• joint crepitation  \n• joint effusion \n• treatment failure \n• delamination \n\n \nThe adverse reactions listed are those that occurred most frequently, with treatment failure and \ndelamination being the most serious. \n \nRelated to surgical intervention of the knee \n\n• (postoperative) joint swelling \n• arthralgia \n• pyrexia \n• arthrofibrosis \n• decreased range of motion of the knee  \n\n \nMost of the reported adverse reactions were expected as related to the open-knee surgical procedure.. \nThese were generally mild and disappeared in the weeks following surgery. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions   \n \nThey are  listed by System Organ Class and frequency.

According to current literature the incidence of \ncartilage hypertrophy can be reduced by using a collagen membrane to cover the lesion site instead of \nusing a periosteal flap (Gooding et al., 2006; Niemeyer et al., 2008). When a collagen membrane was \nused to seal the lesion site after application of ChondroCelect, the incidence of cartilage hypertrophy \nwas reported to be 1.8% compared to 25% in the randomized, controlled trial alone.  \n \nSynovitis and subchondral bone injuries have been reported in animal models and are possible risks \nwith the use of ChondroCelect. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for disorders of the musculo-skeletal system,  \nATC code: M09AX02 \n \nConventional pharmacodynamic studies for ChondroCelect have not been performed. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe efficacy of ChondroCelect was studied in a phase III, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial \n(TIG/ACT/01/2000) and the first two years of its 4-year extension phase (TIG/ACT/01/2000EXT). \nChondroCelect was compared to the procedure of microfracture in the repair of symptomatic single \ncartilage lesions of the femoral condyles of the knee. 51 patients were treated with ChondroCelect, 61 \npatients were treated with microfracture. Patients aged between 18 and 50 years, who had a single \nsymptomatic cartilage lesion between 1 and 5 cm2 of the femoral condyles met the inclusion criteria. \nPatients could be treatment-naïve or might have undergone previous arthroscopic or other surgical \nrepair procedure(s). Patients with patellofemoral cartilage lesion, OCD, depth of lesion >0.5 cm, prior \nmeniscal transplant, prior mosaicplasty and prior microfracture within the last 12 month were \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nexcluded. Patients had to agree to actively participate in a strict rehabilitation protocol and follow-up \nprogram.  \n\nThe median time since onset of knee injury was slightly longer in the ChondroCelect group than in the \nmicrofracture group (2.0 years versus 1.6 years). More patients in the ChondroCelect treatment group, \ncompared to patients in the microfracture group, had undergone previous knee surgery (88% versus \n77%). In the ChondroCelect group 77% of patients had a medial and 23% a lateral condyle defect. \n\nHistological examination of the repair biopsy at 12 months showed superior structural repair in the \nChondroCelect arm compared to the microfracture arm. There was continuous improvement up to 36 \nmonths in the clinical outcome measure KOOS (the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) in \nboth treatment arms. The estimated benefit was larger in the ChondroCelect group but the results did \nnot reach statistical significance. At this time point 41 patients were evaluated in the ChondroCelect \narm and 49 were evaluated in the microfracture arm. Patients with less than 3 years since onset of \nsymptoms (n=27 in the ChondroCelect arm and n=32 in the microfracture arm) benefited most from \nChondroCelect. For the group with a longer time since onset of symptoms there were no apparent \ndifferences between the 2 groups. Re-intervention on the treated lesion for graft delamination or \nperiost loosening occurred in 2 of 51 patients within 36 months after ChondroCelect implantation, \ncompared to 7 of 61 patients treated with microfracture having generally insufficient or inadequate \ncartilage repair. \n\nAfter the 5 year follow-up period, 37 patients were evaluated in the ChondroCelect arm and 40 in the \nmicrofracture arm. Overall, the clinically relevant benefit of ChondroCelect implantation observed \nover baseline after 36 months was maintained up to 60 months after treatment. No statistically \nsignificant difference could be observed in clinical benefit between ChondroCelect and microfracture \nat that point in time. In the subgroup of patients with recent symptom onset (< 3 years) the clinical \nbenefit of ChondroCelect over microfracture was significantly larger, confirming the results at 36 \nmonths after treatment. In patients with a longer time since onset of symptoms, both treatments \nperformed equally. Seven patients treated with ChondroCelect needed re-intervention, compared to 10 \npatients in the microfracture group. Treatment failure in the ChondroCelect group was generally \nrelated to delamination of the graft.  \n\nPatients with lesions larger than 5 cm² have been treated under compassionate use only. The safety \ndata obtained in these patients do not indicate a particular safety concern. Further clinical data in \npatients with larger lesions are foreseen to be collected in the future. \n\nSixteen patients below 18 years have been treated with ChondroCelect under compassionate use. No \nspecific safety signal was detected in these patients. If, based on the benefit/risk assessment of the \nresponsible surgeon treatment of patients below 18 years is considered, special attention should be \ngiven to ensure that the growth plate is completely closed. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe product is implanted locally. \nThe nature and intended clinical use of ChondroCelect are such that conventional studies on \npharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination are not applicable.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data based on implantation of expanded cartilage cells in goats and mice did not reveal \nspecial hazard for humans. \nIn studies in goats, mild signs of synovitis were observed in the majority of the animals, including \ncontrols at 10 weeks post surgery. Inflammation resolved with time and parameters returned to \nbaseline levels with only some very mild and local signs of synovitis remaining in a few animals. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nAlthough it is thought that these reactions are mostly surgery-related, a potential influence of the \nexpanded chondrocytes cannot be completely excluded. \nIn a study in sheep, the majority of animals showed penetration of the transplanted cells in \nsubchondral bone; in two of these cases complete penetration of underlying bone marrow was \nobserved. This finding might be related to the inability to perform a progressive loading under non-\nweight bearing conditions post-surgery in these models and therefore cannot be fully extrapolated as \nsuch to the human situation. \nA technical variant of the ACI procedure is the cell seeding method, whereby the cells are seeded onto \na collagen membrane prior to implantation. From a pre-clinical study in the orthotopic goat model it \nappeared that this technique provided comparable results as the Brittberg technique, on condition that \na good fixation is established using stitches on the edges of the collagen membrane. Using fibrin glue \nin the defect bed instead of stitches to secure the implant resulted in an overall poor outcome, \nsuggesting the need for a direct contact of the implanted cells with the defect bed \n \n \n6.

What ChondroCelect is and what it is used for \n \nChondroCelect consists of autologous cultured cartilage cells. The product is made from a small \nsample of cartilage cells (a biopsy) taken from your knee. \n \n• Autologous means that your own cells are used to make ChondroCelect.  \n \n• Cartilage is a tissue that is present in every joint. It protects the ends of our bones and allows our \n\njoints to function smoothly.  \n \nChondroCelect is used to repair single symptomatic cartilage defects in the femoral condyle of the \nknee in adults. A defect can be caused by acute trauma, such as a fall. It can also be caused by \nrepetitive trauma,  as a result of overweight or due to incorrect weight-bearing on the knee as a result \nof a knee deformity.  \n\n• The femoral condyle is the end of the thigh bone, which forms part of your knee. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use ChondroCelect \n \nDo not use ChondroCelect if you: \n-  are allergic to any of the ingredients of ChondroCelect (listed in section 6) or to bovine serum \n-  suffer from advanced osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) in your knee. \n- have a growth plate of the knee that is not fully closed \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, surgeon or physiotherapist before using ChondroCelect. \n \n- If you have an acute or recent history of bone or joint infections, you should be temporary deferred \n\nuntil documented recovery. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n- The use of ChondroCelect is generally not recommended when you are  overweight (i.e. a Body \nMass Index over 30) because it could compromise the result of the treatment. Your surgeon will \ngive you more information. \n\n \n- ChondroCelect is not recommended for the repair of cartilage defects in other locations than the \n\nfemoral condyle. \n \n- ChondroCelect should be implanted in an otherwise healthy knee. This means that other knee \n\nproblems such as lesions of the knee ligament or of the meniscus should be corrected before or \nduring ChondroCelect implantation. \n\n \n- You should resume physical activity according to the rehabilitation plan recommended by the \n\nphysical therapist. Too early and vigorous activity may compromise the implant and the \ndurability of clinical benefit from ChondroCelect. \n\n \nOther cases in which ChondroCelect cannot be supplied \nEven if the surgeon has already taken a small sample of cartilage cells (a biopsy) needed to produce \nthe product, it is possible that you will not be eligible for treatment with ChondroCelect. This is the \ncase if the biopsy is of insufficient quality to make ChondroCelect, or in some instances, it may be the \ncells cannot be grown in the laboratory or that the  cells after expansion do not meet all the quality \nrequirements Your surgeon will be informed and might have to select an alternative treatment for you. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of ChondroCelect is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years.  \n \nOther medicines and ChondroCelect \nPlease tell your doctor or physical therapist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. \nThe safe use of ChondroCelect with other medicines has not been studied. \nAsk your doctor for more information as to which pain medication you can safely use. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThe safe use of ChondroCelect has not been demonstrated during pregnancy or breast-feeding. \nChondroCelect is not recommended for pregnant and breast-feeding women. \nPlease inform your doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThe surgical procedure will have a major influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Driving \ncars and using machines may be limited during the rehabilitation period, and the advice of your doctor, \nsurgeon or physical therapist should be strictly followed during this period. \n \n \n3. How to use ChondroCelect \n \nChondroCelect can only be prescribed and implanted by an orthopaedic surgeon in a hospital. \nTreatment with ChondroCelect: a two-step procedure. \n \nVisit 1: evaluation of the cartilage defect and biopsy \nOn the first visit, the surgeon will evaluate your cartilage defect during an exploratory operation \n(arthroscopy). An arthroscopy is performed through very small incisions in the skin, using a narrow \ntelescope (arthroscope) to look at the inside of the knee. If the surgeon decides that treatment with \nChondroCelect is appropriate for you, he/she will take a small sample of cartilage cells (a biopsy) \nfrom your knee. This cartilage sample will be used to make ChondroCelect. \nIt will take at least four weeks to select and culture the cells to make ChondroCelect. \n \nVisit 2: ChondroCelect implantation \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nDuring open-knee surgery, the cartilage cells are implanted into the cartilage defect. This is called \n‘autologous chondrocyte implantation’ (ACI). The purpose is to repair the defect with healthy and \nfunctional cartilage over time. \nTo keep the cartilage cells in place, a biological membrane is sewn over the defect. \n \nRehabilitation \nAfter surgery, you will have to follow a rehabilitation program for approximately one year, to allow \nyour knee to heal well. Your doctor or physical therapist will give you more details on your \nrehabilitation.  \n \nIt is very important to carefully observe the recommendations of your doctor and/or physical \ntherapist. If you do not follow your rehabilitation schedule, the risk of treatment failure may \nincrease. \n \nYou should be very cautious when bending and putting weight on your treated knee. During the \nrehabilitation period, the level of weight-bearing will increase gradually, depending on your weight \nand the size of the cartilage defect. To protect your knee, you will have to wear a brace.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or physical therapist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost side effects of ChondroCelect implantation are side effects related to open-knee surgery. In \ngeneral, these side effects are quite mild and disappear in the weeks following surgery. \n \nYou can recognize most of the joint- related side effects if you have symptoms like pain, snapping, \ngrinding, locking, swelling, bending limitations and stiffness in the knee. Tell your doctor immediately \nif you notice any of these symptoms. \n \nVery common side effects (affects more than 1 user in 10) include: joint pain (arthralgia), overgrowth \nof cartilage cells (cartilage hypertrophy), crackling or clicking sensation when articulating the knee \n(joint crepitation), and joint swelling. \n \nCommon side effects ( affects in 1 to 10  users in 100) include: restriction of knee  motion \n(arthrofibrosis, decreased joint range of motion, decreased mobility), excessive amount of joint fluid in \nthe joint (joint effusion), joint lock, joint inflammation (arthritis, bursitis, synovitis), cavity filled with \nfluid in the knee (bone cyst, synovial cyst), bone swelling, cartilage disorder (chondropathy), benign \nbony growth (exostosis), blood in a joint (haemarthrosis), joint instability, joint stiffness, loose body in \njoint, weakening of muscle (muscle atrophy, Trendelenburg’s sign), degenerative joint disorder \n(osteoarthritis), tendon disorder, inflammation of the tendon (tendonitis), impaired healing, treatment \nfailure, gait disturbance, implant site hypersensitivity, peripheral edema, fever (pyrexia), postoperative \nwound complication (wound site reaction) ,wound infection (including erysipelas), redness, scar \novergrowth, itching, scar pain, wound loosening, wound secretion loosening of the graft or membrane \n(graft complication, graft delamination), injury (cartilage injury, joint injury), blood clot in the deep \nvein of the leg (deep vein thrombosis), large bruise (haematoma), superficial vein inflammation \n(phlebitis), nausea, pain or nerve disorder (pain in extremity, peripheral neuropathy, complex regional \npain syndrome, autonomic neuropathy), syncope, apnea, arthroscopy. \n \nUncommon side effects (affects in 1 to 10 users in 1,000 include: anxiety, dermal and visual \nhypersensitivity ), migraine, mini stroke (transient ischaemic attack), fat entering the circulatory \nsystem (fat embolism), vein blockage and inflammation (thrombophlebitis), blockage in a lung artery \n(lung embolism), itching scar, pain at the front of the knee (chondromalacia), breakdown of knee \ntissue (gonartrhosis, atrophy), discomfort, chronic inflammation (granulomatous lesion). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nReporting of side effect \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or physical therapist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store ChondroCelect \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the container and vial after EXP. \n \nStore between 15°C – 25°C. \nDo not refrigerate or freeze. \nKeep the product vial(s) within the falcon tube in the plastic screw top container in order to protect \nfrom light and bacterial/fungal contamination. \nDo not irradiate. \n \nSince this product will be used during your knee surgery, the hospital staff is responsible for the \ncorrect storage of the product both before and during its use, as well as for the correct disposal \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat ChondroCelect contains \n- The active substance of ChondroCelect consists of a treatment dose of viable autologous human \n\ncartilage cells in vials containing 4 million cells in 0.4 ml, corresponding to a concentration of \n10,000 cells/microlitre.  \n\n- The other ingredient is sterile, buffered Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM), a liquid \ncontaining amino acids, vitamins, salts and carbohydrates to store the cells in the vial. \n\n \nWhat ChondroCelect looks like and contents of the pack \nChondroCelect is a cell suspension (a fluid) for implantation. The cells are kept alive in a small sterile \nvial. The product is packaged in several layers of packaging material which guarantee sterility and \nstable temperature conditions for 48 hours if stored at room temperature. \nEach  pack contains an individual treatment dose consisting of 1 to 3 vials, depending on the number \nof cells needed to treat the specific lesion size. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder: \nTiGenix N.V. \nRomeinse straat 12/2, 3001 LEUVEN \nBelgium \n+32 16 39 60 60 \n+32 16 39 60 70 \ninfo@tigenix.com  \n \nManufacturer: \nPharmaCell Cell Manufacturing Facility B.V., Urmonderbaan 20B, 6167 RD Geleen, Netherlands \n \nThe leaflet was approved in  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnnex IV \n \n\nGrounds for one additional renewal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nGrounds for one additional renewal \n\nBased upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing \nAuthorisation, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of ChondroCelect remains \npositive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons: \n\nOnly 907 patients have been exposed up to now, including patients treated with ChondroCelect \nwithin the clinical trials conducted to support the MA of ChondroCelect. Post-marketing experience \nwith respect to patient number, i.e. 444 patients and duration of follow-up is still quite limited, and \ndoesn’t warrant granting a renewal with unlimited validity. \n\nThe CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 1-yearly PSURs. \n\nTherefore, based upon the safety profile of ChondroCelect, which requires the submission of 1-\nyearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal \napplication in 5 years’ time. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
