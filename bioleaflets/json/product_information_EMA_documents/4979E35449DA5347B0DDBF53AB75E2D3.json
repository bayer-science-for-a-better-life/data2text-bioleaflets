NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI 75 mg powder for oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne jar contains 75 mg of 13C-urea powder. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nWhite, crystalline powder for oral solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI may be used for in vivo diagnosis of gastroduodenal Helicobacter pylori \ninfection in: \n- adults, \n- adolescents, who are likely to have peptic ulcer disease. \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional and under appropriate \nmedical supervision. \n \nPosology \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI is a breath test for single administration. Patients from the age of 12 must \ntake the contents of 1 jar with 75 mg. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor performance of the test, 200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric acid in 200 ml water for patients \nfrom the age of 12 and older (as a pre-administered test meal), as well as tap water (for dissolving the \n13C-urea powder) are necessary. \n \nThe patient must have fasted for over 6 hours, preferably overnight. The test procedure takes \napproximately 40 minutes. \n \nIn case it is necessary to repeat the test procedure, this should not be done until the following day. \n \nThe suppression of Helicobacter pylori might give false negative results. Therefore the test shall be \nused after at least four weeks without systemic antibacterial therapy and two weeks after last dose of \nacid antisecretory agents. Both might interfere with the Helicobacter pylori status. This is especially \nimportant after Helicobacter eradication therapy. \n \nIt is important to follow the instructions for use adequately (see section 6.6), otherwise the reliability \nof the outcome will become questionable. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe test must not be used in patients with documented or suspected gastric infection or atrophic \ngastritis, which might interfere with the urea breath test (see section 4.2). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nA positive test alone does not constitute indication for eradication therapy. Differential diagnosis with \ninvasive endoscopic methods might be indicated in order to examine the presence of any other \ncomplicating conditions, e.g. ulcer, autoimmune gastritis and malignancies. \n \nThere is insufficient data on the diagnostic liability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI to recommend its \nuse in patients with gastrectomy. \n \nFor children from the age of 3, Helicobacter Test INFAI for children aged 3 to 11 is available. \n \nIn individual cases of A-gastritis (atrophic gastritis) the breath test may have false positive results; \nother tests may be required to confirm the Helicobacter pylori status. \n \nIf the patient vomits during the test procedure, necessitating the repetition of the test, this should be \ndone in fasted condition and not before the following day (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI will be affected by all treatments interfering with Helicobacter pylori status \nor urease activity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nIt is not expected that the test procedure may be harmful during pregnancy or lactation. \nIt is recommended to take notice of the product information of eradication therapy products for their \nuse during pregnancy and lactation. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nNone known. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDue to the fact that only 75 mg of 13C-urea is delivered, an overdose is not expected. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other diagnostic agents, ATC code: VO4CX \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 4 \n\n \nFor the amount of 75 mg 13C-urea, which is administered per unit in the course of the breath test, no \npharmacodynamic activity is described. \n \nAfter oral ingestion the labelled urea reaches the gastric mucosa. In the presence of Helicobacter \npylori the 13C-urea is metabolised by the enzyme urease of Helicobacter pylori. \n \n\n2H2N(13CO)NH2 + 2H2O     Enzyme urease      4NH3 + 213CO2 \n \nThe carbon dioxide diffuses into the blood vessels. From there it is transported as bicarbonate into the \nlung and liberated as 13CO2 with the exhaled air. \n \nIn the presence of bacterial urease the ratio of the 13C/12C-carbon isotopes is significantly changed. \nThe portion of 13CO2 in the breath samples is determined by isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometry (IRMS) \nand stated as an absolute difference (-value) between the 00-minute- and the 30-minute-values. \n \nUrease is produced in the stomach only by Helicobacter pylori. Other urease producing bacteria were \nseldom found in the gastric flora. \n \nThe cut off point for discriminating Helicobacter pylori-negative and positive patients is determined to \nbe -value of 4 ‰, which means that an increase of the -value by more than 4 ‰ indicates an \ninfection. In comparison to bioptic diagnostics of an infection with Helicobacter pylori, the breath test \nachieved in clinical trials on 457 patients, a sensitivity in the range of 96.5 % to 97.9 % [95 %-CI: \n94.05 %-99.72 %], and a specificity range from 96.7 % to 100 %. [95 %-CI: 94.17 %-103.63 %], \nwhereas in clinical trials on 93 adolescents from the age 12–17, a sensitivity of 97.7 % [90 %-CI: \n91.3 %], and a specificity of 96.0 % [90 %-CI: 89.7 %] were achieved. \n \nIn the absence of bacterial urease, the whole amount of the administered urea after absorption from the \ngastrointestinal tract will be metabolised like the endogenous urea. Ammonia which is produced as \ndescribed above by the bacterial hydrolysis is included into the metabolism as NH4+. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe orally applied 13C-urea is metabolised to carbon dioxide and ammonia or is integrated into the \nbody’s own urea cycle. Any increase in 13CO2 will be measured by isotopic analysis. \n \nAbsorption and distribution of 13CO2 is faster than the urease reaction. Therefore, the rate-limiting step \nin the whole process is the cleavage of 13C-urea by Helicobacter's urease. \n \nOnly in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients does the administration of 75 mg labelled urea lead to a \nsignificant increase of 13CO2 in the breath sample within the first 30 minutes. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo concerns in relation to the clinical use of the product. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nNone. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n6.3 Shelf-life \n \n3 years \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25 °C. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nA test set contains the following parts: \n \n\nNo. Component Quantity \n\n1 \nJar (10 ml volume, polystyrene with polyethylene snap cap) \ncontaining 75 mg 13C-urea powder for oral solution 1 \n\n2 \n\nLabelled sample glass- or plastic- containers for sampling, storing \nand transporting the breath samples for analysis: \nSampling time: 00-minute-value \nSampling time: 30-minute-value \n\n \n \n2 \n2 \n\n3 Bendable straw for collection of the breath samples into the corresponding sample containers 1 \n\n4 Data sheet for patient documentation 1 \n5 Package leaflet 1 \n6 Page of barcode labels and sticker 1 \n\n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n1. The test is to be performed in the presence of a qualified person. \n2. Each patient should be documented according to the provided data sheet. It is recommended to \n\nperform the test with the patient being in a resting position. \n3. The test starts with the collection of samples for the determination of baseline-value (00-minute-\n\nvalue): \n Take the straw and the two sample tubes with the label \n\n“Sampling time: 00-minute-value” out of the test set. \n Remove the stopper from one of the sample tubes, unwrap the straw and place the straw \n\ninto the container. \n Now the patient breathes gently through the straw until the inner surface of the sample \n\ntube steams up. \n By continuously breathing the patient must pull out the straw and immediately close the \n\nsample tube with its stopper. \n(If the sample tube remains open for more than 30 seconds, the test result might be \nfalsified.) \n\n Hold the sample tube upright and stick the bar-code label marked “00-minute-value” \nround the sample tube, so that the lines of the bar-code are horizontal. \n\n4. Fill up the second sample tube (Label “Sampling time: 00-minute-value”) with breath by \nfollowing the same procedure. \n\n5. Now 200 ml of 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric acid in 200 ml water must be drunk by the \npatient without delay. \n\n6. Now the preparation of the test solution follows: \n The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is taken from the test set, opened, and filled up to \n\nthree quarters of its volume with tap water. \n Close the jar and shake it carefully until all the powder is dissolved. Pour the contents \n\ninto a drinking glass. \n Fill the 13C-urea jar to the brim with water for a second and third time and add these \n\ncontents to the drinking glass (total volume of tap water should be approximately 30 ml). \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n7. This test solution must now be drunk immediately by the patient, and the time of application \nmust be noted. \n\n8. Thirty minutes after administration of the test solution (point 7), collect the 30-minute-value \nsamples in the two containers which are left in the test package (Label “Sampling time: \n30-minute-value”), as described under steps 3 to 4. Use the bar-code labels marked “30-minute-\nvalue” for these samples. \n\n9. Put the relevant bar-code label on the data sheet for patient documentation. Finally seal the \npackage with the sticker. \n\n10. The sample tubes have to be sent in the original packaging, for analysis, to a qualified \nlaboratory. \n\n \nAnalysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories \n \nThe breath samples, collected in 10 ml glass- or plastic sample tubes, are analysed by isotope ratio \nmass spectrometry (IRMS). \n \nThe analysis of the 13C/12C-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test \nHelicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath \nanalysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas \nprecision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. \n \nIt has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. The method validated in \nthe application is as follows: \n \n Sample preparation for (IRMS) \n \nTo determine the 13C/12C-ratio of carbon dioxide in breath by mass spectrometric analysis the carbon \ndioxide must be separated from the breath and introduced into the mass spectrometer. The automatic \npreparation system for isotope mass spectrometers which is dedicated for breath test analysis is based \non a gas-chromatographic continuous flow separation technique. \n \nWater is removed from the sample by means of a Nafion water trap or the gas-chromatographic \npreparation system that separates the individual gases in a gas chromatographic column with Helium \nas eluent. Passing the column the separated gas species of breath are detected by an ionisation \ndetector. The fraction of carbon dioxide gas, identified by its characteristic retention time, is \nintroduced into mass spectrometer. \n \n Mass spectrometric analysis \n \nTo analyse the separated carbon dioxide sample gas its molecules must be ionised, formed into a \nbeam, accelerated by an electric field, deflected in a magnetic field, and finally detected. These five \nprocesses take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer, which consists of three separate sections: \nthe source, flight tube, and collector. Ionisation, beam formation and acceleration all occur in the \nsource, magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector. \n \n Sample inlet \n \nFor introduction of the carbon dioxide into the analyser many sample inlet systems are available. For \nbreath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference \nstandard gas is essential.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI 75 mg powder for oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne jar contains 75 mg of 13C-urea powder. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nWhite, crystalline powder for oral solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI may be used for in vivo diagnosis of gastroduodenal Helicobacter pylori \ninfection in: \n- adults, \n- adolescents, who are likely to have peptic ulcer disease. \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional and under appropriate \nmedical supervision. \n \nPosology \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI is a breath test for single administration. Patients from the age of 12 must \ntake the contents of 1 jar with 75 mg. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor performance of the test, 200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric acid in 200 ml water for patients \nfrom the age of 12 and older (as a pre-administered test meal), as well as tap water (for dissolving the \n13C-urea powder) are necessary. \n \nThe patient must have fasted for over 6 hours, preferably overnight. The test procedure takes \napproximately 40 minutes. \n \nIn case it is necessary to repeat the test procedure, this should not be done until the following day. \n \nThe suppression of Helicobacter pylori might give false negative results. Therefore the test shall be \nused after at least four weeks without systemic antibacterial therapy and two weeks after last dose of \nacid antisecretory agents. Both might interfere with the Helicobacter pylori status. This is especially \nimportant after Helicobacter eradication therapy. \n \nIt is important to follow the instructions for use adequately (see section 6.6), otherwise the reliability \nof the outcome will become questionable. \n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe test must not be used in patients with documented or suspected gastric infection or atrophic \ngastritis, which might interfere with the urea breath test (see section 4.2). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nA positive test alone does not constitute indication for eradication therapy. Differential diagnosis with \ninvasive endoscopic methods might be indicated in order to examine the presence of any other \ncomplicating conditions, e.g. ulcer, autoimmune gastritis and malignancies. \n \nThere is insufficient data on the diagnostic liability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI to recommend its \nuse in patients with gastrectomy. \n \nFor children from the age of 3, Helicobacter Test INFAI for children aged 3 to 11 is available. \n \nIn individual cases of A-gastritis (atrophic gastritis) the breath test may have false positive results; \nother tests may be required to confirm the Helicobacter pylori status. \n \n\nIf the patient vomits during the test procedure, necessitating the repetition of the test, this should be \ndone in fasted condition and not before the following day (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI will be affected by all treatments interfering with Helicobacter pylori status \nor urease activity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nIt is not expected that the test procedure may be harmful during pregnancy or lactation. \nIt is recommended to take notice of the product information of eradication therapy products for their \nuse during pregnancy and lactation. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nNone known. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDue to the fact that only 75 mg of 13C-urea is delivered, an overdose is not expected. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other diagnostic agents, ATC code: VO4CX \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 10 \n\n \nFor the amount of 75 mg 13C-urea, which is administered per unit in the course of the breath test, no \npharmacodynamic activity is described. \n \nAfter oral ingestion the labelled urea reaches the gastric mucosa. In the presence of Helicobacter \npylori the 13C-urea is metabolised by the enzyme urease of Helicobacter pylori. \n \n\n2H2N(13CO)NH2 + 2H2O     Enzyme urease      4NH3 + 213CO2 \n \nThe carbon dioxide diffuses into the blood vessels. From there it is transported as bicarbonate into the \nlung and liberated as 13CO2 with the exhaled air. \n \nIn the presence of bacterial urease the ratio of the 13C/12C-carbon isotopes is significantly changed. \nThe portion of 13CO2 in the breath samples is determined by non-dispersive infrared spectrometry and \nstated as an absolute difference (-value) between the 00-minute- and the 30-minute-values. \n \nUrease is produced in the stomach only by Helicobacter pylori. Other urease producing bacteria were \nseldom found in the gastric flora. \n \nThe cut off point for discriminating Helicobacter pylori-negative and positive patients is determined to \nbe -value of 4 ‰, which means that an increase of the -value by more than 4 ‰ indicates an \ninfection. In comparison to bioptic diagnostics of an infection with Helicobacter pylori, the breath test \nachieved in clinical trials on 457 patients, a sensitivity in the range of 96.5 % to 97.9 % [95 %-CI: \n94.05 %-99.72 %], and a specificity range from 96.7 % to 100 %. [95 %-CI: 94.17 %-103.63 %]. \n \nIn the absence of bacterial urease, the whole amount of the administered urea after absorption from the \ngastrointestinal tract will be metabolised like the endogenous urea. Ammonia which is produced as \ndescribed above by the bacterial hydrolysis is included into the metabolism as NH4+. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe orally applied 13C-urea is metabolised to carbon dioxide and ammonia or is integrated into the \nbody’s own urea cycle. Any increase in 13CO2 will be measured by isotopic analysis. \n \nAbsorption and distribution of 13CO2 is faster than the urease reaction. Therefore, the rate-limiting step \nin the whole process is the cleavage of 13C-urea by Helicobacter's urease. \n \nOnly in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients does the administration of 75 mg labelled urea lead to a \nsignificant increase of 13CO2 in the breath sample within the first 30 minutes. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo concerns in relation to the clinical use of the product. \n \n \n6.

The test is to be performed in the presence of a qualified person. \n2. Each patient should be documented according to the provided data sheet. It is recommended to \n\nperform the test with the patient being in a resting position. \n3. The test starts with the collection of samples for the determination of baseline-value (00-minute-\n\nvalue): \n Take the straw and the breath bag with the label \n\n“Sampling time: 00-minute-value” out of the test set. \n Remove the stopper from the breath bag, unwrap the straw and place the straw into the \n\nbreath bag. \n Now the patient breathes gently through the straw. \n By continuously breathing the patient must pull out the straw and immediately close the \n\nbreath bag with its stopper. \n(If the breath bag remains open for more than 30 seconds, the test result might be \nfalsified.) \n\n Hold the breath bag upright and stick the bar-code label marked “00-minute-value” on the \nbreath bag. \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n4. Now 200 ml of 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric acid in 200 ml water must be drunk by the \npatient without delay. \n\n5. Now the preparation of the test solution follows: \n The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is taken from the test set, opened, and filled up to \n\nthree quarters of its volume with tap water. \n Close the jar and shake it carefully until all the powder is dissolved. Pour the contents \n\ninto a drinking glass. \n Fill the 13C-urea jar to the brim with water for a second and third time and add these \n\ncontents to the drinking glass (total volume of tap water should be approximately 30 ml). \n6. This test solution must now be drunk immediately by the patient, and the time of application \n\nmust be noted. \n7. Thirty minutes after administration of the test solution (point 6), collect the 30-minute-value \n\nsample in the breath bag, which is left in the test package (Label “Sampling time: 30-minute-\nvalue”), as described under step 3. Use the bar-code label marked “30-minute-value” for this \nsample. \n\n8. Put the relevant bar-code label on the data sheet for patient documentation. Finally seal the \npackage with the sticker. \n\n9. The breath bags have to be sent in the original packaging, for analysis, to a qualified laboratory. \n \nAnalysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories \n \nThe breath samples, collected in 100 ml breath bags, are analysed by non-dispersive infrared \nspectrometry (NDIR). \n \nThe analysis of the 13C/12C-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test \nHelicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath \nanalysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas \nprecision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. \n \nIt has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. It is recommended to \nmeasure as soon as possible after the breath collection, in any case not later than 4 weeks. \n \nThe method validated in the application is as follows: \n \n Sample preparation for Infrared Spectroscopy (NDIR) \n \nThe determination of 13C/12C-ratio in the carbon dioxide of the breath samples is carried out directly in \nthe breath. The breath from the bags will be introduced into the NDIR spectrometer using a variable \ngas pump. The water content of the breath sample will be kept mostly constant through Nafion water \ntrap. For calibration and measurement necessary CO2-free air (zero-gas) will be produced via an \nintegrated CO2-absorber in the analysator. \n \n Infrared spectroscopic analysis \n \nTo analyse the carbon dioxide in breath a broad band infrared radiation bunch emitted by an infrared \nradiation source is alternately sent through the measuring chamber and a reference chamber by means \nof a beam chopper. The modulated infrared beams then enter the infrared detectors, which are double \nlayer transmission detectors with a front, and a rear chamber each filled with one of the isotopicly pure \ngases (13CO2 or 12CO2, respectively) to be measured. The infrared radiation in the measuring chamber \nis weakened by the gas component to be measured. Thus the radiation equilibrium between measuring \nand comparative beam is disturbed. In consequence there is a temperature fluctuation, which in its turn \ncauses a fluctuating pressure in the front chamber of the infrared detector. A membrane capacitor \nconnected with this chamber, which is exposed to a high resistance direct voltage, transforms these \npressure fluctuations into an alternating voltage, which is a measure of the isotopic composition of \nbreath carbon dioxide. \n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n Sample Inlet \n \nA semi-automatic sample inlet system injects the measuring gas in definite amounts into the zero gas \ncirculating in the gas circuit of the infrared spectrometer. This enables measurement of the \n13C/12C-ratio at any CO2 concentration above 1 %. \n \n Specifications for determining 13C/12C-ratios \n \nThe breath test concept is based upon the oral administration of 13C-labelled urea whose enzymatic \nhydrolysis is monitored by measuring 13CO2 in breath using non-dispersive infrared spectrometry. \n \n Infrared spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications: \n \nMultiple replicate analyses: Minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation \n \nSecurity access: Storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to \n\navoid later manipulation \n \nFor verifying the specifications linearity, stability, and precision of measurement have to be tested. \n \nZero point adjustment of the detectors by means of the zero gas generated in the spectrometer. End-\npoint adjustment of the detectors by means of calibration gases of precisely known concentration. \n \nLinearity:  0.5 ‰ for breath samples varying between 1 % and 7 % \n\nCO2-concentration \n \nStability:  0.3 ‰ at 10 consecutive pulses \n \nPrecision of measurement:  0.5 ‰ for 13C at natural abundance using a 100 ml breath bag with \n\n3 % CO2 breath concentration \n \nHelicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13C/12C of baseline-value and 30-minute-\nvalue exceeds 4.0 ‰. \n \nAlternatively, any other suitable-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively \nqualified laboratory. \n \n \n7.

These five \nprocesses take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer, which consists of three separate sections: \nthe source, flight tube, and collector. Ionisation, beam formation and acceleration all occur in the \nsource, magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector. \n \n Sample inlet \n \nFor introduction of the carbon dioxide into the analyser many sample inlet systems are available. For \nbreath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference \nstandard gas is essential. This ensures the high accuracy of this system, as calculation of the isotopic \ncontent in carbon dioxide is done with respect to an independent standard. \n \n Specifications for determining 13C/12C-ratios \n \nThe breath test concept relies on the administration of a specifically 13C-labelled urea whose \nmetabolite utilisation is monitored by measuring 13CO2 in the expired breath gas.  \n \n The mass spectrometer must be capable of: \n \nMultiple replicate analyses: Minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation \n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nSecurity access: Storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to \navoid later manipulation \n\n \nAdjustment: 13C/12C-ratio with respect to Pee Dee Beliminate (PDB) \n \nSample loop: < 200 µl \n \nThe principal tests to verify the specifications are linearity, stability (reference gas precision), and \nprecision of measurement. \n \n All mass spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications: \n \nLinearity:  0.5 ‰ for breath samples varying between 1 % and 7 % \n\nCO2-concentration \n \nStability:  0.2 ‰ on 10 consecutive pulses \n \nPrecision of measurement:  0.3 ‰ for 13C at natural abundance using a 10 ml breath sample tube \n\nwith 3 % CO2 breath concentration \n \nHelicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13C/12C of baseline-value and 30-minute-\nvalue exceeds 4.0 ‰. \n \nAlternatively, any other suitable-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively \nqualified laboratory. \n \n \n7.

DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n \n \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n 21 \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI 75 mg powder for oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne jar contains 75 mg of 13C-urea powder. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nWhite, crystalline powder for oral solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI may be used for in vivo diagnosis of gastroduodenal Helicobacter pylori \ninfection in: \n- adults, \n- adolescents, who are likely to have peptic ulcer disease. \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional and under appropriate \nmedical supervision. \n \nPosology \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI is a breath test for single administration. Patients from the age of 12 must \ntake the contents of 1 jar with 75 mg. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor performance of the test, 200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric acid in 200 ml water for patients \nfrom the age of 12 and older (as a pre-administered test meal), as well as tap water (for dissolving the \n13C-urea powder) are necessary. \n \nThe patient must have fasted for over 6 hours, preferably overnight. The test procedure takes \napproximately 40 minutes. \n \nIn case it is necessary to repeat the test procedure, this should not be done until the following day. \n \nThe suppression of Helicobacter pylori might give false negative results. Therefore the test shall be \nused after at least four weeks without systemic antibacterial therapy and two weeks after last dose of \nacid antisecretory agents. Both might interfere with the Helicobacter pylori status. This is especially \nimportant after Helicobacter eradication therapy. \n \nIt is important to follow the instructions for use adequately (see section 6.6), otherwise the reliability \nof the outcome will become questionable. \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe test must not be used in patients with documented or suspected gastric infection or atrophic \ngastritis, which might interfere with the urea breath test (see section 4.2). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nA positive test alone does not constitute indication for eradication therapy. Differential diagnosis with \ninvasive endoscopic methods might be indicated in order to examine the presence of any other \ncomplicating conditions, e.g. ulcer, autoimmune gastritis and malignancies. \n \nThere is insufficient data on the diagnostic liability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI to recommend its \nuse in patients with gastrectomy. \n \nFor children from the age of 3, Helicobacter Test INFAI for children aged 3 to 11 is available. \n \nIn individual cases of A-gastritis (atrophic gastritis) the breath test may have false positive results; \nother tests may be required to confirm the Helicobacter pylori status. \n \n\nIf the patient vomits during the test procedure, necessitating the repetition of the test, this should be \ndone in fasted condition and not before the following day (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI will be affected by all treatments interfering with Helicobacter pylori status \nor urease activity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nIt is not expected that the test procedure may be harmful during pregnancy or lactation. \nIt is recommended to take notice of the product information of eradication therapy products for their \nuse during pregnancy and lactation. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nNone known. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDue to the fact that only 75 mg of 13C-urea is delivered, an overdose is not expected. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other diagnostic agents, ATC code: VO4CX \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 23 \n\n \nFor the amount of 75 mg 13C-urea, which is administered per unit in the course of the breath test, no \npharmacodynamic activity is described. \n \nAfter oral ingestion the labelled urea reaches the gastric mucosa. In the presence of Helicobacter \npylori the 13C-urea is metabolised by the enzyme urease of Helicobacter pylori. \n \n\n2H2N(13CO)NH2 + 2H2O     Enzyme urease      4NH3 + 213CO2 \n \nThe carbon dioxide diffuses into the blood vessels. From there it is transported as bicarbonate into the \nlung and liberated as 13CO2 with the exhaled air. \n \nIn the presence of bacterial urease the ratio of the 13C/12C-carbon isotopes is significantly changed. \nThe portion of 13CO2 in the breath samples is determined by non-dispersive infrared spectrometry and \nstated as an absolute difference (-value) between the 00-minute- and the 30-minute-values. \n \nUrease is produced in the stomach only by Helicobacter pylori. Other urease producing bacteria were \nseldom found in the gastric flora. \n \nThe cut off point for discriminating Helicobacter pylori-negative and positive patients is determined to \nbe -value of 4 ‰, which means that an increase of the -value by more than 4 ‰ indicates an \ninfection. In comparison to bioptic diagnostics of an infection with Helicobacter pylori, the breath test \nachieved in clinical trials on 457 patients, a sensitivity in the range of 96.5 % to 97.9 % [95 %-CI: \n94.05 %-99.72 %], and a specificity range from 96.7 % to 100 % [95 %-CI: 94.17 %-103.63 %]. \n \nIn the absence of bacterial urease, the whole amount of the administered urea after absorption from the \ngastrointestinal tract will be metabolised like the endogenous urea. Ammonia which is produced as \ndescribed above by the bacterial hydrolysis is included into the metabolism as NH4+. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe orally applied 13C-urea is metabolised to carbon dioxide and ammonia or is integrated into the \nbody’s own urea cycle. Any increase in 13CO2 will be measured by isotopic analysis. \n \nAbsorption and distribution of 13CO2 is faster than the urease reaction. Therefore, the rate-limiting step \nin the whole process is the cleavage of 13C-urea by Helicobacter's urease. \n \nOnly in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients does the administration of 75 mg labelled urea lead to a \nsignificant increase of 13CO2 in the breath sample within the first 30 minutes. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo concerns in relation to the clinical use of the product. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nNone. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n6.3 Shelf-life \n \n3 years \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25 °C. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nA test set contains 50 jars with the additional components:  \n \n\nNo. Component Quantity \n\n1 \nJar (10 ml volume, polystyrene with polyethylene snap cap) \ncontaining 75 mg 13C-urea powder for oral solution 50 \n\n2 Data sheet for patient documentation 50 \n3 Package leaflet 50 \n4 Page of barcode labels and sticker 50 \n\n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n1. The test is to be performed in the presence of a qualified person. \n2. Each patient should be documented according to the provided data sheet. It is recommended to \n\nperform the test with the patient being in a resting position. \n3. The test starts with the collection of samples for the determination of baseline-value (00-minute-\n\nvalue): \n Take the straw and the breath sample containers (tubes or breath bag) with the label \n\n“Sampling time: 00-minute-value” out of the test set. \n Remove the stopper from one of the breath sample containers (tube or breath bag), \n\nunwrap the straw and place the straw into the container. \n Now the patient breathes gently through the straw into the breath sample container. \n By continuously breathing the patient must pull out the straw and immediately close the \n\nbreath sample container (tube or breath bag) with its stopper. \n(If the breath sample container remains open for more than 30 seconds, the test result \nmight be falsified.) \n\n Hold the sample tube or breath bag upright and stick the bar-code label marked \n“00-minute-value” on the container. \n\n4. Fill up the second sample tube (Label “Sampling time: 00-minute-value”) with breath by \nfollowing the same procedure. For infrared analysis, only one breath bag is used. \n\n5. Now 200 ml of 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric acid in 200 ml water must be drunk by the \npatient without delay. \n\n6. Now the preparation of the test solution follows: \n The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is taken from the test set, opened, and filled up to \n\nthree quarters of its volume with tap water. \n Close the jar and shake it carefully until all the powder is dissolved. Pour the contents \n\ninto a drinking glass. \n Fill the 13C-urea jar to the brim with water for a second and third time and add these \n\ncontents to the drinking glass (total volume of tap water should be approximately 30 ml). \n7. This test solution must now be drunk immediately by the patient, and the time of application \n\nmust be noted. \n8. Thirty minutes after administration of the test solution (point 7), collect the 30-minute-value \n\nsamples in the breath sample container (tube or breath bags) (Label “Sampling time: 30-minute-\nvalue”), as described under steps 3 to 4. Use the bar-code labels marked “30-minute-value” for \nthese samples. \n\n9. Put the relevant bar-code label on the data sheet for patient documentation. Finally seal the \npackage with the sticker. \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n10. The breath sample containers (tube or breath bags) have to be sent for analysis, to a qualified \nlaboratory. \n\n \nAnalysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories for infrared analyzer or mass \nspectrometry (IRMS) \n \nInfrared spectroscopy (NDIR) \n \nThe breath samples, collected in 100 ml breath bags, are analysed by non-dispersive infrared \nspectrometry (NDIR). \n \nThe analysis of the 13C/12C-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test \nHelicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath \nanalysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas \nprecision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. \n \nIt has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. It is recommended to \nmeasure as soon as possible after the breath collection, in any case not later than 4 weeks. \n \nThe method validated in the application is as follows: \n \n Sample preparation for Infrared Spectroscopy (NDIR) \n \nThe determination of 13C/12C-ratio in the carbon dioxide of the breath samples is carried out directly in \nthe breath. The breath from the bags will be introduced into the NDIR spectrometer using a variable \ngas pump. The water content of the breath sample will be kept mostly constant through Nafion water \ntrap. For calibration and measurement necessary CO2-free air (zero-gas) will be produced via an \nintegrated CO2-absorber in the analysator. \n \n Infrared spectroscopic analysis \n \nTo analyse the carbon dioxide in breath a broad band infrared radiation bunch emitted by an infrared \nradiation source is alternately sent through the measuring chamber and a reference chamber by means \nof a beam chopper. The modulated infrared beams then enter the infrared detectors, which are double \nlayer transmission detectors with a front, and a rear chamber each filled with one of the isotopicly pure \ngases (13CO2 or 12CO2, respectively) to be measured. The infrared radiation in the measuring chamber \nis weakened by the gas component to be measured. Thus the radiation equilibrium between measuring \nand comparative beam is disturbed. In consequence there is a temperature fluctuation, which in its turn \ncauses a fluctuating pressure in the front chamber of the infrared detector. A membrane capacitor \nconnected with this chamber, which is exposed to a high resistance direct voltage, transforms these \npressure fluctuations into an alternating voltage, which is a measure of the isotopic composition of \nbreath carbon dioxide. \n \n Sample Inlet \n \nA semi-automatic sample inlet system injects the measuring gas in definite amounts into the zero gas \ncirculating in the gas circuit of the infrared spectrometer. This enables measurement of the \n13C/12C-ratio at any CO2 concentration above 1 %. \n \n Specifications for determining 13C/12C-ratios \n \nThe breath test concept is based upon the oral administration of 13C-labelled urea whose enzymatic \nhydrolysis is monitored by measuring 13CO2 in breath using non-dispersive infrared spectrometry. \n \n Infrared spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications: \n \nMultiple replicate analyses: Minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation \n\n\n\n 26 \n\n \nSecurity access: Storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to \n\navoid later manipulation \n \nFor verifying the specifications linearity, stability, and precision of measurement have to be tested. \n \nZero point adjustment of the detectors by means of the zero gas generated in the spectrometer. End-\npoint adjustment of the detectors by means of calibration gases of precisely known concentration. \n \nLinearity:  0.5 ‰ for breath samples varying between 1 % and 7 % \n\nCO2-concentration \n \nStability:  0.3 ‰ at 10 consecutive pulses \n \nPrecision of measurement:  0.5 ‰ for 13C at natural abundance using a 100 ml breath bag with \n\n3 % CO2 breath concentration \n \nHelicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13C/12C of baseline-value and 30-minute-\nvalue exceeds 4.0 ‰. \n \nAlternatively, any other suitable-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively \nqualified laboratory. \n \nMass spectrometry (IRMS) \n \nThe breath samples, collected in 10 ml glass- or plastic sample tubes, are analysed by isotope ratio \nmass spectrometry (IRMS). \n \nThe analysis of the 13C/12C-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test \nHelicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath \nanalysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas \nprecision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. \n \nIt has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. The method validated in \nthe application is as follows: \n \n Sample preparation for (IRMS) \n \nTo determine the 13C/12C-ratio of carbon dioxide in breath by mass spectrometric analysis the carbon \ndioxide must be separated from the breath and introduced into the mass spectrometer. The automatic \npreparation system for isotope mass spectrometers which is dedicated for breath test analysis is based \non a gas-chromatographic continuous flow separation technique. \n \nWater is removed from the sample by means of a Nafion water trap or the gas-chromatographic \npreparation system that separates the individual gases in a gas chromatographic column with Helium \nas eluent. Passing the column the separated gas species of breath are detected by an ionisation \ndetector. The fraction of carbon dioxide gas, identified by its characteristic retention time, is \nintroduced into mass spectrometer. \n \n Mass spectrometric analysis \n \nTo analyse the separated carbon dioxide sample gas its molecules must be ionised, formed into a \nbeam, accelerated by an electric field, deflected in a magnetic field, and finally detected. These five \nprocesses take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer, which consists of three separate sections: \nthe source, flight tube, and collector. Ionisation, beam formation and acceleration all occur in the \nsource, magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector. \n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n Sample inlet \n \nFor introduction of the carbon dioxide into the analyser many sample inlet systems are available. For \nbreath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference \nstandard gas is essential.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Helicobacter Test INFAI is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Helicobacter Test INFAI  \n3. How to take Helicobacter Test INFAI  \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Helicobacter Test INFAI  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Helicobacter Test INFAI is and what it is used for \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI is for diagnostic use only. It is a breath test for adolescents from the age \nof 12 and adults to determine the presence of bacterium Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. \n \nWhy do you need to take the Helicobacter Test INFAI? \nYou may have a gastric infection caused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Your doctor has \nrecommended that you have a Helicobacter Test INFAI for one of the following reasons: \n \n\n Your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from Helicobacter pylori infection to \nhelp diagnose your condition. \n\n \n You have already been determined as being infected with Helicobacter pylori and have been \n\ntaking medication aimed to clear up the infection. Your doctor now wishes to find out if the \ntreatment has been successful. \n\n \nHow does the test work? \nAll foods contain a substance called carbon-13 (13C). This carbon-13 can be detected in the carbon \ndioxide you breathe out of your lungs. The actual amount of carbon-13 in the breath will depend on \nthe kind of food that you have eaten. \n \nYou will be asked to drink the “test meal”. Following the meal, samples of your breath will be taken. \nSee “Special instructions for use”. These samples will be analysed to measure the “normal” amount of \ncarbon-13 content in the carbon dioxide in your breath. \n \nYou will then be asked to drink a solution of carbon-13-urea. Further samples of your breath will then \nbe taken 30 minutes later and the amount of carbon-13 in the samples measured as before. The results \nwill be compared and a significant increase in the amount of carbon-13 in the second set of samples \nwill suggest to your doctor that Helicobacter pylori is present. \n \n \n\n\n\n 52 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Helicobacter Test INFAI \n \nDo not take Helicobacter Test INFAI \n if you have or suspect that you have a stomach infection or a certain inflammation of the \n\nstomach lining (atrophic gastritis). \nThis inflammation of the stomach lining may cause incorrect positive results of your breath test. \nFurther investigations may be required to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Helicobacter Test INFAI if you have any condition \nthat can affect or be affected by the test. \n \nEven if the result of Helicobacter Test INFAI is positive, further tests might be necessary before a \ntreatment of a Helicobacter pylori infection may be started. These are required to check for the \npresence of any other complications, such as: \n stomach ulcer \n inflammation of the stomach lining caused by immune system \n tumours \n \nThere is insufficient data on the reliability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI for recommending its use in \npatients with removal of parts of the stomach. \n \nIf the patient vomits during the test procedure, repetition of the test is necessary. This should be done \nin fasted condition and not before the following day. \n \nOther medicines and Helicobacter Test INFAI \nHelicobacter Test INFAI is influenced by medicines influencing  \n Helicobacter pylori (see section 3, second paragraph under “Method of use”) \n the enzyme urease, which stimulate the reduction of urea \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIt is not expected that performing the breath test during pregnancy and lactation has a damaging effect. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHelicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Helicobacter Test INFAI \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nYou should perform the test in the presence of your doctor or another qualified person. \n \nThe recommended dose is \nPatients from the age of 12 must take the content of one jar for one test. \n \nMethod of use \nYou must have fasted for 6 hours before application, preferably overnight. Ask your doctor, if fasting \nis a problem, for example for diabetic patients. \n \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nThe test procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes. \n \nThe test should be performed following at least: \n 4 weeks after a therapy against a bacterial infection  \n 2 weeks after the last administration of a medicine to reduce release of stomach acid \nBoth groups of medicines could influence the results of the Helicobacter Test INFAI. This is \nparticularly after a therapy to remove Helicobacter pylori. It is important to follow the instructions for \nuse exactly, otherwise the result may be questionable. \n \nEssential items not supplied with Helicobacter Test INFAI \nBefore the breath test is performed a liquid test meal is taken to delay the stomach from emptying. The \ntest meal is not provided within the kit. The following are suitable test meals: \n 200 ml 100 % orange juice or \n 1 g citric acid dissolved in 200 ml water \nIf you cannot take either of these test meals, please tell your doctor, who will suggest an alternative. A \ndrinking vessel and tap water is required to dissolve the 13C-urea powder. If the test needs to be \nrepeated, this should be done on the following day at the earliest. \n \nSpecial instructions for use (for mass spectrometry) \nThe test is to be performed after instruction by a healthcare professional and under appropriate \nmedical supervision. The patient data should be documented using the provided data sheet. It is \nrecommended that you take the test in a resting position. \n \n1. The test should be carried out after having fasted 6 hours before application, preferably \n\novernight. If the test needs to be carried out later in the day, only a light meal like tea and toast \nis recommended. \n\n2. The test begins with the collection of samples for determining the baseline values: \n The straw and sample tubes labelled “sampling time: 00-minute-value” are taken from the \n\ntest set. \n The stopper is removed from one of the sample containers and place the unwrapped straw \n\ninto the container. \n Now the patient breathes gently through the straw into the sample tube until the inside of \n\nthe sample tube steams up. \n The patient must continue to breathe through the straw while removing it from the sample \n\ntube, and then immediately seal the tube with its stopper. \nIf the sample tube remains open for more than 30 seconds, the result could be inaccurate. \n\n The sample container should be held upright and the bar-code label marked “00-minute-\nvalue” will be stuck round the sample container so that the lines of the bar code are \nhorizontal. \n\n3. Now the second sample container (labelled “sampling time: 00-minute-value”) has to be filled \nup with breath in the same way as described above. \n\n4. Then the patient must drink the recommended test meal (200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric \nacid in 200 ml water). \n\n5. Now the preparation of the test solution follows. \n The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is removed from the test set, opened, and filled up to \n\nabout three quarters with tap water. \n The jar is closed and carefully shaken until all the powder has dissolved completely. \n The contents are poured into a drinking glass, the jar filled a second and third time with \n\nwater and the contents transferred into the drinking glass, so that approximately 30 ml of \ntest solution is obtained. \n\n6. The patient should drink this test solution immediately. The time of intake must be noted. \n7. 30 minutes after the test solution has been taken (point 6), the “30-minute-value” samples are \n\ncollected in both containers, which remain in the pack (labelled “sampling time: 30-minute-\nvalue”) as described under points 2 and 3. \nThe bar-code labels marked “30-minute-value” must be used for these samples. \n\n\n\n 54 \n\n8. The corresponding bar-code label must be put on the data sheet for patient documentation. All \nbreath sample containers should be placed back into the original packaging. This packaging \nshould be sealed with the remaining sticker. \n\n9. The package must be sent to a qualified laboratory for analysis. \n \nMedical or healthcare professionals can find detailed information on the analysis of breath samples and \nthe testing specifications for laboratories, in section 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \nIf you take more Helicobacter Test INFAI than you should \nBecause only 75 mg 13C-urea is provided overdose is not to be expected. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nNo side effects are known. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. You can also report side effects directly \nvia the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide \nmore information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Helicobacter Test INFAI \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store above 25C. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

This should be done \nin fasted condition and not before the following day. \n \nOther medicines and Helicobacter Test INFAI \nHelicobacter Test INFAI is influenced by medicines influencing \n Helicobacter pylori (see section 3, second paragraph under “Method of use”) \n the enzyme urease, which stimulate the reduction of urea \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIt is not expected that performing the breath test during pregnancy and lactation has a damaging effect. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHelicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Helicobacter Test INFAI \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nYou should perform the test in the presence of your doctor or another qualified person. \n \n\nThe recommended dose is \nPatients from the age of 12 must take the content of one jar for one test. \n \nMethod of use \nYou must have fasted for 6 hours before application, preferably overnight. Ask your doctor, if fasting \nis a problem, for example for diabetic patients. \n \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nThe test procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes. \n \nThe test should be performed following at least: \n 4 weeks after a therapy against a bacterial infection  \n 2 weeks after the last administration of a medicine to reduce release of stomach acid \nBoth groups of medicines could influence the results of the Helicobacter Test INFAI. This is \nparticularly after a therapy to remove Helicobacter pylori. It is important to follow the instructions for \nuse exactly, otherwise the result may be questionable. \n \nEssential items not supplied with Helicobacter Test INFAI \nBefore the breath test is performed a liquid test meal is taken to delay the stomach from emptying. The \ntest meal is not provided within the kit. The following are suitable test meals: \n 200 ml 100 % orange juice or \n 1 g citric acid dissolved in 200 ml water \nIf you cannot take either of these test meals, please tell your doctor, who will suggest an alternative. A \ndrinking vessel and tap water is required to dissolve the 13C-urea powder. If the test needs to be \nrepeated, this should be done on the following day at the earliest. \n \nSpecial instructions for use (for infrared spectroscopy) \nThe test is to be performed after instruction by a healthcare professional and under appropriate \nmedical supervision. The patient data should be documented using the provided data sheet. It is \nrecommended that you take the test in a resting position. \n \n1. The test should be carried out after having fasted 6 hours before application, preferably \n\novernight. If the test needs to be carried out later in the day, only a light meal like tea and toast \nis recommended. \n\n2. The test begins with the collection of samples for determining the baseline values: \n The straw and the breath bag labelled “sampling time: 00-minute-value” are taken from \n\nthe test set. \n The stopper is removed from the breath bag and place the unwrapped straw into the \n\nbreath bag. \n Now the patient breathes gently through the straw into the breath bag. \n The patient must continue to breathe through the straw while removing it from the breath \n\nbag, and then immediately seal the breath bag with its stopper. \nIf the breath bag remains open for more than 30 seconds, the result could be inaccurate. \n\n The breath bag should be held upright and the bar-code label marked “00-minute-value” \nwill be stuck on the breath bag. \n\n3. Then the patient must drink the recommended test meal (200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric \nacid in 200 ml water). \n\n4. Now the preparation of the test solution follows. \n The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is removed from the test set, opened, and filled up to \n\nabout three quarters with tap water. \n The jar is closed and carefully shaken until all the powder has dissolved completely. \n The contents are poured into a drinking glass, the jar filled a second and third time with \n\nwater and the contents transferred into the drinking glass, so that approximately 30 ml of \ntest solution is obtained. \n\n5. The patient should drink this test solution immediately. The time of intake must be noted. \n6. 30 minutes after the test solution has been taken (point 5), the “30-minute-value” sample is \n\ncollected in the breath bag, which remains in the pack (labelled “sampling time: 30-minute-\nvalue”) as described under point 2. \nThe bar-code label marked “30-minute-value” must be used for this sample. \n\n7. The corresponding bar-code label must be put on the data sheet for patient documentation. All \nbreath bags should be placed back into the original packaging. This packaging should be sealed \nwith the remaining sticker. \n\n8. The package must be sent to a qualified laboratory for analysis. \n \n\n\n\n 60 \n\nMedical or healthcare professionals can find detailed information on the analysis of breath samples and \nthe testing specifications for laboratories, in section 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \nIf you take more Helicobacter Test INFAI than you should \nBecause only 75 mg 13C-urea is provided overdose is not to be expected. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nNo side effects are known. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. You can also report side effects directly \nvia the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide \nmore information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Helicobacter Test INFAI \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store above 25C. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3 to 11 is and what it is used for \n \nHelicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 is for diagnostic use only. It is a breath test for \nchildren aged 3-11 years to determine the presence of bacterium Helicobacter pylori in the \nstomach or duodenum. \n \nWhy do you need to take the Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11? \nYou may have a gastric or duodenum infection caused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Your \ndoctor has recommended that you have a Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 for one \nof the following reasons: \n \n\n Your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from Helicobacter pylori infection to \nhelp diagnose your condition. \n\n \n You have already been determined as being infected with Helicobacter pylori and have been \n\ntaking medication aimed to clear up the infection. Your doctor now wishes to find out if the \ntreatment has been successful. \n\n \nHow does the test work? \nAll foods contain a substance called carbon-13 (13C). This carbon-13 can be detected in the carbon \ndioxide you breathe out of your lungs. The actual amount of carbon-13 in the breath will depend on \nthe kind of food that you have eaten. \n \nYou will be asked to drink the “test meal”. Following the meal, samples of your breath will be taken. \nSee “Special instructions for use”. These samples will be analysed to measure the “normal” amount of \ncarbon-13 content in the carbon dioxide in your breath. \n \nYou will then be asked to drink a solution of carbon-13-urea. Further samples of your breath will then \nbe taken 30 minutes later and the amount of carbon-13 in the samples measured as before. The results \nwill be compared and a significant increase in the amount of carbon-13 in the second set of samples \nwill suggest to your doctor that Helicobacter pylori is present. \n \n \n\n\n\n 64 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the \nage 3-11 \n\n \nDo not take Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 \n if you have or suspect that you have a stomach infection or a certain inflammation of the \n\nstomach lining (atrophic gastritis). \nThis inflammation of the stomach lining may cause incorrect positive results of your breath test. \nFurther investigations may be required to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 \nif you have any condition that can affect or be affected by the test. \n \nEven if the result of Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 is positive, further tests \nmight be necessary before a treatment of a Helicobacter pylori infection may be started.

This should be done \nin fasted condition and not before the following day. \n \nOther medicines and Helicobacter Test INFAI \nHelicobacter Test INFAI is influenced by medicines influencing \n Helicobacter pylori (see section 3, second paragraph under “Method of use”) \n the enzyme urease, which stimulate the reduction of urea \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nIt is not expected that performing the breath test during pregnancy and lactation has a damaging effect. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHelicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Helicobacter Test INFAI \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nYou should perform the test in the presence of your doctor or another qualified person. \n \nThe recommended dose is \nPatients from the age of 12 must take the content of one jar for one test. \n \nMethod of use \nYou must have fasted for 6 hours before application, preferably overnight. Ask your doctor, if fasting \nis a problem, for example for diabetic patients. \n \nThe test procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes. \n\n\n\n 71 \n\n \nThe test should be performed following at least: \n 4 weeks after a therapy against a bacterial infection \n 2 weeks after the last administration of a medicine to reduce release of stomach acid \nBoth groups of medicines could influence the results of the Helicobacter Test INFAI. This is \nparticularly after a therapy to remove Helicobacter pylori. It is important to follow the instructions for \nuse exactly, otherwise the result may be questionable. \n \nEssential items not supplied with Helicobacter Test INFAI \nBefore the breath test is performed a liquid test meal is taken to delay the stomach from emptying. The \ntest meal is not provided within the kit. The following are suitable test meals: \n 200 ml 100 % orange juice or  \n 1 g citric acid dissolved in 200 ml water \nIf you cannot take either of these test meals, please tell your doctor, who will suggest an alternative. A \ndrinking vessel and tap water is required to dissolve the 13C-urea powder. If the test needs to be \nrepeated, this should be done on the following day at the earliest. \n \nSpecial instructions for use (for infrared spectroscopy or mass spectrometry) \nThe test is to be performed after instruction by a healthcare professional and under appropriate \nmedical supervision. The patient data should be documented using the provided data sheet. It is \nrecommended that you take the test in a resting position. \n \n1. The test should be carried out after having fasted 6 hours before application, preferably \n\novernight. If the test needs to be carried out later in the day, only a light meal like tea and toast \nis recommended. \n\n2. For mass spectrometric analysis, please use sample tubes for collection the breath samples; for \ninfrared spectroscopy, use breath bags. Both are not included in the package. \n\n3. The test begins with the collection of samples for determining the baseline values: \n Use the straw and the breath sample container described under point 2 labelled “sampling \n\ntime: 00-minute-value”. \n The stopper is removed from one of the breath sample containers described under point 2 \n\nand place the unwrapped straw into the breath sample container. \n Now the patient breathes gently through the straw into the breath sample container. \n The patient must continue to breathe through the straw while removing it from the breath \n\nsample container, and then immediately seal the breath sample container with its stopper. \nIf the breath sample container remains open for more than 30 seconds, the result could be \ninaccurate. \n\n The breath sample container should be held upright and the bar-code label marked \n“00-minute-value” will be stuck on the breath sample container. \n\n4. Now the second breath sample container (labelled “sampling time: 00-minute-value”) has to be \nfilled up with breath in the same way as described above. The second breath sample container is \nonly required for mass spectrometry. For infrared spectroscopy, only one breath bag is required. \n\n5. Then the patient must drink the recommended test meal (200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric \nacid in 200 ml water). \n\n6. Now the preparation of the test solution follows. \n The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is removed from the pack, opened, and filled up to \n\nabout three quarters with tap water. \n The jar is closed and carefully shaken until all the powder has dissolved completely. \n The contents are poured into a drinking glass, the jar filled a second and third time with \n\nwater and the contents transferred into the drinking glass, so that approximately 30 ml of \ntest solution is obtained. \n\n7. The patient should drink this test solution immediately. The time of intake must be noted. \n8. 30 minutes after the test solution has been taken (point 7), the “30-minute-value” samples are \n\ncollected in the breath sample containers labelled “sampling time: 30-minute-value” as \ndescribed under point 3 and 4. \nThe bar-code labels marked “30-minute-value” must be used for these samples. \n\n\n\n 72 \n\n9. The corresponding bar-code label must be put on the data sheet for patient documentation. \n10. All breath sample containers and the patient documentation must be sent to a qualified \n\nlaboratory for analysis. \n \nMedical or healthcare professionals can find detailed information on the analysis of breath samples and \nthe testing specifications for laboratories, in section 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \nIf you take more Helicobacter Test INFAI than you should \nBecause only 75 mg 13C-urea is provided overdose is not to be expected. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nNo side effects are known. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. You can also report side effects directly \nvia the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide \nmore information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.
