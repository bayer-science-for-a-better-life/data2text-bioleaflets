NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nADASUVE 4.5 mg inhalation powder, pre-dispensed \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach single-dose inhaler contains 5 mg loxapine and delivers 4.5 mg loxapine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed (inhalation powder). \n\n \n\nWhite device with a mouthpiece on one end and a pull-tab protruding from the other end. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nADASUVE is indicated for the rapid control of mild-to-moderate agitation in adult patients with \n\nschizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Patients should receive regular treatment immediately after control \n\nof acute agitation symptoms. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nADASUVE should only be administered in a hospital-setting under the supervision of a healthcare \n\nprofessional. \n\n \n\nShort-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator treatment should be available for treatment of possible \n\nsevere respiratory side-effects (bronchospasm).  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended initial dose of ADASUVE is 9.1 mg. As this dose cannot be reach with this \n\npresentation (ADASUVE 4.5 mg), the presentation ADASUVE 9.1 mg should be used initially. A \n\nsecond dose can be given after 2 hours, if necessary. No more than two doses should be administered.  \n\n \n\nA lower dose of 4.5 mg may be given if the 9.1 mg dose was not previously tolerated by the patient or \n\nif the physician decides a lower dose is more appropriate.   \n\n \n\nPatient should be observed during the first hour after each dose for signs and symptoms of \n\nbronchospasm. \n\n \n\n  \n\nElderly \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in patients older than 65 years of age have not been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n\nADASUVE has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No data are available. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in children (less than 18 years of age) have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nInhalation use. The product is packaged in a sealed pouch.  \n\n \n\nWhen needed, the product is removed from the pouch. Once the pull-tab is removed, a green light \n\nturns on, indicating the product is ready for use (Note: the product must be used within 15 minutes of \n\npulling the tab). To deliver the medicinal product, the patient inhales through the mouthpiece with a \n\nsteady deep breath. Upon completion of the inhalation, the patient removes the mouthpiece from \n\nmouth and holds breath briefly. The medicinal product has been delivered when the green light turns \n\noff. The device exterior may become warm during use. This is normal. \n\n \n\nFor complete instructions on how to use ADASUVE see information for the healthcare professional \n\nsection of the package leaflet. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to amoxapine. \n\n \n\nPatients with acute respiratory signs/symptoms (e.g., wheezing) or with active airways disease (such \n\nas patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nCorrect use of ADASUVE inhaler is important for administration of the full dose of loxapine. \n\nHealthcare professionals should ensure the patient will use the inhaler properly. \n\n \n\nADASUVE may have limited effectiveness when patients are on concomitant medicinal products, \n\npredominantly other antipsychotics.  \n\n \n\nBronchospasm \n\n \n\nIn placebo-controlled clinical trials in subjects with asthma or COPD, bronchospasm was very \n\ncommonly observed. When it occurred, it was typically reported within 25 minutes after dosing. \n\nConsequently, patients receiving ADASUVE should be observed as appropriate following dosing. \n\nADASUVE has not been investigated in patients with other forms of lung disease. Should \n\nbronchospasm occur after treatment with ADASUVE, it can be treated with a short-acting beta-agonist \n\nbronchodilator, e.g., salbutamol (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). ADASUVE should not be re-administered \n\nin patients who develop any respiratory signs/symptoms (see section 4.3). \n \n\nHypoventilation \n\n \n\nGiven the primary Central Nervous System (CNS) effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used \n\nwith caution in patients with compromised respiration, such as hypovigilant patients or patients with \n\nCNS-depression due to alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most \n\nantipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n\n \n\nADASUVE has not been studied in elderly patients, including those with dementia-related psychosis. \n\nClinical studies with both atypical and conventional antipsychotic medicinal products have \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\ndemonstrated that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis are at an increased risk of death \n\ncompared to placebo. ADASUVE is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related \n\npsychosis.  \n\n \n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms \n\n \n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (including acute dystonia) are known class effects for antipsychotics. \n\nADASUVE should be used with caution in patients with a known history of extrapyramidal \n\nsymptoms. \n\n \n\nTardive dyskinesia \n\n \n\nIf signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient being treated with loxapine, \n\ndiscontinuation should be considered. These symptoms can temporally worsen or can even arise after \n\ndiscontinuation of treatment. \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) \n\n \n\nClinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence \n\nof autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac \n\ndysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria \n\n(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of \n\nNMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, \n\nADASUVE must be discontinued.  \n\n \n\nHypotension \n\n \n\nMild hypotension was reported in short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in agitated patients \n\nadministered ADASUVE. If vasopressor therapy is required, noradrenaline or phenylephrine is \n\npreferred. Adrenaline should not be used, since beta-adrenoceptor stimulation may worsen \n\nhypotension in the setting of loxapine-induced partial alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\n \n\nNo data are available on the use of ADASUVE in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. \n\nADASUVE is not recommended in patient populations with known cardiovascular disease (history of \n\nmyocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), \n\ncerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \n\nhypovolaemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products). \n\n \n\nQT interval \n\n \n\nClinically relevant QT prolongation does not appear to be associated with single and repeat doses of \n\nADASUVE. Caution should be exercised when ADASUVE is administered in patients with known \n\ncardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other \n\nmedicinal products known to prolong the QT interval. The potential risk of QTc prolongation due to \n\ninteraction with medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval is unknown.  \n\n \n\nSeizures / convulsions \n\n \n\nLoxapine should be used with caution in patients with a history of convulsive disorders since it lowers \n\nthe convulsive threshold. Seizures have been reported in patients receiving oral loxapine at \n\nantipsychotic dose levels, and may occur in epileptic patients even with maintenance of routine \n\nanticonvulsant drug therapy (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nAnticholinergic activity \n\n \n\nBecause of anticholinergic action, ADASUVE should be used cautiously in patients with glaucoma or \n\na tendency to urinary retention, particularly with concomitant administration of anticholinergic-type \n\nantiparkinson medicinal products. \n\n \n\nIntoxication or physical disease (delirium) \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ADASUVE has not been evaluated in patients with agitation due to \n\nintoxication or physical disease (delirium). ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who \n\nare intoxicated or delirious (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of benzodiazepines or other hypnosedatives or respiratory depressants \n\nmay be associated with excessive sedation and respiratory depression or respiratory failure. If \n\nbenzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to loxapine, patients should be monitored for \n\nexcessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension.  \n\n \n\nA study of inhaled loxapine and intramuscular lorazepam 1 mg in combination found no significant \n\neffects on respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, or heart rate compared with either drug \n\nadministered alone. Higher doses of lorazepam have not been studied. The effects of the combination \n\non sedation appeared to be additive. \n\n \n\nPotential for ADASUVE to affect other medicinal products \n\n \n\nLoxapine is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal \n\nproducts that are either metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes or glucuronidated by \n\nhuman uridine 5\u2019-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGTs).  \n\n \n\nCaution is advised if loxapine is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the seizure \n\nthreshold, e.g. phenothiazines or butyrophenones, clozapine, tricyclics or selective serotonine reuptake \n\ninhibitors (SSRIs), tramadol, mefloquine (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicated that loxapine was not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but does inhibit \n\nP-gp. At therapeutic concentrations, however, it is not expected to inhibit P-gp-mediated transport of \n\nother medicinal products in a clinically significant manner. \n\n \n\nGiven the primary CNS effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used with caution in combination \n\nwith alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most antipsychotics, \n\nhypnotics, opiates, etc. The use of loxapine in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication \n\n(either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products) has not been evaluated. Loxapine may cause \n\nsevere respiratory depression if combined with other CNS-depressants (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ADASUVE \n\n \n\nLoxapine is a substrate for flavin-containing mono-oxygenases (FMOs), and for several CYP450 \n\nisozymes (see section 5.2). Therefore, the risk of metabolic interactions caused by an effect on an \n\nindividual isoform is limited. Caution should be used in patients receiving concomitant treatment with \n\nother medicinal products that are either inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, particularly if the \n\nconcomitant medicinal product is known to inhibit or induce several of the enzymes involved in \n\nloxapine metabolism. Such medicinal products may modify efficacy and safety of ADASUVE in an \n\nirregular manner. Concomitant use of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, \n\npropranolol and refecoxib) should be avoided, if possible. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nAdrenaline \n\n \n\nCo-administration of loxapine and adrenaline may cause worsening of hypotension (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nNew-born infants exposed repeatedly to antipsychotics during the third trimester of pregnancy are at \n\nrisk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in \n\nseverity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, \n\ntremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, monitoring of new-borns \n\nshould be considered. ADASUVE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit \n\njustifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nThe extent of the excretion of loxapine or its metabolites in human milk is not known. However, \n\nloxapine and its metabolites have been shown to be transported into the milk of lactating dogs. \n\nPatients should be advised not to breast feed for a period of 48 hours after receiving loxapine and \n\ndiscard the milk produced in the meantime. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo loxapine specific human data on fertility are available. It is known that in humans, long-term \n\ntreatment with antipsychotics may lead to loss of libido and amenorrhoea. In female rats, reproductive \n\neffects have been observed (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\n ADASUVE has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Because of the potential for \n\nsedation/somnolence, fatigue, or dizziness, patients should not operate hazardous machines, including \n\nmotor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that loxapine has not affected them adversely (see \n\nsection 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAssessment of adverse reactions from clinical study data is based on two Phase 3 and one Phase 2A \n\nshort-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolling 524 adult patients with agitation \n\nassociated with schizophrenia (including 27 patients with schizoaffective disorder) or bipolar disorder, \n\ntreated with ADASUVE 4.5 mg (265 patients) or ADASUVE 9.1 mg (259 patients). \n\n \n\nIn studies in agitated patients, bronchospasm was reported as an uncommon, but serious adverse \n\nreaction, while in subjects with active airways disease, bronchospasm was commonly reported and \n\noften required treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator. The most commonly reported \n\nadverse reactions during treatment with ADASUVE were dysgeusia, sedation/somnolence and \n\ndizziness (dizziness was more common after placebo treatment than loxapine treatment).  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions listed below are categorized using the following convention: Very common (\u2265 \n\n1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \n\nvery rare (< 1/10,000). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n\nMedDRA system organ classification \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common: sedation/somnolence \n\nCommon: dizziness \n\nUncommon: dystonia, dyskinesia, oculogyration, tremor, akathisia/restlessness \n\nVascular disorders \n\nUncommon: hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nCommon: throat irritation \n\nUncommon: bronchospasm (including shortness of breath) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common: dysgeusia \n\nCommon: dry mouth \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nBronchospasm \n\n \n\nIn short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in patients with agitation associated with \n\nschizophrenia or bipolar disorder without active airways disease, bronchospasm (which includes \n\nreports of wheezing, shortness of breath or cough) was uncommon in patients treated with \n\nADASUVE. However, in placebo-controlled clinical trials in subjects with mild-to-moderate \n\npersistent asthma or moderate-to-severe COPD, adverse reactions of bronchospasm were reported very \n\ncommonly. Most of these events occurred within 25 minutes of dosing, were mild to moderate in \n\nseverity, and could be relieved with an inhaled bronchodilator. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions seen with chronic oral loxapine use \n\n \n\nWith chronic oral administration of loxapine, the reported adverse reactions include sedation and \n\ndrowsiness; extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tremor, akathisia, rigidity, and dystonia); cardiovascular \n\neffects (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, light-headedness, and \n\nsyncope); and anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry eyes, blurred vision, and urinary retention). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo cases of overdosage of ADASUVE were reported in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nSymptoms  \n\n \n\nIn the event of accidental overdosage, signs and symptoms will depend on the number of units taken \n\nand individual patient tolerance. As would be expected from the pharmacologic actions of loxapine, \n\nthe clinical findings may range from mild depression of the CNS and cardiovascular systems to \n\nprofound hypotension, respiratory depression, and unconsciousness (see section 4.4). The possibility \n\nof occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms and/or convulsive seizures should be kept in mind. Renal \n\nfailure following oral loxapine overdosage has also been reported.  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThe treatment of overdosage is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Severe hypotension might be \n\nexpected to respond to the administration of noradrenaline or phenylephrine. Adrenaline should not be \n\nused since its use in a patient with partial adrenergic blockage may further lower the blood pressure \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Severe extrapyramidal reactions should be treated with anticholinergic \n\nantiparkinson medicinal products or diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and anticonvulsant therapy \n\nshould be initiated as indicated. Additional measures include oxygen and intravenous fluids. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptics, antipsychotics; ATC code: N05AH01 \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of loxapine is proposed to be mediated through high affinity antagonism of dopamine D2 \n\nreceptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Loxapine binds with noradrenergic, histaminergic, and \n\ncholinergic receptors, and its interaction with these systems may influence the spectrum of its \n\npharmacological effects. \n\n \n\nChanges in the level of excitability of subcortical inhibitory areas have been observed in several \n\nanimal species, associated with calming effects and suppression of aggressive behaviour. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy  \n\n \n\nIn the two Phase 3 studies patients were enrolled who had acute agitation of at least moderate level (14 \n\nor higher on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Excited Component (PEC) scale (poor \n\nimpulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement). Inclusion in Study 004-301 \n\nrequired a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Inclusion in Study 004-302 required a diagnosis of bipolar \n\ndisorder (current episode manic or mixed). Patients had significant and long-standing psychiatric \n\ndisease (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)), based on \n\nyears since diagnosis and previous hospitalizations. Patients were randomised to placebo, ADASUVE \n\n4.5 mg and ADASUVE 9.1 mg.  \n\n \n\nThe mean age of randomized patients was 43.1 years in Study 004-301 and 40.8 years in Study \n\n004-302: young adults (18-25 years old) were scarcely (7.3%) represented in either trial. Women in \n\nthe schizophrenia trial were scarcely represented (26.5%), and about half of the patients were male \n\n(49.7%) in Study 004-302. About 35% of the patients with schizophrenia were taking concomitant \n\nantipsychotics at the time of dosing while approximately 13% of the patients with bipolar disorder \n\nwere taking these drugs. A majority of the patients in both Phase 3 studies were smokers with about \n\n82% of the patients with schizophrenia and 74% of the patients with bipolar disorder currently \n\nsmoking. \n\n \n\nAfter the first dose, a second dose was administered at least 2 hours later if the agitation had not \n\nsubsided sufficiently. A third dose was administered if needed after at least 4 hours after dose 2. \n\nRescue medication (intramuscular lorazepam) was given if medically required. Primary endpoint was \n\nabsolute change in PEC score from baseline to 2 hours following Dose 1 for both doses of ADASUVE \n\ncompared with placebo. Among the other endpoints were PEC and Clinical Global Impression \u2013 \n\nImprovement (CGI-I) responders at 2 hours after dose 1, and total number of patients per group who \n\nreceived 1, 2, or 3 doses of study medication with and without rescue medication. Responders were \n\nconsidered patients with a \u226540% decrease from baseline in the total PEC score or patients with CGI-I \n\nscore of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nDecreased agitation was evident 10 minutes after Dose 1, the first assessment time, and at all \n\nsubsequent assessments during the 24 hour evaluation period, for both 4.5 mg and 9.1 mg doses in \n\nboth schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. \n\n \n\nExamination of population subsets (age, race, and gender) did not reveal any differential \n\nresponsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings. \n\n \n\nFor the main results, see the table below. \n\nMain results of the pivotal efficacy studies: comparisons between ADASUVE 4.5 mg, 9.1 mg, \n\nand placebo \n\n \n\nStudy \n\nPatients \n\n004-301 \n\nSchizophrenia \n\n004-302 \n\nBipolar Disorder \n\nTreatment \n\nN \n\nPBO \n\n115 \n\n4.5 mg \n\n116 \n\n9.1 mg \n\n112 \n\nPBO \n\n105 \n\n4.5 mg \n\n104 \n\n9.1 mg \n\n105 \n\nP\nE\n\nC\n \n\nC\nh\n\na\nn\n\ng\ne \n\nBaseline  17.4 17.8 17.6 17.7 17.4 17.3 \n\nChange at 2 hr \n\npost dose \n-5.5 -8.1+ -8.6* -4.9 -8.1* -9.0* \n\nSD 4.9 5.2 4.4 4.8 4.9 4.7 \n\nP\nE\n\nC\n \n\nR\nes\n\np\no\n\nn\nd\n\ner\ns \n\n30 min post dose 27.8% 46.6% 57.1% 23.8% 59.6% 61.9% \n\n2 hr post dose 38.3% 62.9% 69.6% 27.6% 62.5% 73.3% \n\nC\nG\n\nI-\nI \n\nR\nes\n\np\no\n\nn\nd\n\ner\n \n\n% CGI-I \n\nResponders \n35.7% 57.4% 67.0% 27.6% 66.3% 74.3% \n\n#\n D\n\no\nse\n\ns \nN\n\nee\nd\n\ned\n One 46.1% 54.4% 60.9% 26.7% 41.3% 61.5% \n\nTwo 29.6% 30.7% 26.4% 41.0% 44.2% 26.0% \n\nThree 8.7% 8.8% 7.3% 11.4% 5.8% 3.8% \n\nRescue 15.6% 6.1% 5.4% 21.0% 8.6% 8.6% \n\n*= p<0.0001 += p<0.01 \n\nPEC Responders = > 40% change from PEC Baseline;  \n\nCGI-I Responders = Score of 1 (Very Much Improved) or 2 (Much Improved) \n\nPBO = placebo SD=Standard Deviation \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a supportive Phase 2 single dose study enrolling a total of 129 patients with schizophrenia and \n\nschizoaffective disorder the decrease in PEC change after 2 hours was -5.0 for placebo, -6.7 for \n\nADASUVE 4.5 mg, and -8.6 (p<0.001) for ADASUVE 9.1 mg. Rescue medication was administered \n\nin respectively 32.6%, 11.1 % and 14.6 % of patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nADASUVE in the subset of the paediatric population from birth to less than 12 years of age for the \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\ntreatment of schizophrenia and in the subset from birth to less than 10 years of age for the treatment of \n\nbipolar disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nADASUVE in the subset of the paediatric population from 12 to less than 18 years of age for the \n\ntreatment of schizophrenia and in the subset from 10 years to less than 18 years of age in bipolar \n\ndisorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nAdministration of ADASUVE resulted in rapid absorption of loxapine with a median time of \n\nmaximum plasma concentration (Tmax) by 2 minutes. Loxapine exposure in the first 2 hours after \n\nadministration (AUC0-2h, a measure of early exposure that is relevant to the onset of therapeutic effect) \n\nwas 25.6 ng*h/mL for the 4.5 mg dose and 66.7 ng*h/mL for the 9.1 mg dose in healthy subjects.  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of loxapine were determined in subjects on chronic, stable \n\nantipsychotic regimens following repeat administration of ADASUVE every 4 hours for a total of 3 \n\ndoses (either 4.5 mg or 9.1 mg). Mean peak plasma concentrations were similar after the first and third \n\ndose of ADASUVE, indicating minimal accumulation during the 4-hour dosing interval. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nLoxapine is removed rapidly from the plasma and distributed in tissues. Animal studies following oral \n\nadministration suggest an initial preferential distribution in the lungs, brain, spleen, heart and kidney. \n\nLoxapine is 96.6% bound to human plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nLoxapine is metabolised extensively in the liver, with multiple metabolites formed. The main \n\nmetabolic pathways include hydroxylation to form 8-OH-loxapine and 7-OH-loxapine, N-oxidation to \n\nform loxapine N-oxide, and de-methylation to form amoxapine. For ADASUVE, the order of \n\nmetabolites observed in humans (based on systemic exposure) was 8-OH-loxapine >> loxapine N \n\noxide > 7-OH-loxapine > amoxapine, with plasma levels of 8-OH-loxapine similar to the parent \n\ncompound. 8-OH-loxapine is not pharmacologically active at the D2 receptor while the minor \n\nmetabolite, 7-OH-loxapine, has high binding affinity to D2 receptors. \n\n \n\nLoxapine is a substrate for several CYP450 isozymes; in vitro studies demonstrated that 7-OH-\n\nloxapine is formed mainly by CYPs 3A4 and 2D6, 8-OH-loxapine is formed mainly by CYP1A2, \n\namoxapine is formed mainly by CYP3A4, 2C19, and 2C8, and loxapine N-oxide is formed by FMOs. \n\n \n\nThe potential for loxapine and its metabolites (amoxapine, 7-OH-loxapine, 8-OH-loxapine, and \n\nloxapine-N-oxide) to inhibit CYP450 - mediated drug metabolism has been examined in vitro for \n\nCYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No significant inhibition was \n\nobserved. In vitro studies indicate that loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine are not inducers of CYP1A2, 2B6 \n\nor 3A4 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. In addition, in vitro studies indicate that loxapine \n\nand 8-OH loxapine are not inhibitors of UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 2B7 and 2B15. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nLoxapine excretion occurs mainly in the first 24 hours. Metabolites are excreted in the urine in the \n\nform of conjugates and in the faeces unconjugated. The terminal elimination half-life (T\u00bd) ranged \n\nfrom 6 to 8 hours. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe mean plasma loxapine concentrations following administration of ADASUVE were linear over \n\nthe clinical dose range. AUC0-2h, AUCinf, and Cmax increased in a dose-dependent manner. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \n\n \n\nSmokers \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis that compared exposures in smokers versus non-smokers \n\nindicated that smoking, which induces CYP1A2, had a minimal effect on the exposure to ADASUVE. \n\nNo dosage adjustment is recommended based on smoking status. \n\n \n\nIn female smokers exposure (AUCinf) to ADASUVE and its active metabolite 7-OH-loxapine is lower \n\nthan in female non-smokers (84% vs 109% 7-OH-loxapine/Loxapine Ratio), which is probably due to \n\nan increase in loxapine clearance in smokers. \n\n \n\nDemographics \n\n \n\nThere were no important differences in the exposure or disposition of loxapine following \n\nadministration of ADASUVE due to age, gender, race, weight, or body mass index (BMI). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity, except for changes to reproductive tissues \n\nrelated to the extended pharmacology of loxapine. Similar changes, e.g., gynecomastia, are known in \n\nhumans, but only after long-term administration of medicines causing hyperprolactinaemia. \n\n \n\nFemale rats did not mate due to persistent diestrus after oral treatment with loxapine. Embryo/fetal \n\ndevelopmental and perinatal studies have shown indications of developmental delay (reduced weights, \n\ndelayed ossification, hydronephrosis, hydrourether, and/or distended renal pelvis with reduced or \n\nabsent papillae) as well as increased numbers of perinatal and neonatal deaths in offspring of rats \n\ntreated from mid-pregnancy with oral doses below the maximum recommended human dose for \n\nADASUVE on a mg/m2 basis (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach single-dose inhaler contains 10 mg loxapine and delivers 9.1 mg loxapine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed (inhalation powder). \n\n \n\nWhite device with a mouthpiece on one end and a pull-tab protruding from the other end. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nADASUVE is indicated for the rapid control of mild-to-moderate agitation in adult patients with \n\nschizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Patients should receive regular treatment immediately after control \n\nof acute agitation symptoms. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nADASUVE should only be administered in a hospital-setting under the supervision of a healthcare \n\nprofessional. \n\n \n\nShort-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator treatment should be available for treatment of possible \n\nsevere respiratory side-effects (bronchospasm).  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended initial dose of ADASUVE is 9.1 mg. A second dose can be given after 2 hours, if \n\nnecessary. No more than two doses should be administered.  \n\n \n\nA lower dose of 4.5 mg may be given if the 9.1 mg dose was not previously tolerated by the patient or \n\nif the physician decides a lower dose is more appropriate.   \n\n \n\nPatient should be observed during the first hour after each dose for signs and symptoms of \n\nbronchospasm. \n\n \n\n  \n\nElderly \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in patients older than 65 years of age have not been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n\nADASUVE has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No data are available. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in children (less than 18 years of age) have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nInhalation use. The product is packaged in a sealed pouch.  \n\n \n\nWhen needed, the product is removed from the pouch. Once the pull-tab is removed, a green light \n\nturns on, indicating the product is ready for use (Note: the product must be used within 15 minutes of \n\npulling the tab). To deliver the medicinal product, the patient inhales through the mouthpiece with a \n\nsteady deep breath. Upon completion of the inhalation, the patient removes the mouthpiece from \n\nmouth and holds breath briefly. The medicinal product has been delivered when the green light turns \n\noff. The device exterior may become warm during use. This is normal. \n\n \n\nFor complete instructions on how to use ADASUVE see information for the healthcare professional \n\nsection of the package leaflet. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to amoxapine. \n\n \n\nPatients with acute respiratory signs/symptoms (e.g., wheezing) or with active airways disease (such \n\nas patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nCorrect use of ADASUVE inhaler is important for administration of the full dose of loxapine. \n\nHealthcare professionals should ensure the patient will use the inhaler properly. \n\n \n\nADASUVE may have limited effectiveness when patients are on concomitant medicinal products, \n\npredominantly other antipsychotics.  \n\n \n\nBronchospasm \n\n \n\nIn placebo-controlled clinical trials in subjects with asthma or COPD, bronchospasm was very \n\ncommonly observed. When it occurred, it was typically reported within 25 minutes after dosing. \n\nConsequently, patients receiving ADASUVE should be observed as appropriate following dosing. \n\nADASUVE has not been investigated in patients with other forms of lung disease. Should \n\nbronchospasm occur after treatment with ADASUVE, it can be treated with a short-acting beta-agonist \n\nbronchodilator, e.g., salbutamol (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). ADASUVE should not be re-administered \n\nin patients who develop any respiratory signs/symptoms (see section 4.3). \n \n\nHypoventilation \n\n \n\nGiven the primary Central Nervous System (CNS) effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used \n\nwith caution in patients with compromised respiration, such as hypovigilant patients or patients with \n\nCNS-depression due to alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most \n\nantipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n\n \n\nADASUVE has not been studied in elderly patients, including those with dementia-related psychosis. \n\nClinical studies with both atypical and conventional antipsychotic medicinal products have \n\ndemonstrated that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis are at an increased risk of death \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\ncompared to placebo. ADASUVE is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related \n\npsychosis.  \n\n \n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms \n\n \n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (including acute dystonia) are known class effects for antipsychotics. \n\nADASUVE should be used with caution in patients with a known history of extrapyramidal \n\nsymptoms. \n\n \n\nTardive dyskinesia \n\n \n\nIf signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient being treated with loxapine, \n\ndiscontinuation should be considered. These symptoms can temporally worsen or can even arise after \n\ndiscontinuation of treatment. \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) \n\n \n\nClinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence \n\nof autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac \n\ndysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria \n\n(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of \n\nNMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, \n\nADASUVE must be discontinued.  \n\n \n\nHypotension \n\n \n\nMild hypotension was reported in short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in agitated patients \n\nadministered ADASUVE. If vasopressor therapy is required, noradrenaline or phenylephrine is \n\npreferred. Adrenaline should not be used, since beta-adrenoceptor stimulation may worsen \n\nhypotension in the setting of loxapine-induced partial alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\n \n\nNo data are available on the use of ADASUVE in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. \n\nADASUVE is not recommended in patient populations with known cardiovascular disease (history of \n\nmyocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), \n\ncerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \n\nhypovolaemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products). \n\n \n\nQT interval \n\n \n\nClinically relevant QT prolongation does not appear to be associated with single and repeat doses of \n\nADASUVE. Caution should be exercised when ADASUVE is administered in patients with known \n\ncardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other \n\nmedicinal products known to prolong the QT interval. The potential risk of QTc prolongation due to \n\ninteraction with medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval is unknown.  \n\n \n\nSeizures / convulsions \n\n \n\nLoxapine should be used with caution in patients with a history of convulsive disorders since it lowers \n\nthe convulsive threshold. Seizures have been reported in patients receiving oral loxapine at \n\nantipsychotic dose levels, and may occur in epileptic patients even with maintenance of routine \n\nanticonvulsant drug therapy (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nAnticholinergic activity \n\n \n\nBecause of anticholinergic action, ADASUVE should be used cautiously in patients with glaucoma or \n\na tendency to urinary retention, particularly with concomitant administration of anticholinergic-type \n\nantiparkinson medicinal products. \n\n \n\nIntoxication or physical disease (delirium) \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ADASUVE has not been evaluated in patients with agitation due to \n\nintoxication or physical disease (delirium). ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who \n\nare intoxicated or delirious (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of benzodiazepines or other hypnosedatives or respiratory depressants \n\nmay be associated with excessive sedation and respiratory depression or respiratory failure. If \n\nbenzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to loxapine, patients should be monitored for \n\nexcessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension.  \n\n \n\nA study of inhaled loxapine and intramuscular lorazepam 1 mg in combination found no significant \n\neffects on respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, or heart rate compared with either drug \n\nadministered alone. Higher doses of lorazepam have not been studied. The effects of the combination \n\non sedation appeared to be additive. \n\n \n\nPotential for ADASUVE to affect other medicinal products \n\n \n\nLoxapine is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal \n\nproducts that are either metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes or glucuronidated by \n\nhuman uridine 5\u2019-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGTs) .  \n\n \n\nCaution is advised if loxapine is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the seizure \n\nthreshold, e.g. phenothiazines or butyrophenones, clozapine, tricyclics or selective serotonine reuptake \n\ninhibitors (SSRIs), tramadol, mefloquine (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicated that loxapine was not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but does inhibit \n\nP-gp. At therapeutic concentrations, however, it is not expected to inhibit P-gp-mediated transport of \n\nother medicinal products in a clinically significant manner. \n\n \n\nGiven the primary CNS effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used with caution in combination \n\nwith alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most antipsychotics, \n\nhypnotics, opiates, etc. The use of loxapine in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication \n\n(either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products) has not been evaluated. Loxapine may cause \n\nsevere respiratory depression if combined with other CNS-depressants (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ADASUVE \n\n \n\nLoxapine is a substrate for flavin-containing mono-oxygenases (FMOs), and for several CYP450 \n\nisozymes (see section 5.2). Therefore, the risk of metabolic interactions caused by an effect on an \n\nindividual isoform is limited. Caution should be used in patients receiving concomitant treatment with \n\nother medicinal products that are either inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, particularly if the \n\nconcomitant medicinal product is known to inhibit or induce several of the enzymes involved in \n\nloxapine metabolism. Such medicinal products may modify efficacy and safety of ADASUVE in an \n\nirregular manner. Concomitant use of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, \n\npropranolol and refecoxib) should be avoided, if possible. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nAdrenaline \n\n \n\nCo-administration of loxapine and adrenaline may cause worsening of hypotension (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nNew-born infants exposed repeatedly to antipsychotics during the third trimester of pregnancy are at \n\nrisk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in \n\nseverity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, \n\ntremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, monitoring of new-borns \n\nshould be considered. ADASUVE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit \n\njustifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nThe extent of the excretion of loxapine or its metabolites in human milk is not known. However, \n\nloxapine and its metabolites have been shown to be transported into the milk of lactating dogs. \n\nPatients should be advised not to breast feed for a period of 48 hours after receiving loxapine and \n\ndiscard the milk produced in the meantime. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo loxapine specific human data on fertility are available. It is known that in humans, long-term \n\ntreatment with antipsychotics may lead to loss of libido and amenorrhoea. In female rats, reproductive \n\neffects have been observed (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nADASUVE has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Because of the potential for \n\nsedation/somnolence, fatigue, or dizziness, patients should not operate hazardous machines, including \n\nmotor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that loxapine has not affected them adversely (see \n\nsection 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAssessment of adverse reactions from clinical study data is based on two Phase 3 and one Phase 2A \n\nshort-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolling 524 adult patients with agitation \n\nassociated with schizophrenia (including 27 patients with schizoaffective disorder) or bipolar disorder, \n\ntreated with ADASUVE 4.5 mg (265 patients) or ADASUVE 9.1 mg (259 patients). \n\n \n\nIn studies in agitated patients, bronchospasm was reported as an uncommon, but serious adverse \n\nreaction, while in subjects with active airways disease, bronchospasm was commonly reported and \n\noften required treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator. The most commonly reported \n\nadverse reactions during treatment with ADASUVE were dysgeusia, sedation/somnolence and \n\ndizziness (dizziness was more common after placebo treatment than loxapine treatment).  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions listed below are categorized using the following convention: Very common (\u2265 \n\n1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \n\nvery rare (< 1/10,000). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n\nMedDRA system organ classification \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common: sedation/somnolence \n\nCommon: dizziness \n\nUncommon: dystonia, dyskinesia, oculogyration, tremor, akathisia/restlessness \n\nVascular disorders \n\nUncommon: hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nCommon: throat irritation \n\nUncommon: bronchospasm (including shortness of breath) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common: dysgeusia \n\nCommon: dry mouth \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nBronchospasm \n\n \n\nIn short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in patients with agitation associated with \n\nschizophrenia or bipolar disorder without active airways disease, bronchospasm (which includes \n\nreports of wheezing, shortness of breath or cough) was uncommon in patients treated with \n\nADASUVE. However, in placebo-controlled clinical trials in subjects with mild-to-moderate \n\npersistent asthma or moderate-to-severe COPD, adverse reactions of bronchospasm were reported very \n\ncommonly. Most of these events occurred within 25 minutes of dosing, were mild to moderate in \n\nseverity, and could be relieved with an inhaled bronchodilator. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions seen with chronic oral loxapine use \n\n \n\nWith chronic oral administration of loxapine, the reported adverse reactions include sedation and \n\ndrowsiness; extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tremor, akathisia, rigidity, and dystonia); cardiovascular \n\neffects (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, light-headedness, and \n\nsyncope); and anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry eyes, blurred vision, and urinary retention). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V . \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo cases of overdosage of ADASUVE were reported in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nIn the event of accidental overdosage, signs and symptoms will depend on the number of units taken \n\nand individual patient tolerance. As would be expected from the pharmacologic actions of loxapine, \n\nthe clinical findings may range from mild depression of the CNS and cardiovascular systems to \n\nprofound hypotension, respiratory depression, and unconsciousness (see section 4.4). The possibility \n\nof occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms and/or convulsive seizures should be kept in mind. Renal \n\nfailure following oral loxapine overdosage has also been reported.  \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThe treatment of overdosage is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Severe hypotension might be \n\nexpected to respond to the administration of noradrenaline or phenylephrine. Adrenaline should not be \n\nused since its use in a patient with partial adrenergic blockage may further lower the blood pressure \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Severe extrapyramidal reactions should be treated with anticholinergic \n\nantiparkinson medicinal products or diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and anticonvulsant therapy \n\nshould be initiated as indicated. Additional measures include oxygen and intravenous fluids. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptics, antipsychotics; ATC code: N05AH01 \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of loxapine is proposed to be mediated through high affinity antagonism of dopamine D2 \n\nreceptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Loxapine binds with noradrenergic, histaminergic, and \n\ncholinergic receptors, and its interaction with these systems may influence the spectrum of its \n\npharmacological effects. \n\n \n\nChanges in the level of excitability of subcortical inhibitory areas have been observed in several \n\nanimal species, associated with calming effects and suppression of aggressive behaviour. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy  \n\n \n\nIn the two Phase 3 studies patients were enrolled who had acute agitation of at least moderate level (14 \n\nor higher on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Excited Component (PEC) scale (poor \n\nimpulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement). Inclusion in Study 004-301 \n\nrequired a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Inclusion in Study 004-302 required a diagnosis of bipolar \n\ndisorder (current episode manic or mixed). Patients had significant and long-standing psychiatric \n\ndisease (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)), based on \n\nyears since diagnosis and previous hospitalizations. Patients were randomised to placebo, ADASUVE \n\n4.5 mg and ADASUVE 9.1 mg.  \n\n \n\nThe mean age of randomized patients was 43.1 years in Study 004-301 and 40.8 years in Study \n\n004-302: young adults (18-25 years old) were scarcely (7.3%) represented in either trial. Women in \n\nthe schizophrenia trial were scarcely represented (26.5%), and about half of the patients were male \n\n(49.7%) in Study 004-302. About 35% of the patients with schizophrenia were taking concomitant \n\nantipsychotics at the time of dosing while approximately 13% of the patients with bipolar disorder \n\nwere taking these drugs. A majority of the patients in both Phase 3 studies were smokers with about \n\n82% of the patients with schizophrenia and 74% of the patients with bipolar disorder currently \n\nsmoking. \n\n \n\nAfter the first dose, a second dose was administered at least 2 hours later if the agitation had not \n\nsubsided sufficiently. A third dose was administered if needed after at least 4 hours after dose 2. \n\nRescue medication (intramuscular lorazepam) was given if medically required. Primary endpoint was \n\nabsolute change in PEC score from baseline to 2 hours following Dose 1 for both doses of ADASUVE \n\ncompared with placebo. Among the other endpoints were PEC and Clinical Global Impression \u2013 \n\nImprovement (CGI-I) responders at 2 hours after dose 1, and total number of patients per group who \n\nreceived 1, 2, or 3 doses of study medication with and without rescue medication. Responders were \n\nconsidered patients with a \u226540% decrease from baseline in the total PEC score or patients with CGI-I \n\nscore of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nDecreased agitation was evident 10 minutes after Dose 1, the first assessment time, and at all \n\nsubsequent assessments during the 24 hour evaluation period, for both 4.5 mg and 9.1 mg doses in \n\nboth schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. \n\n \n\nExamination of population subsets (age, race, and gender) did not reveal any differential \n\nresponsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings. \n\n \n\nFor the main results, see the table below.Main results of the pivotal efficacy studies: comparisons \n\nbetween ADASUVE 4.5 mg, 9.1 mg, and placebo \n\n \n\nStudy \n\nPatients \n\n004-301 \n\nSchizophrenia \n\n004-302 \n\nBipolar Disorder \n\nTreatment \n\nN \n\nPBO \n\n115 \n\n4.5 mg \n\n116 \n\n9.1 mg \n\n112 \n\nPBO \n\n105 \n\n4.5 mg \n\n104 \n\n9.1 mg \n\n105 \n\nP\nE\n\nC\n \n\nC\nh\n\na\nn\n\ng\ne \n\nBaseline  17.4 17.8 17.6 17.7 17.4 17.3 \n\nChange at 2 hr \n\npost dose \n-5.5 -8.1+ -8.6* -4.9 -8.1* -9.0* \n\nSD 4.9 5.2 4.4 4.8 4.9 4.7 \n\nP\nE\n\nC\n \n\nR\nes\n\np\no\n\nn\nd\n\ner\ns \n\n30 min post dose 27.8% 46.6% 57.1% 23.8% 59.6% 61.9% \n\n2 hr post dose 38.3% 62.9% 69.6% 27.6% 62.5% 73.3% \n\nC\nG\n\nI-\nI \n\nR\nes\n\np\no\n\nn\nd\n\ner\n \n\n% CGI-I \n\nResponders \n35.7% 57.4% 67.0% 27.6% 66.3% 74.3% \n\n#\n D\n\no\nse\n\ns \nN\n\nee\nd\n\ned\n One 46.1% 54.4% 60.9% 26.7% 41.3% 61.5% \n\nTwo 29.6% 30.7% 26.4% 41.0% 44.2% 26.0% \n\nThree 8.7% 8.8% 7.3% 11.4% 5.8% 3.8% \n\nRescue 15.6% 6.1% 5.4% 21.0% 8.6% 8.6% \n\n*= p<0.0001 += p<0.01 \n\nPEC Responders = > 40% change from PEC Baseline;  \n\nCGI-I Responders = Score of 1 (Very Much Improved) or 2 (Much Improved) \n\nPBO = placebo SD=Standard Deviation \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a supportive Phase 2 single dose study enrolling a total of 129 patients with schizophrenia and \n\nschizoaffective disorder the decrease in PEC change after 2 hours was -5.0 for placebo, -6.7 for \n\nADASUVE 4.5 mg, and -8.6 (p<0.001) for ADASUVE 9.1 mg. Rescue medication was administered \n\nin respectively 32.6%, 11.1 % and 14.6 % of patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nADASUVE in the subset of the paediatric population from birth to less than 12 years of age for the \n\ntreatment of schizophrenia and in the subset from birth to less than 10 years of age for the treatment of \n\nbipolar disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nADASUVE in the subset of the paediatric population from 12 to less than 18 years of age for the \n\ntreatment of schizophrenia and in the subset from 10 years to less than 18 years of age in bipolar \n\ndisorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nAdministration of ADASUVE resulted in rapid absorption of loxapine with a median time of \n\nmaximum plasma concentration (Tmax) by 2 minutes. Loxapine exposure in the first 2 hours after \n\nadministration (AUC0-2h, a measure of early exposure that is relevant to the onset of therapeutic effect) \n\nwas 25.6 ng*h/mL for the 4.5 mg dose and 66.7 ng*h/mL for the 9.1 mg dose in healthy subjects.  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of loxapine were determined in subjects on chronic, stable \n\nantipsychotic regimens following repeat administration of ADASUVE every 4 hours for a total of 3 \n\ndoses (either 4.5 mg or 9.1 mg). Mean peak plasma concentrations were similar after the first and third \n\ndose of ADASUVE, indicating minimal accumulation during the 4-hour dosing interval. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nLoxapine is removed rapidly from the plasma and distributed in tissues. Animal studies following oral \n\nadministration suggest an initial preferential distribution in the lungs, brain, spleen, heart and kidney. \n\nLoxapine is 96.6% bound to human plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nLoxapine is metabolised extensively in the liver, with multiple metabolites formed. The main \n\nmetabolic pathways include hydroxylation to form 8-OH-loxapine and 7-OH-loxapine, N-oxidation to \n\nform loxapine N-oxide, and de-methylation to form amoxapine. For ADASUVE, the order of \n\nmetabolites observed in humans (based on systemic exposure) was 8-OH-loxapine >> loxapine N \n\noxide > 7-OH-loxapine > amoxapine, with plasma levels of 8-OH-loxapine similar to the parent \n\ncompound. 8-OH-loxapine is not pharmacologically active at the D2 receptor while the minor \n\nmetabolite, 7-OH-loxapine, has high binding affinity to D2 receptors. \n\n \n\nLoxapine is a substrate for several CYP450 isozymes; in vitro studies demonstrated that 7-OH-\n\nloxapine is formed mainly by CYPs 3A4 and 2D6, 8-OH-loxapine is formed mainly by CYP1A2, \n\namoxapine is formed mainly by CYP3A4, 2C19, and 2C8, and loxapine N-oxide is formed by FMOs. \n\n \n\nThe potential for loxapine and its metabolites (amoxapine, 7-OH-loxapine, 8-OH-loxapine, and \n\nloxapine-N-oxide) to inhibit CYP450 - mediated drug metabolism has been examined in vitro for \n\nCYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No significant inhibition was \n\nobserved. In vitro studies indicate that loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine are not inducers of CYP1A2, 2B6 \n\nor 3A4 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. In addition, in vitro studies indicate that loxapine \n\nand 8-OH loxapine are not inhibitors of UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 2B7 and 2B15. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nLoxapine excretion occurs mainly in the first 24 hours. Metabolites are excreted in the urine in the \n\nform of conjugates and in the faeces unconjugated. The terminal elimination half-life (T\u00bd) ranged \n\nfrom 6 to 8 hours. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nThe mean plasma loxapine concentrations following administration of ADASUVE were linear over \n\nthe clinical dose range. AUC0-2h, AUCinf, and Cmax increased in a dose-dependent manner. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \n\n \n\nSmokers \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis that compared exposures in smokers versus non-smokers \n\nindicated that smoking, which induces CYP1A2, had a minimal effect on the exposure to ADASUVE. \n\nNo dosage adjustment is recommended based on smoking status. \n\n \n\nIn female smokers exposure (AUCinf) to ADASUVE and its active metabolite 7-OH-loxapine is lower \n\nthan in female non-smokers (84% vs 109% 7-OH-loxapine/Loxapine Ratio), which is probably due to \n\nan increase in loxapine clearance in smokers. \n\n \n\nDemographics \n\n \n\nThere were no important differences in the exposure or disposition of loxapine following \n\nadministration of ADASUVE due to age, gender, race, weight, or body mass index (BMI). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity, except for changes to reproductive tissues \n\nrelated to the extended pharmacology of loxapine. Similar changes, e.g., gynecomastia, are known in \n\nhumans, but only after long-term administration of medicines causing hyperprolactinaemia. \n\n \n\nFemale rats did not mate due to persistent diestrus after oral treatment with loxapine. Embryo/fetal \n\ndevelopmental and perinatal studies have shown indications of developmental delay (reduced weights, \n\ndelayed ossification, hydronephrosis, hydrourether, and/or distended renal pelvis with reduced or \n\nabsent papillae) as well as increased numbers of perinatal and neonatal deaths in offspring of rats \n\ntreated from mid-pregnancy with oral doses below the maximum recommended human dose for \n\nADASUVE on a mg/m2 basis (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What ADASUVE is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nADASUVE contains the active substance loxapine, which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nantipsychotics. ADASUVE works by blocking certain chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) such \n\nas dopamine and serotonin thus causing calming effects and relieving aggressive behaviour. \n\n \n\nADASUVE is used to treat acute symptoms of mild-to-moderate agitation that may occur in adult \n\npatients who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These are diseases characterised by symptoms \n\nsuch as: \n\n \n\n\u2022 (Schizophrenia) Hearing, seeing, or sensing things which are not there, suspiciousness, mistaken \nbeliefs, incoherent speech and behaviour and emotional flatness. People with this condition may \n\nalso feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense. \n\n\u2022 (Bipolar disorder) Feeling \u201chigh\u201d, having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep \nthan usual, talking very quickly with racing ideas, and sometimes severe irritability. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use ADASUVE  \n\n \n\nDo not use ADASUVE \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to loxapine or amoxapine; \n\u2022 if you have symptoms of wheezing or shortness of breath; \n\u2022 if you have lung problems like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which your \n\ndoctor may have called \u201cCOPD\u201d). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nYour doctor or nurse will talk to you before you use ADASUVE and determine whether it is \n\nappropriate for you. \n\n \n\n\u2022 ADASUVE may cause narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) and may cause you to wheeze, \ncough, feel chest tightness or have shortness of breath. Typically, this will occur within 25 minutes \n\nof use. \n\n\u2022 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a set of symptoms that can occur if you are taking \nantipsychotic medicines, including ADASUVE. These symptoms can be high fever, rigid muscles, \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nirregular or fast heart rate or pulse. NMS can cause death. Do not use ADASUVE again if NMS \n\noccurs. \n\n\u2022 Antipsychotic medicines like ADASUVE can cause movements that you may not be able to \ncontrol including making faces, sticking out your tongue, smacking or puckering your lips, \n\nblinking rapidly, or moving your legs, arms or fingers rapidly. Treatment with ADASUVE may \n\nhave to be stopped if this occurs. \n\n\u2022 ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who are intoxicated or delirious. \n \n\n \n\nBefore treatment with ADASUVE, tell your doctor or nurse if you: \n\n\u2022 have or had breathing problems like asthma or other chronic lung diseases such as bronchitis or \nemphysema \n\n\u2022 have or had heart problems or stroke \n\u2022 have or had low or high blood pressure \n\u2022 have or had seizures (convulsions) \n\u2022 have or had glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) \n\u2022 have or had urinary retention (incomplete emptying of the bladder) \n\u2022 already used ADASUVE and you developed symptoms of wheezing or shortness of breath \n\u2022 ever had muscle or eye movements you can\u2019t control, lack of coordination, sustained muscle \n\ncontraction, or feeling restless or unable to sit still \n\n\u2022 are an older person with dementia (loss of memory and other mental abilities). \n \n\n \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nADASUVE is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and ADASUVE \n\nTell your doctor if you are using or have recently used or might use any other medicines, including: \n\n\u2022 adrenaline \n\u2022 medicines to treat a breathing problem \n\u2022 medicines that may put you at a risk for seizures (for example, clozapine, tricyclics or SSRIs, \n\ntramadol, mefloquine) \n\n\u2022 medicines to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\u2022 lorazepam or other centrally acting medicines (to treat anxiety, depression, pain, or to help you \n\nsleep) or any other medicines that cause sleepiness \n\n\u2022 recreational (illegal) drugs \n\u2022 medicines like fluvoxamine, propranolol, and enoxacin and other medicines that inhibit a certain \n\nliver enzyme called \u201cCYP450 1A2.\u201d \n\n\u2022 medicines to treat schizophrenia, depression, or pain since you may be more at risk for seizures \nUsing ADASUVE and adrenaline together may cause your blood pressure to drop. \n\n \n\nADASUVE with alcohol \n\nBecause ADASUVE affects the nervous system, alcohol should be avoided when using ADASUVE. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine.

What ADASUVE is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nADASUVE contains the active substance loxapine, which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nantipsychotics. ADASUVE works by blocking certain chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) such \n\nas dopamine and serotonin thus causing calming effects and relieving aggressive behaviour. \n\n \n\nADASUVE is used to treat acute symptoms of mild-to-moderate agitation that may occur in adult \n\npatients who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These are diseases characterised by symptoms \n\nsuch as: \n\n \n\n\u2022 (Schizophrenia) Hearing, seeing, or sensing things which are not there, suspiciousness, mistaken \nbeliefs, incoherent speech and behaviour and emotional flatness. People with this condition may \n\nalso feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense. \n\n\u2022 (Bipolar disorder) Feeling \u201chigh\u201d, having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep \nthan usual, talking very quickly with racing ideas, and sometimes severe irritability. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use ADASUVE  \n\n \n\nDo not use ADASUVE \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to loxapine or amoxapine; \n\u2022 if you have symptoms of wheezing or shortness of breath; \n\u2022 if you have lung problems like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which your \n\ndoctor may have called \u201cCOPD\u201d). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nYour doctor or nurse will talk to you before you use ADASUVE and determine whether it is \n\nappropriate for you. \n\n \n\n\u2022 ADASUVE may cause narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) and may cause you to wheeze, \ncough, feel chest tightness or have shortness of breath. Typically, this will occur within 25 minutes \n\nof use. \n\n\u2022 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a set of symptoms that can occur if you are taking \nantipsychotic medicines, including ADASUVE. These symptoms can be high fever, rigid muscles, \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\nirregular or fast heart rate or pulse. NMS can cause death. Do not use ADASUVE again if NMS \n\noccurs. \n\n\u2022 Antipsychotic medicines like ADASUVE can cause movements that you may not be able to \ncontrol including making faces, sticking out your tongue, smacking or puckering your lips, \n\nblinking rapidly, or moving your legs, arms or fingers rapidly. Treatment with ADASUVE may \n\nhave to be stopped if this occurs. \n\n\u2022 ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who are intoxicated or delirious. \n \n\n \n\nBefore treatment with ADASUVE, tell your doctor or nurse if you: \n\n\u2022 have or had breathing problems like asthma or other chronic lung diseases such as bronchitis or \nemphysema \n\n\u2022 have or had heart problems or stroke \n\u2022 have or had low or high blood pressure \n\u2022 have or had seizures (convulsions) \n\u2022 have or had glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) \n\u2022 have or had urinary retention (incomplete emptying of the bladder) \n\u2022 already used ADASUVE and you developed symptoms of wheezing or shortness of breath \n\u2022 ever had muscle or eye movements you can\u2019t control, lack of coordination, sustained muscle \n\ncontraction, or feeling restless or unable to sit still \n\n\u2022 are an older person with dementia (loss of memory and other mental abilities). \n \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nADASUVE is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and ADASUVE \n\nTell your doctor if you are using or have recently used or might use any other medicines, including: \n\n\u2022 adrenaline \n\u2022 medicines to treat a breathing problem \n\u2022 medicines that may put you at a risk for seizures (for example, clozapine, tricyclics or SSRIs, \n\ntramadol, mefloquine) \n\n\u2022 medicines to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\u2022 lorazepam or other centrally acting medicines (to treat anxiety, depression, pain, or to help you \n\nsleep) or any other medicines that cause sleepiness \n\n\u2022 recreational (illegal) drugs \n\u2022 medicines like fluvoxamine, propranolol, and enoxacin and other medicines that inhibit a certain \n\nliver enzyme called \u201cCYP450 1A2.\u201d \n\n\u2022 medicines to treat schizophrenia, depression, or pain since you may be more at risk for seizures \nUsing ADASUVE and adrenaline together may cause your blood pressure to drop. \n\n \n\nADASUVE with alcohol \n\nBecause ADASUVE affects the nervous system, alcohol should be avoided when using ADASUVE. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. You should not breast-feed for a period of 48 hours \n\nafter receiving ADASUVE and should discard the milk produced in the meantime. \n\n \n\nThe following symptoms may occur in newborn babies of mothers that have repeatedly used \n\nantipsychotic medicines in the last three months of their pregnancy: shaking, muscle stiffness and/or \n\nweakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops \n\nany of these symptoms you may need to contact your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDo not drive or use any tools or machines after using ADASUVE until you know how ADASUVE \n\naffects you since dizziness, sedation, and sleepiness have been reported as a potential side effect of \n\nADASUVE. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use ADASUVE \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\nnurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended initial dose is 9.1 mg.

muscles, 47 irregular or fast heart rate or pulse. nms can cause death. do not use adasuve again if nms occurs. antipsychotic medicines like adasuve can cause movements that you may not be able to control including making faces, sticking out your tongue, smacking or puckering your lips, blinking rapidly, or moving your legs, arms or fingers rapidly. treatment with adasuve may have to be stopped if this occurs. adasuve should be used with caution in patients who are intoxicated or delirious. before treatment with adasuve, tell your doctor or nurse if you: have or had breathing problems like
