See section 4.3.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect\nThe vaccine contains 16 milligrams of sorbitol per dose. See section 4.4.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for suspension for injection\n\nBefore reconstitution, the powder is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline cake and the solvent is \na clear colourless liquid.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nProQuad is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella in \nindividuals from 12 months of age.\n\nProQuad can be administered to individuals from 9 months of age under special circumstances (e.g., \nto conform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high \nprevalence of measles; see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nProQuad should be used in accordance to official recommendations.\n\n Individuals 12 months of age and older\nIndividuals from 12 months of age should receive two doses of ProQuad or a single dose of\nProQuad followed by a second dose of a monovalent varicella vaccine to ensure optimal \nprotection against varicella (see section 5.1). At least one month must elapse between the first \nand second dose of any live viral attenuated vaccine. It is preferred that the second dose be \nadministered within three months following the first dose.\n\n Individuals between 9 and 12 months of age\nImmunogenicity and safety data show that ProQuad can be administered to individuals between \n9 and 12 months of age, under special circumstances (e.g., in accordance with official \nrecommendations or when early protection is considered necessary). In such cases, individuals \nshould receive a second dose of ProQuad, given a minimum of 3 months apart, to ensure\noptimal protection against measles and varicella (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n Individuals less than 9 months of age\nProQuad is not indicated in this subset of the paediatric population. The safety and efficacy of \nProQuad in children under 9 months of age have not been established. \n\nProQuad may be used as the second dose in individuals who have previously received measles, \nmumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine is to be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).\n\nThe preferred injection sites are the anterolateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoid \narea in older children, adolescents, and adults.\n\nThe vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any \ncoagulation disorder. \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product: see section 6.6.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nThe vaccine should under no circumstances be injected intravascularly.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1, including neomycin (see sections 2 and 4.4).\n\nBlood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the \nhaematopoietic and lymphatic system.\n\nCurrent immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids) (see section 4.8). \nProQuad is not contraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral \ncorticosteroids (e.g. for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nSevere humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g., severe combined \nimmunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific \nCD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage in children below 12 months: CD4+ <25%, children between 12-35 \nmonths: CD4+ <20%; children between 36-59 months: CD4+ <15% (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\nIn severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing \nvaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence\nof disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported.\n\nFamily history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the \npotential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.\n\nActive untreated tuberculosis. Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced \nexacerbation of the disease when immunized with live measles virus vaccine. No studies have been \nreported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis.\n\nVaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever >38.5C.\n\nPregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see \nsection 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare \nanaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nAdditionally, live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture. \nPersons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g. hives, \nswelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg \ningestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential \nrisk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.\n\nDue caution should be employed in the administration of ProQuad to persons with individual or \nfamily history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the \ntemperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8).\n\nIndividuals less than 12 months of age who are vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during \nmeasles outbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of \ncirculating antibodies of maternal origin and/or immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2 \nand 5.1).\n\nVaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad as Reye \nsyndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates during wild-type varicella infection.\n\nVaccination with ProQuad may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.\n\nTransmission\nExcretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in \nthe majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence \nto indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated \nindividuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a \ntheoretical possibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nvaccine virus to infants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease \n(see section 4.6).\n\nThere are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders’ Edmonston strain of measles virus \nor the Jeryl Lynn™ strain of mumps virus from vaccine recipients to susceptible contacts.\n\nPost-marketing experience suggests that transmission of varicella vaccine virus (Oka/Merck strain)\nresulting in varicella infection including disseminated disease may rarely occur between vaccine \nrecipients (who develop or do not develop a varicella-like rash) and contacts susceptible to varicella\nincluding healthy as well as high-risk individuals (see section 4.8).\n\nHigh-risk individuals susceptible to varicella include:\n\n• immunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3),\n• pregnant women without documented positive history of varicella (chickenpox) or laboratory \n\nevidence of prior infection,\n• newborn infants of mothers without documented positive history of varicella or laboratory \n\nevidence of prior infection.\n\nVaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with high-risk \nindividuals susceptible to varicella for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. In circumstances where \ncontact with high-risk individuals susceptible to varicella is unavoidable, the potential risk of \ntransmission of the varicella vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of acquiring and \ntransmitting wild-type varicella virus.\n\nThrombocytopenia\nThis vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any \ncoagulation disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these \nindividuals.\n\nIn clinical trials, no cases were reported regarding the development or worsening of thrombocytopenia \nin individuals vaccinated with ProQuad. Cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported in post-\nmarketing experience after primary vaccination with ProQuad. In addition, cases of thrombocytopenia \nhave been reported after primary vaccination or revaccination with measles vaccine; measles, mumps, \nand rubella vaccine; and varicella vaccine. Post-marketing experience with live measles, mumps, and \nrubella vaccine indicates that individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe \nthrombocytopenia following vaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia \nfollowing the first dose of a live measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine may develop thrombocytopenia \nwith repeat doses. Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of \nvaccine are needed. The risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering\nvaccination with ProQuad in such cases (see section 4.8).\n\nFebrile seizures\nIn the 5- to 12-day timeframe after the administration of the first dose of quadrivalent measles, \nmumps, rubella and varicella vaccines in children, an increased risk of febrile seizure was observed \ncompared to concomitant administration of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nOther\nVaccination may be considered in patients with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits \noutweigh the risks (asymptomatic HIV patients, IgG subclass deficiencies, congenital neutropenia, \nchronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiency diseases).\n\nImmunocompromised patients who have no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may \nnot respond as well as immunocompetent patients; therefore, some of these patients may acquire \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nmeasles, mumps, rubella, or varicella in case of contact, despite appropriate vaccine administration. \nThese patients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, rubella, and varicella.\n\nPost-exposure prophylaxis\nNo clinical data are available for ProQuad administered after exposure to measles, mumps, rubella, or \nvaricella. However, post-exposure prophylaxis for varicella and measles has been demonstrated with \nVaricella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles-containing vaccines manufactured by Merck & \nCo., Inc., respectively.\n\nSodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose and is considered to be\nessentially sodium-free.\n\nPotassium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) potassium per dose and is considered to be \nessentially potassium-free.\n\nSorbitol\nThe additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and \ndietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.\n\nInterference with laboratory tests: see section 4.5.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAt least 1 month should elapse between receipt of a live virus vaccine and ProQuad.\n\nVaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nDo not give immunoglobulin (IG) or Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG) concomitantly with \nProQuad.\n\nAdministration of immune globulins concomitantly with ProQuad may interfere with the expected \nimmune response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or plasma \ntransfusions, or administration of immune globulins (IG). However, the appropriate suggested interval \nbetween transfusion or IG administration and vaccination will vary with the type of transfusion or \nindication for, and dose of, IG (e.g. 5 months for VZIG).\n\nAdministration of varicella zoster virus antibody-containing blood products, including VZIG or other \nimmune globulin preparations, within 1 month following a dose of ProQuad may reduce the immune \nresponse to the vaccine and hence reduce its protective efficacy. Therefore, administration of any of \nthese products should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of ProQuad unless considered to be \nessential.\n\nIt has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually \nmay result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to\nbe done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or at least 4 to 6 weeks \nafter immunization with ProQuad.\n\nConcomitant use with other vaccines:\nClinical studies have demonstrated that ProQuad can be given simultaneously (but at separate \ninjection sites) with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine, or with monovalent or combination vaccines \ncomprised of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated \npoliomyelitis, or hepatitis B antigen. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nresponses were unaffected. The safety profiles of the administered vaccines were comparable (see\nsection 4.8).\n\nThere are insufficient data to support the use of ProQuad with any other vaccines.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nPregnant women should not be vaccinated with ProQuad.\n\nStudies have not been conducted with ProQuad in pregnant women. It is not known whether ProQuad \ncan cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproduction capacity.\n\nPregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination. Women who intend to become \npregnant should be advised to delay.\n\nBreast-feeding\nStudies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella \nvaccine may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. In the infants with \nserological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease. There is no evidence that \nvaricella vaccine virus is excreted in breast milk. It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine \nvirus is secreted in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering whether to \nadminister ProQuad to a breast-feeding woman.\n\nFertility\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ProQuad. ProQuad has not been evaluated \nfor potential to impair fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machinery have been performed. ProQuad is \nexpected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\na. Summary of the safety profile\n\nIn 5 clinical trials, ProQuad was administered without concomitant vaccines to 6038 children 12 \nthrough 23 months of age. The children in these studies received either the current refrigerator-stable \nformulation or an earlier formulation of ProQuad. Children in these studies were monitored for six \nweeks post vaccination. The safety profiles were comparable for the two different formulations after a \nsingle dose. The only vaccine-related systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly greater \nrate in individuals who received the earlier formulation of ProQuad compared to individuals who \nreceived the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and Varicella \nVaccine live (Oka/Merck) were fever (≥39.4°C rectal equivalent or abnormal) and measles-like rash. \nBoth fever and measles-like rash usually occurred within 5 to 12 days following the vaccination, were \nof short duration and resolved with no long-term sequelae. Pain/tenderness/soreness at the injection \nsite was reported at a statistically lower rate in individuals who received ProQuad.\n\nThe only vaccine related injection-site adverse reaction that was more frequent among recipients of \nProQuad than among recipients of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and \nrubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Inc. was rash at the injection site.\n\nFollowing ProQuad given alone in 7 clinical trials, the observed rates of fever (≥39.4°C rectal \nequivalent) ranged from 10.1% to 39.4%. In comparison, following ProQuad given concomitantly \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nwith Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine in 3 clinical trials, the observed rates of reported fever \n(≥39.4°C rectal equivalent) ranged from 15.2% to 27.2%. \n\nIn a clinical trial of ProQuad administered concomitantly with Infanrix Hexa, the rates of fever \n(≥38.0°C rectal equivalent) were 69.3% following concomitant administration, 61.1% following \nProQuad alone, and 57.3% following Infanrix Hexa alone; the rates of fever (≥39.4°C rectal \nequivalent) were 22.6% following concomitant administration, 20.5% following ProQuad alone, and \n15.9% following Infanrix Hexa alone.\n\nThe overall safety profile of ProQuad was comparable whether it was administered concomitantly or \nalone.\n\nChildren who received a second dose of ProQuad\nIn eight clinical studies, the overall rates of adverse reactions after a second dose of ProQuad were \ngenerally similar to, or lower than, those seen with the first dose. In three of these studies, the rates of \ninjection-site erythema and swelling were statistically significantly higher after the second dose than \nafter the first dose; however, in the remaining five studies, the rates of each of these reactions were \nsimilar after the first and second dose. The fever rate in all eight studies was lower after the second \ndose than after the first dose.\n\nChildren who received ProQuad intramuscularly\nThe general safety profiles of the IM and SC administration routes were comparable; however, fewer \nsubjects experienced injection-site adverse reactions in the IM group after each dose (see section 5.1 \nfor study description).\n\nChildren who received ProQuad at 4 through 6 years of age after primary immunization with \nVaricella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by \nMerck & Co., Inc.\nThe rates and types of adverse reactions seen in the study group that received ProQuad were generally \nsimilar to those seen in the groups that received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, \nmumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. (see section 5.1 for study \ndescription).\n\nNo specific studies have been conducted in individuals from 2 years of age who had not previously \nreceived measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines.\n\nThe most common adverse events reported with the use of ProQuad were: injection-site reactions \nincluding pain/tenderness/soreness, redness, swelling or bruising; fever (≥39.4°C rectal equivalent); \nirritability; rash (including measles-like rash, varicella-like rash, and injection-site rash); upper \nrespiratory infection; vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nb. Tabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions were reported as vaccine related by the investigator in individuals \nafter a single dose of ProQuad. Several adverse events were solicited in the clinical studies and are \ndesignated with the symbol (‡). Additionally, other adverse events have been reported with post-\nmarketing use of ProQuad and/or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of either the measles, \nmumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., the monovalent component vaccines \nof the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., or Varicella Vaccine \nlive (Oka/Merck).

Description of selected adverse reactions\n\nAseptic meningitis\nCases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. \nAlthough a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has\nbeen shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn™ mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.\n\nComplications associated with varicella\nComplications of varicella from vaccine strain including herpes zoster and disseminated disease such \nas aseptic meningitis and encephalitis have been reported in immunocompromised or \nimmunocompetent individuals.\n\nFebrile seizures\nFebrile seizures have been reported in children receiving ProQuad. Consistent with clinical study data \non the timing of fever and measles-like rash, a post-marketing observational study in children 12 to 60 \nmonths of age revealed an approximate two-fold increase (0.70 per 1000 vs. 0.32 per 1000 children) \nin the risk of febrile seizures in the 5- to 12-day timeframe after a first dose of ProQuad (N=31,298) \ncompared with concomitant administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured \nby Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) (N=31,298).These data suggest \none additional case of febrile seizure per 2600 children vaccinated with ProQuad compared with \nseparate administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., \nInc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). These data were confirmed by a post-marketing \nobservational study sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the 30-day \ntimeframe following vaccination, no increased risk of febrile seizures was observed (see section 5.1).\n\nEncephalitis and encephalopathy\nIn severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing \nvaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence \nof disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported (see section 4.3); disseminated \nmumps and rubella vaccine virus infection has also been reported.\n\nSSPE\nThere is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE. There have been reports of SSPE in \nchildren who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles \nvaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or \npossibly from the measles vaccination. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted \nby the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the overall effect of measles vaccine \nhas been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE. \n\nArthralgia and/or arthritis\nArthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of \ninfection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and gender, being \ngreatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children. Following vaccination in children, \nreactions in joints are generally uncommon (0 to 3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates \nfor arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12 to 20%), and the \nreactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of \nmonths or on rare occasions for years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in \n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nincidence between those seen in children and adult women. Even in older women (35 to 45 years), \nthese reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.\n\nChronic arthritis\nChronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to \npersistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients \ndeveloped chronic joint symptoms.\n\nCases of herpes zoster in clinical studies\nIn a clinical trial, 2 cases of herpes zoster were reported in 2108 healthy subjects 12 through \n23 months of age who were vaccinated with one dose of ProQuad and followed for 1 year. Both cases \nwere unremarkable and no sequelae were reported. \n\nActive surveillance data in children vaccinated with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and \nfollowed for 14 years after vaccination showed no increase in the frequency of herpes zoster \ncompared to children with prior wild-type varicella during the pre-vaccine era. These surveillance \ndata actually suggest that varicella-vaccinated children may have a lower risk of herpes zoster. \nHowever, the long term effect of varicella vaccination on the incidence of herpes zoster is unknown at \npresent. There are no long-term data currently available with ProQuad (see section 5.1).\n\nTransmission\nBased on post-marketing surveillance, the possibility exists that varicella vaccine virus (Oka/Merck\nstrain) may rarely be transmitted to contacts of recipients of ProQuad who develop or do not develop \na varicella-like rash (see section 4.4). \n\nd. Other special populations\n\nImmunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3)\nNecrotizing retinitis has been reported post-marketing in immunocompromised individuals. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine; ATC code: J07BD54.\n\nEfficacy\nFormal studies to evaluate the efficacy of ProQuad have not been performed. However, the efficacy \nof Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by \nMerck & Co., Inc. has been demonstrated in numerous studies. \n\nEfficacy of the measles, mumps, and rubella components of ProQuad was previously established in a \nseries of double-blind controlled field trials with the monovalent vaccines manufactured by Merck & \nCo., Inc., which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy. In these studies seroconversion in\nresponse to vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13\n\ndiseases. ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against measles, mumps, and rubella similar to \nthose observed after vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by \nMerck & Co., Inc.\n\nMore than 518 million doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & \nCo., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2007). Widespread use of a 2-dose vaccination \nschedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has led to a >99% reduction \nin the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases. \n\nIn combined clinical trials of a single dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) in healthy children, \nthe protective efficacy of the vaccine against all severities of varicella disease ranged from 81% to \n100%. In a large case-control study, the vaccine was estimated to be 85% effective against all forms \nof varicella and 97% effective against moderately severe and severe disease. \n\nIn a study comparing 1 dose (N=1114) to 2 doses (N=1102) of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck), \nthe estimated vaccine efficacy against all severities of varicella disease for the 10-year observation \nperiod was 94% for 1 dose and 98% for 2 doses (p<0.001). Over the 10-year observation period, the \ncumulative rate of varicella was 7.5% after 1 dose and 2.2% after 2 doses. Most cases of varicella \nreported in recipients of 1 dose or 2 doses of vaccine were mild.\n\nAntibody responses against varicella virus ≥5 gpELISA Units/mL in the glycoprotein enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay (gpELISA, a highly sensitive assay which is not commercially available) have \nbeen shown to be highly correlated with long-term protection. Clinical studies have shown that \nimmunization with ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against varicella virus ≥5 gpELISA \nUnits/mL similar to those observed after vaccination with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). \n\nImmunogenicity \nImmunogenicity was studied in children 12 through 23 months of age with a negative clinical history \nof measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella who participated in 5 randomized clinical trials. The \nimmunogenicity of the current refrigerator-stable formulation was shown to be similar to the \nimmunogenicity of the earlier formulation of ProQuad six weeks after a single dose of the vaccine.\nThe immunogenicity of a single dose of an earlier formulation of ProQuad was comparable to the \nimmunogenicity of a single dose of its individual component vaccines (Varicella Vaccine live \n(Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.), \ncurrently used in routine vaccination in some countries.\n\nClinical trials involving 6987 subjects who received ProQuad demonstrated detectable immune \nresponses to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in a high proportion of individuals. The presence \nof detectable antibody was assessed by an appropriately sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent \nassay (ELISA) for measles, mumps (wild-type and vaccine-type strains), and rubella, and by gpELISA \nfor varicella. Following a single dose of ProQuad, the vaccine response rates were 97.7% for measles, \n96.3% to 98.8% for mumps, and 98.8% for rubella. While the seroconversion rate for varicella was \nuniformly high (97.9% to 99.8% across all studies), seroconversion has not been shown to correlate \nwell with protection. The vaccine response rate was 90.9% (range 80.8% to 94.5%) for varicella \nbased on a post-vaccination antibody titre ≥5 gpELISA units/mL (an antibody titre that has been \nshown to be highly correlated with long-term protection). These results were similar to the immune \nresponse rates induced by concomitant administration of a single dose of Varicella Vaccine live \n(Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at \nseparate injection sites.\n\nEvaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose\nA clinical study was conducted with ProQuad administered with a 2-dose schedule, the doses being \ngiven 3 months apart in 1,620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose. \nThe safety profile post-dose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for all age cohorts.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nIn the Full Analysis Set (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high \nseroprotection rates of >99% were elicited to mumps, rubella, and varicella post-dose 2, regardless of \nthe age of the vaccinees at the first dose. After 2 doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were \n98.1% when the first dose was given at 11 months, compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given \nat 12 months (non-inferiority study objective met). After two doses, the seroprotection rates against \nmeasles were 94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months, compared to 98.9% when the first \ndose was given at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective not met). \n\nThe seroprotection rates to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella 6 weeks post-dose 1 and 6 weeks \npost-dose 2, for the Full Analysis Set are given in the following table.\n\nValence \n(seropro\ntection \nlevel)\n\nTime \npoint\n\nDose 1 at 9 months / \nDose 2 at 12 months\n\nN = 527\n\nDose 1 at 11 months / \nDose 2 at 14 months\n\nN = 480\n\nDose 1 at 12 months / \nDose 2 at 15 months\n\nN = 466\nSeroprotection rates\n\n[95% CI]\nSeroprotection rates\n\n[95% CI]\nSeroprotection rates\n\n[95% CI]\n\nMeasles \n(titre ≥255 \nmIU/mL)\n\nPost-\ndose 1\n\n72.3% \n[68.2; 76.1]\n\n87.6% \n[84.2; 90.4]\n\n90.6% \n[87.6; 93.1]\n\nPost-\ndose 2\n\n94.6% \n[92.3; 96.4]\n\n98.1% \n[96.4; 99.1]\n\n98.9% \n[97.5; 99.6]\n\nMumps \n(titre ≥10 \nELISA Ab \nunits/mL)\n\nPost-\ndose 1\n\n96.4% \n[94.4; 97.8]\n\n98.7% \n[97.3; 99.5]\n\n98.5% \n[96.9; 99.4]\n\nPost-\ndose 2\n\n99.2% \n[98.0; 99.8]\n\n99.6% \n[98.5; 99.9]\n\n99.3% \n[98.1; 99.9]\n\nRubella\n(titre ≥10 \nIU/mL)\n\nPost-\ndose 1\n\n97.3% \n[95.5; 98.5]\n\n98.7% \n[97.3; 99.5]\n\n97.8% \n[96.0; 98.9]\n\nPost-\ndose 2\n\n99.4% \n[98.3; 99.9]\n\n99.4% \n[98.1; 99.9]\n\n99.6% \n[98.4; 99.9]\n\nVaricella\n(titre \n≥5 gp \nELISA \nunits/mL)\n\nPost-\ndose 1\n\n93.1% \n[90.6; 95.1]\n\n97.0% \n[95.1; 98.4]\n\n96.5% \n[94.4; 98.0]\n\nPost-\ndose 2\n\n100% \n[99.3; 100]\n\n100% \n[99.2; 100]\n\n100% \n[99.2; 100]\n\nThe post-dose 2 geometric mean titres (GMTs) against mumps, rubella, and varicella were \ncomparable across all age categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who \nreceived the first dose at 9 months of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or \n12 months of age.\n\nChildren who received a second dose of ProQuad\nIn 2 clinical trials, 1035 subjects were administered a second dose of ProQuad approximately \n3 months after the first dose. The vaccine response rates were 99.4% for measles, 99.9% for mumps, \n98.3% for rubella, and 99.4% for varicella (≥5 gpELISA Units/mL). The geometric mean titres \n(GMTs) following the second dose of ProQuad increased approximately 2 fold each for measles, \nmumps, and rubella, and approximately 41 fold for varicella (for safety information, see section 4.8).\n\nChildren who received 2 doses of ProQuad intramuscularly or subcutaneously\nIn a clinical trial, 405 children received 2 doses of ProQuad, either by the intramuscular or \nsubcutaneous route of administration. Two doses of ProQuad administered by the IM route of \nadministration were as immunogenic as two doses administered by the SC route in terms of antibody \nresponse rates and antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nChildren who received ProQuad at 4 through 6 years of age after primary vaccination with Varicella \nVaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & \nCo., Inc.\nThe immunogenicity and safety of ProQuad were evaluated in a clinical trial involving 799 subjects 4 \nthrough 6 years of age who had received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, \nmumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at least 1 month prior to study entry. \nFollowing the dose of ProQuad, GMTs for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella were similar to \nthose following a second dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and \nrubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. administered concomitantly at separate injection \nsites. Additionally, GMTs for measles, mumps, and rubella were similar to those following a second \ndose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. given \nconcomitantly with placebo (for safety information, see section 4.8).\n\nPersistence of immune response\nThe persistence of antibody at 1 year after vaccination was evaluated in a subset of 2108 subjects who \nwere involved in 1 clinical trial. The antibody persistence rates 1 year postvaccination in recipients of \na single dose of ProQuad were 98.9% (1722/1741) for measles, 96.7% (1676/1733) for mumps, \n99.6% (1796/1804) for rubella, and 97.5% (1512/1550) for varicella (≥5 gpELISA Units/mL).\n\nExperience with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. \ndemonstrates that antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in most \nindividuals 11 to 13 years after primary vaccination. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects \nwho received 1 dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck), detectable varicella antibodies were \npresent in most individuals tested for up to 10 years postvaccination.\n\nObservational studies of long-term effectiveness of varicella vaccine\nSurveillance data from two U.S. observational effectiveness studies confirmed that widespread \nvaricella vaccination reduces the risk of varicella by approximately 90% and that protection is \nmaintained over at least 15 years both in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. These data also \nsuggest that varicella vaccination may reduce the risk of herpes zoster in vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn the first study, a long-term prospective cohort study, approximately 7,600 children vaccinated in \n1995 with varicella vaccine in their second year of life were actively followed for 14 years in order to \nestimate the occurrence of varicella and herpes zoster. Over the entire follow-up, the incidence of \nvaricella was approximately 10-fold lower among vaccinees than among children of the same age in \nthe pre-vaccine era (estimated vaccine effectiveness over the study period was between 73% and \n90%). Regarding herpes zoster, there were fewer herpes zoster cases among varicella vaccinees \nduring the follow-up period than expected from rates in children of the same age with prior wild-type \nvaricella during the pre-vaccine era (relative risk = 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 - 0.89). Breakthrough varicella \nand zoster cases were usually mild.\n\nIn a second long-term surveillance study, five cross-sectional surveys on varicella incidence, each \nfrom a random sample of approximately 8,000 children and adolescents 5 to 19 years of age, were \nconducted over 15 years, from 1995 (pre-vaccine) through 2009. Results showed a gradual decline of \nvaricella rates by an overall 90% to 95% (approximately 10- to 20-fold) from 1995 to 2009 in all age \ngroups, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated children and adolescents. In addition, a decrease by \napproximately 90% (approximately 10-fold) in varicella hospitalization rates was observed in all age \ngroups.\n\nPost-marketing observational safety surveillance study\nSafety was evaluated in an observational study that included 69,237 children vaccinated with \nProQuad 12 months to 12 years old and 69,237 matched children in a historical comparison group \nwho were vaccinated concomitantly with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by \nMerck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). In addition to assessing the incidence \nof febrile seizures occurring within 30 days after the first dose (see section 4.8), the study also \nassessed the general safety of ProQuad in the 30-day period after the first or second dose. Other than \n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nthe increase in febrile seizure after the first dose, no safety concerns after the first or second dose \nwere identified.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nTraditional non-clinical studies were not performed, but there are no non-clinical concerns considered \nrelevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other sections of the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics (SmPC).\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist.\n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others.\n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What ProQuad is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you receive ProQuad\n3. How to use ProQuad\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store ProQuad\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What ProQuad is and what it is used for\n\nProQuad is a vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (varicella) viruses that \nhave been weakened. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural \ndefences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. The \nantibodies help protect against diseases caused by these viruses.\n\nProQuad is given to help protect your child against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox\n(varicella). The vaccine may be administered to persons from 12 months of age.\n\nProQuad may also be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (to \nconform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high \nprevalence of measles).\n\nAlthough ProQuad contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, rubella, or \nchickenpox (varicella) in healthy people.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive ProQuad\n\nDo not use ProQuad\n If the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella \n\nvaccine or to any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin.\n If the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the \n\nimmune system.\n If the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medications that may weaken the \n\nimmune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy).\n If the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including \n\nAIDS).\n If the person to be vaccinated has a family history of congenital or hereditary \n\nimmunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of this person is demonstrated.\n\n \n\n\n\n42\n\n If the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis.\n If the person to be vaccinated has any illness with fever higher than 38.5°C; however, low-\n\ngrade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.\n If the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 \n\nmonth after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nIf the person to be vaccinated has experienced any of the following, talk to the doctor or pharmacist \nbefore ProQuad is given:\n An allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg.\n A history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits).\n A side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps, and/or rubella-containing vaccines that \n\ninvolved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual.\n An infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) without showing symptoms of HIV \n\ndisease. However, vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see Do not \nuse ProQuad).\n\nIf you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets in your blood, the injection will be \ngiven under the skin.\n\nIn rare circumstances, it is possible to catch chickenpox, including severe chickenpox, from a person \nwho has been vaccinated with ProQuad. This may occur in persons who have not previously been \nvaccinated against chickenpox or had chickenpox, as well as persons who fall into one of the \nfollowing categories:\n Individuals with a lowered resistance to diseases.\n Pregnant women who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated against \n\nchickenpox.\n Newborn infants of mothers who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated \n\nagainst chickenpox.\n\nWhenever possible, individuals who have been vaccinated with ProQuad should attempt to avoid \nclose contact, for up to 6 weeks following the vaccination, with anyone who falls into one of the \ncategories above. Tell your doctor if there is anyone who falls into one of the categories above and is \nexpected to be in close contact with the person being vaccinated.\n\nAs with other vaccines, ProQuad may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. Also, if\nthe person to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella \nvirus but is not yet ill, ProQuad may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.\n\nOther medicines and ProQuad\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other \nmedicines (or other vaccines).\n\nProQuad can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as Prevenar, and/or hepatitis \nA vaccine, or with vaccines containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, or hepatitis B. A different place for the injection will be \nused for each vaccine.\n\nThe doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or \nadministration of immune globulin (IG), or varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG). After\nvaccination with ProQuad, IG or VZIG should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you \notherwise. \n\nIf a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, \nor 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad.\n\n \n\n\n\n43\n\nTell the doctor if the person to be vaccinated has recently received a vaccine or if one is scheduled to \nbe given in the near future. The doctor will determine when ProQuad may be given. \n\nThe use of salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used \nto relieve pain and lower fever) should be avoided for 6 weeks following vaccination with ProQuad.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nProQuad should not be given to pregnant women. Women of child-bearing age should take the \nnecessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination.\n\nPersons who are breast-feeding or who intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will \ndecide if ProQuad should be given.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.\n\nProQuad contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.\n\nProQuad contains potassium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘potassium-free’.\n\nProQuad contains sorbitol\nThe additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and \ndietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.\n\n3. How to use ProQuad\n\nProQuad should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer thigh or of \nthe upper arm.\n\nUsually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young children, whereas for older \nindividuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site.\n\nIf the person to be vaccinated has a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine \nshould be given under the skin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.\n\nProQuad is not to be injected directly into any blood vessel. \n\nProQuad is given by injection as follows: \n Infants between 9 and 12 months of age:\n\nProQuad may be administered from 9 months of age. To ensure optimal protection against \nchickenpox and measles, two doses of ProQuad should be given at least three months apart.\n\n Individuals 12 months of age and older:\nTo ensure optimal protection against chickenpox, two doses of ProQuad should be given at \nleast one month apart.\n\nThe appropriate time and number of injections will be determined by your doctor in accordance with \nofficial recommendations.\n\nReconstitution instructions intended for medical and healthcare professionals are included at \nthe end of the leaflet\n\n \n\n\n\n44\n\nIf you forget to take ProQuad\nYour doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets \nthem.\n\nAllergic reactions (hives) may occur. Some of these reactions may be serious and may include \ndifficulty in breathing or swallowing. If the vaccinated person has an allergic reaction, call your \ndoctor right away.\n\nOther side effects have been reported following administration of ProQuad and some of these were \nserious. These included:\n Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): seizures with a fever.\n Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): bronchiolitis (difficulty breathing with or without \n\ncough); unsteadiness with walking.\n\nThe following other side effects reported with the use of ProQuad were:\n Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): injection site complaints including \n\npain/tenderness/soreness, redness, fever (38.9°C or higher);\n Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): injection site complaints including swelling or \n\nbruising; irritability; rash (including measles-like rash, varicella-like rash, and injection-site \nrash); upper respiratory infection; vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nOther side effects have been reported with the use of at least one of the following: ProQuad, previous \nformulations of monovalent and of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines manufactured \nby Merck & Co., Inc., or Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). These adverse events include: \n Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): cough.\n Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): skin infection; chickenpox (varicella).\n Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): unusual bleeding or \n\nbruising under the skin, swelling of the testicles; tingling of the skin, herpes zoster (shingles); \ninflammation of the brain (encephalitis); inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal \ncord not caused by bacterial infection (aseptic meningitis), severe skin disorders; stroke; \nseizures without a fever; joint pain and/or swelling (which could be transient or chronic); and\ninflammation of the lung (pneumonia/pneumonitis).\n\nThe doctor has a more complete list of side effects for ProQuad and for the vaccine components for \nProQuad (the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and Varicella \nVaccine live (Oka/Merck)).\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf the vaccinated person gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear \npale yellow to light pink liquid.\n\nTo reconstitute the vaccine, use only the solvent supplied, because it is free of preservatives or other \nantiviral substances, which might inactivate the vaccine.\n\nIt is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual to prevent transmission \nof infectious agents from one individual to another.\n\nOne needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.\n\nProQuad must not be mixed in a syringe with other vaccines.\n\nReconstitution instructions\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nmailto:cyprus_info@merck.com\nmailto:medicalinformation.it@merck.com\nmailto:msd.slovenia@merck.com\n\n\n48\n\nWithdraw the entire content of the solvent vial into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe \ninto the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely.\n\nThe reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or\nabnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard \nthe vaccine.\n\nIt is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to \nminimize loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.\n\nDo not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.\n\nWithdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the \nneedle, and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.\n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\nSee also section 3 How to use ProQuad.\n\n \n\n\n\n49\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the User\n\nProQuad\nPowder and solvent for suspension for injection in a pre-filled syringe\n\nMeasles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine (live)\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child is vaccinated because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist.\n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others.\n- If you get any of the side effects talk to your doctor of pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet.

How to store ProQuad\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What ProQuad is and what it is used for\n\nProQuad is a vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (varicella) viruses that \nhave been weakened. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural \ndefences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. The \nantibodies help protect against diseases caused by these viruses.\n\nProQuad is given to help protect your child against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox\n(varicella). The vaccine may be administered to persons from 12 months of age.\n\nProQuad may also be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (to \nconform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high \nprevalence of measles).\n\nAlthough ProQuad contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, rubella, or \nchickenpox (varicella) in healthy people.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive ProQuad\n\nDo not use ProQuad\n If the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella\n\nvaccine or to any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin.\n If the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the \n\nimmune system.\n If the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medications that may weaken the \n\nimmune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy).\n If the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including \n\nAIDS).\n If the person to be vaccinated has a family history of congenital or hereditary \n\nimmunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of this person is demonstrated.\n\n \n\n\n\n50\n\n If the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis.\n If the person to be vaccinated has any illness with fever higher than 38.5°C; however, low-\n\ngrade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.\n If the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 \n\nmonth after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding).\n\nWarnings and precaution\nIf the person to be vaccinated has experienced any of the following, talk to the doctor or pharmacist \nbefore ProQuad is given:\n An allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg.\n A history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits).\n A side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps, and/or rubella-containing vaccines that \n\ninvolved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual.\n An infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) without showing symptoms of HIV \n\ndisease. However, vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see Do not \nuse ProQuad).\n\nIf you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets in your blood, the injection will be\ngiven under the skin.\n\nIn rare circumstances, it is possible to catch chickenpox, including severe chickenpox, from a person \nwho has been vaccinated with ProQuad. This may occur in persons who have not previously been \nvaccinated against chickenpox or had chickenpox, as well as persons who fall into one of the \nfollowing categories:\n Individuals with a lowered resistance to diseases.\n Pregnant women who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated against \n\nchickenpox.\n Newborn infants of mothers who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated \n\nagainst chickenpox.\n\nWhenever possible, individuals who have been vaccinated with ProQuad should attempt to avoid \nclose contact, for up to 6 weeks following the vaccination, with anyone who falls into one of the \ncategories above. Tell your doctor if there is anyone who falls into one of the categories above and is \nexpected to be in close contact with the person being vaccinated.\n\nAs with other vaccines, ProQuad may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. Also, if \nthe person to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella \nvirus but is not yet ill, ProQuad may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.\n\nOther medicines and ProQuad\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other \nmedicines (or other vaccines).\n\nProQuad can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as Prevenar, and/or hepatitis \nA vaccine, or with vaccines containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, or hepatitis B. A different place for the injection will be \nused for each vaccine.\n\nThe doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or\nadministration of immune globulin (IG), or varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG). After \nvaccination with ProQuad, IG or VZIG should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you \notherwise. \n\nIf a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, \nor 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad.\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nTell the doctor if the person to be vaccinated has recently received a vaccine or if one is scheduled to \nbe given in the near future. The doctor will determine when ProQuad may be given. \n\nThe use of salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used \nto relieve pain and lower fever) should be avoided for 6 weeks following vaccination with ProQuad.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nProQuad should not be given to pregnant women. Women of child-bearing age should take the \nnecessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination. \n\nPersons who are breast-feeding or who intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will \ndecide if ProQuad should be given.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.\n\nProQuad contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.\n\nProQuad contains potassium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘potassium-free’.\n\nProQuad contains sorbitol\nThe additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and \ndietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.\n\n3. How to use ProQuad\n\nProQuad should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer thigh or of \nthe upper arm.\n\nUsually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young children, whereas for older \nindividuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site.\n\nIf the person to be vaccinated has a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine \nshould be given under the skin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.\n\nProQuad is not to be injected directly into any blood vessel. \n\nProQuad is given by injection as follows: \n Infants between 9 and 12 months of age:\n\nProQuad may be administered from 9 months of age. To ensure optimal protection against \nchickenpox and measles, two doses of ProQuad should be given at least three months apart.\n\n Individuals 12 months of age and older:\nTo ensure optimal protection against chickenpox, two doses of ProQuad should be given at \nleast one month apart.\n\nThe appropriate time and number of injections will be determined by your doctor in accordance with \nofficial recommendations.\n\nReconstitution instructions intended for medical and healthcare professionals are included at \nthe end of the leaflet\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nIf you forget to take ProQuad\n\nYour doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets \nthem.\n\nAllergic reactions (hives) may occur. Some of these reactions may be serious and may include\ndifficulty in breathing or swallowing. If the vaccinated person has an allergic reaction, call your \ndoctor right away.\n\nOther side effects have been reported following administration of ProQuad and some of these were \nserious. These included:\n Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): seizures with a fever. \n Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): bronchiolitis (difficulty breathing with or without \n\ncough); unsteadiness with walking.\n\nThe following other side effects reported with the use of ProQuad were:\n Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): injection site complaints including \n\npain/tenderness/soreness, redness; fever (38.9°C or higher);\n Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): injection site complaints including swelling or\n\nbruising; irritability; rash (including measles-like rash, varicella-like rash, and injection-site \nrash); upper respiratory infection; vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nOther side effects have been reported with the use of at least one of the following: ProQuad, previous \nformulations of monovalent and of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines manufactured \nby Merck & Co., Inc., or Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). These adverse events include: \n Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): cough.\n Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): skin infection; chickenpox (varicella).\n Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): unusual bleeding or \n\nbruising under the skin, swelling of the testicles; tingling of the skin, herpes zoster (shingles); \ninflammation of the brain (encephalitis); inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal \ncord not caused by bacterial infection (aseptic meningitis), severe skin disorders; stroke; \nseizures without a fever; joint pain and/or swelling (which could be transient or chronic); and \ninflammation of the lung (pneumonia/pneumonitis).\n\nThe doctor has a more complete list of side effects for ProQuad and for the vaccine components for \nProQuad (the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and Varicella \nVaccine live (Oka/Merck)).\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf the vaccinated person gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national \nreporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more \ninformation on the safety of this medicine.\n\n5.

When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear \npale yellow to light pink liquid.\n\nTo reconstitute the vaccine, use only the solvent supplied, because it is free of preservatives or other \nantiviral substances, which might inactivate the vaccine.\n\nIt is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual to prevent transmission \nof infectious agents from one individual to another.\n\nOne needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.\n\nProQuad must not be mixed in a syringe with other vaccines.\n\nReconstitution instructions\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nmailto:cyprus_info@merck.com\nmailto:medicalinformation.it@merck.com\nmailto:msd.slovenia@merck.com\n\n\n56\n\nTo attach the needle, it should be firmly placed on the tip of the syringe and secured by rotating a \nquarter of a turn (90°).\n\nInject the entire content of the solvent syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to \ndissolve completely.\n\nThe reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or \nabnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard\nthe vaccine.\n\nIt is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to \nminimize loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.\n\nDo not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.\n\nWithdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the \nneedle, and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.\n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\nSee also section 3 How to use ProQuad.\n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
