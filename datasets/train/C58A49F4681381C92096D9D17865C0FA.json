QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 400 mg sofosbuvir, 100 mg velpatasvir and 100 mg voxilaprevir. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 111 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nBeige, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet of dimensions 10 mm x 20 mm, debossed with \u201cGSI\u201d on one \nside and \u201c3\u201d on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVosevi is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nVosevi treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of \npatients with HCV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Vosevi is one tablet, taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended durations of treatment applicable to all HCV genotypes are shown in Table 1. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1: Recommended treatment durations for Vosevi for all HCV genotypes \nPatient population Treatment duration \nDAA na\u00efve patients without cirrhosis 8 weeks \n\nDAA na\u00efve patients with compensated cirrhosis \n\n12 weeks \n \n8 weeks may be considered in genotype 3 \ninfected patients (see section 5.1) \n\nDAA experienced patients* without cirrhosis or with \ncompensated cirrhosis 12 weeks \n\nDAA: direct-acting antiviral agent \n \n* In clinical trials the DAA experienced patients had been exposed to combination regimens containing any of the following: \ndaclatasvir, dasabuvir, elbasvir, grazoprevir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir \n(administered with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for less than 12 weeks) \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose of Vosevi is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be instructed \nto take the tablet as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual time.  If it \nis after 18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose of Vosevi at the usual \ntime.  Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose of Vosevi. \n \nPatients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 4 hours of dosing an additional tablet of \nVosevi should be taken.  If vomiting occurs more than 4 hours after dosing, no further dose of Vosevi \nis needed (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Vosevi is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.   \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate \n[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis.  Vosevi \nhas not been studied in patients with ESRD requiring dialysis.  Vosevi can be used in these patients \nwith no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available (see section 4.4, 4.8, \n5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Vosevi is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh-\nTurcotte [CPT] Class A).  Vosevi is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (CPT Class B or C) (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Vosevi in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not yet \nbeen established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablet whole with food (see section 5.2).  Due to the bitter \ntaste, it is recommended that the film-coated tablet is not chewed or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nConcomitant use with medicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and/or strong \ncytochrome P450 (CYP) inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin \nand St. John\u2019s wort) (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use with rosuvastatin or dabigatran etexilate (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use with ethinylestradiol-containing medicinal products such as combined oral \ncontraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSevere bradycardia and heart block \n \nLife-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir \ncontaining regimens are used in combination with amiodarone.  Bradycardia has generally occurred \nwithin hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks \nafter initiating HCV treatment. \n \nAmiodarone should only be used in patients on Vosevi when other alternative anti-arrhythmic \ntreatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. \n \nShould concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary, it is recommended that patients \nundergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after \nwhich outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the \nfirst 2 weeks of treatment. \n \nDue to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried \nout for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated \non Vosevi. \n \nAll patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of \nbradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they \nexperience them. \n \nHCV/HBV co-infection \n \nThere are no data on the use of Vosevi in patients with HCV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection.  \nCases of HBV reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after treatment with \nDAAs.  HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment.  HCV/HBV \nco-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should therefore be monitored and managed \naccording to current clinical guidelines. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate \n[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and ESRD requiring haemodialysis.  Vosevi can be used in these \npatients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available (see \nsections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment of Vosevi is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (CPT Class A).  \nVosevi is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B \nor C) (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nLiver transplant patients \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Vosevi in the treatment of HCV infection in patients who are post-liver \ntransplant have not been assessed.  Treatment with Vosevi, in accordance with the recommended \nposology (see section 4.2), should be guided by an assessment of the potential benefits and risks for \nthe individual patient. \n \nUse with moderate P-gp inducers or moderate CYP inducers \n \nMedicinal products that are moderate P-gp and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, modafinil, \noxcarbazepine or rifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and/or voxilaprevir plasma \nconcentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Vosevi.  Co-administration of such medicinal \nproducts with Vosevi is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nUse with strong OATP1B inhibitors \n \nMedicinal products that are strong OATP1B inhibitors (e.g. ciclosporin) may substantially increase \nvoxilaprevir plasma concentrations, the safety of which has not been established.  Co-administration \nof strong OATP1B inhibitors with Vosevi is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nUse with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens \n \nVosevi has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure when used together with an HIV regimen \ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  \nThe safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Vosevi and a pharmacokinetic enhancer \nhas not been established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration of Vosevi \nwith the fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate given in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease \ninhibitor (e.g. darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal \ndysfunction.  Patients receiving Vosevi concomitantly with \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse \nreactions.  Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of Product Characteristics \nfor recommendations on renal monitoring. \n \nUse in diabetic patients  \n \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV DAA treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic patients initiating \nDAA therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the first 3 months, and their diabetic \nmedication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the diabetic care of the patient \nshould be informed when DAA therapy is initiated. \n \nExcipients \n \nVosevi contains lactose.  Consequently, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs Vosevi contains sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, any interactions that have been identified \nwith these active substances individually may occur with Vosevi. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nPotential for Vosevi to affect other medicinal products \n \nVelpatasvir and voxilaprevir are inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3.  Co-administration of \nVosevi with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters may increase the exposure of \nsuch medicinal products.  Medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of these transporters and for \nwhich elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events are contraindicated (see Table 2). \nDabigatran etexilate (P-gp substrate) and rosuvastatin (OATP1B and BCRP substrate) are \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3 and Table 2).  \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect Vosevi \n \nSofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP.  \nVelpatasvir and voxilaprevir are substrates of drug transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  In vitro, \nslow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir primarily by CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 and of \nvoxilaprevir primarily by CYP3A4 was observed. \n \nMedicinal products that may decrease plasma exposure of Vosevi \nMedicinal products that are strong inducers of P-gp and/or strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or \nCYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John\u2019s wort) \nmay decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and/or voxilaprevir leading to reduced \ntherapeutic effect of Vosevi.  The use of such medicinal products with Vosevi is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3 and Table 2). \n \nMedicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, \nmodafinil, oxcarbazepine or rifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and/or voxilaprevir \nplasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Vosevi.  Co-administration with such \nmedicinal products is not recommended with Vosevi (see section 4.4 and Table 2). \n \nMedicinal products that may increase plasma exposure of Vosevi \nCo-administration with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp or BCRP may increase sofosbuvir, \nvelpatasvir or voxilaprevir plasma concentrations.  Medicinal products that inhibit OATP1B, \nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 may increase plasma concentrations of velpatasvir or voxilaprevir.  \nThe use of strong inhibitors of OATP1B (e.g. ciclosporin) with Vosevi is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4 and Table 2).  Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with Vosevi mediated \nby P-gp, BCRP and CYP inhibitors are not expected.  Vosevi may be co-administered with P-gp, \nBCRP and CYP inhibitors. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \n \nAs liver function may change during treatment with Vosevi, close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. \n \nImpact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such \nas calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to \nclearance of HCV. \n \nPatients treated with ethinylestradiol-containing medicinal products \n \nConcomitant use with ethinylestradiol-containing medicinal products may increase the risk of alanine \naminotransferase (ALT) elevations and is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and Table 2). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nInteractions between Vosevi and other medicinal products \n \nTable 2 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product \ninteractions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio \nwere within \u201c\u2194\u201d, extended above \u201c\u2191\u201d, or extended below \u201c\u2193\u201d the predetermined interaction \nboundaries).  The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, its components (sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and/or voxilaprevir), or \nare predicted medicinal product interactions that may occur with Vosevi.

When administered to lactating rats, voxilaprevir was detected in the plasma of \nnursing pups. \n \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  Therefore, Vosevi should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Vosevi on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir or voxilaprevir on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVosevi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the proportion of patients who permanently discontinued treatment due \nto adverse reactions was 0.1% for patients receiving sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 8 weeks.  \nThere were no patients receiving sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 12 weeks who permanently \ndiscontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the Phase 2 and 3 pivotal clinical studies. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions for Vosevi is based on safety data from clinical studies and \npostmarketing experience. All adverse reactions are presented in Table 3. The adverse reactions are \nlisted below by system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are defined as follows: very common \n(\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1000) \nor very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTable 3: Adverse drug reactions identified with Vosevi \nFrequency Adverse drug reaction \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common headache \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common diarrhoea, nausea \nCommon abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nCommon rash \nUncommon angioedemaa \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nCommon myalgia \nUncommon muscle spasm \nLaboratory investigations: \nCommon total bilirubin increased  \na. Adverse reaction identified through post-marketing surveillance for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir-containing products \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac arrhythmias \nCases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir containing regimens \nare used in combination with amiodarone and/or other medicinal products that lower heart rate (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nSkin disorders \nFrequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nTotal bilirubin \nIn the Phase 3 trials increases in total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x the upper limit of normal \nwere observed in 4% of patients without cirrhosis and 10% of patients with compensated cirrhosis, due \n\n\n\n18 \n\nto inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by voxilaprevir.  Total bilirubin levels decreased after \ncompleting Vosevi treatment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \n \nThe safety of sofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with either ledipasvir or velpatasvir has been \nstudied in 154 patients with ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4062 and Study 4063). In this setting, \nexposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse \nreactions have been observed in preclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of \nadverse events and deaths was not clearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest documented doses of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir were single doses of \n1,200 mg, 500 mg, and 900 mg, respectively.  In healthy volunteer studies with sofosbuvir and \nvelpatasvir, there were no untoward effects observed at these dose levels, and adverse events were \nsimilar in frequency and severity to those reported in the placebo groups.  The most common adverse \nreactions in patients receiving voxilaprevir 900 mg were diarrhoea (34%), nausea (17%) and headache \n(9%). \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with Vosevi.  If overdose occurs the patient must be \nmonitored for evidence of toxicity.  Treatment of overdose with Vosevi consists of general supportive \nmeasures including monitoring of vital signs, as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient.  \nHaemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir, \nGS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%.  Haemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant \nremoval of velpatasvir or voxilaprevir since velpatasvir and voxilaprevir are highly bound to plasma \nproteins. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Direct-acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AP56 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is \nrequired for viral replication.  Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular \nmetabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analogue triphosphate (GS-461203), which \ncan be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator.  In a \nbiochemical assay, GS-461203 inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV \ngenotype 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a.  GS-461203 is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases \nnor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. \n \nVelpatasvir is a pan-genotypic HCV inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5A protein, which is required for \nviral replication. \n \nVoxilaprevir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease.  Voxilaprevir acts as a \nnoncovalent, reversible inhibitor of the NS3/4A protease. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19 \n\n \nAntiviral activity \n \nThe 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir against \nfull-length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5B, NS5A and NS3 protease sequences from the \nlaboratory strains are presented in Table 4.  The EC50 values of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and \nvoxilaprevir against clinical isolates are presented in Table 5. \n \nTable 4: Activity of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir against full-length or chimeric \nlaboratory replicons \nReplicon \ngenotype \n\nSofosbuvir EC50, nMa Velpatasvir EC50, nMa Voxilaprevir EC50, nMa \n\n1a 40 0.014 3.9e \n1b 110 0.016 3.3e \n2a 50 0.005-0.016c 3.7-4.5e \n2b 15b 0.002-0.006c 1.8-6.6f \n3a 50 0.004 6.1f \n4a 40 0.009 2.9e \n4d 33 0.004 3.2e \n5a 15b 0.021-0.054d 1.9f \n6a 14-25b 0.006-0.009 3.0-4.0e \n6e NA 0.130d 0.33f \n6n NA NA 2.9f \nNA: Not available \na.

Site directed mutagenesis of NS5A resistance associated variants \n(RAVs) showed that substitutions conferring a > 100-fold reduction in velpatasvir susceptibility are \nM28G, A92K and Y93H/N/R/W in genotype 1a, A92K in genotype 1b, C92T and Y93H/N in \ngenotype 2b, Y93H in genotype 3, and L31V and P32A/L/Q/R in genotype 6.  No individual RAV \ntested in genotypes 2a, 4a or 5a conferred a > 100-fold reduction in velpatasvir susceptibility. \n \nFor voxilaprevir in genotype 1-6 replicons, resistance-associated substitutions selected in 2 or more \ngenotypes were Q41H, A156V/T/L and D168E/H/Y.  Site directed mutagenesis of known NS3 RAVs \nshowed that substitutions conferring a > 100-fold reduction in voxilaprevir susceptibility are A156V, \nA156T or A156L in genotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a and 4.  No individual RAV tested in genotypes 2b, 5a or \n6a conferred a > 100-fold reduction in voxilaprevir susceptibility. \n \nFor both velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, combinations of RAVs often showed greater reductions in \nsusceptibility than individual RAVs alone. \n \nCross resistance in cell culture \nVoxilaprevir is active in vitro against most of the NS3 RAVs that confer resistance to first generation \nNS3/4A protease inhibitors.  Additionally, velpatasvir is active in vitro against most of the \nNS5A RAVs that confer resistance to ledipasvir and daclatasvir.  Sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and \nvoxilaprevir were fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to other classes of DAAs \nwith different mechanisms of actions, e.g. voxilaprevir was fully active against NS5A and NS5B \nNI RAVs. \n \nIn clinical studies \nStudies in DAA-experienced patients \nOf the 263 NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for \n12 weeks in POLARIS-1 (see Table 10), 7 of 263 (3%) patients (2 with genotype 1, 4 with genotype 3, \nand 1 with genotype 4) did not achieve sustained virologic response (SVR12) and qualified for \nresistance analysis; 6 relapsed and 1 experienced virologic breakthrough with pharmacokinetic data \nconsistent with nonadherence.  The patient with genotype 1a and virologic breakthrough developed the \nNS5A RAVs L31M and Y93H.  One patient with genotype 4d who relapsed developed the NS5A \nRAV Y93H.  No NS3, NS5A, or NS5B nucleoside inhibitor (NI) RAVs emerged in the other \n5 patients who relapsed. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nOf the 182 DAA-experienced patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 12 weeks in \nPOLARIS-4 (see Table 11), 1 of 182 (1%) patients relapsed and qualified for resistance analysis.  \nNo NS3, NS5A, or NS5B NI RAVs emerged in this patient infected with genotype 1a HCV. \n \nStudies in DAA-na\u00efve patients \nIn the POLARIS-2 sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 8-week treatment group (see Table 12), a total \nof 21 of 501 (4%) patients (16 with genotype 1, 2 with genotype 2, 2 with genotype 4, and 1 with \ngenotype 5) qualified for resistance analysis due to relapse.  Of these 21 patients, 1 patient had virus \nwith emergent NS5A RAVs Q30R and L31M at failure.  No NS3 and NS5B NI RAVs emerged in any \nof these 21 patients at failure.  In the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 12-week treatment group, a total of 3 of \n440 (1%) patients (2 with genotype 1, 1 with genotype 4) qualified for resistance analysis due to \nrelapse.  Of these 3 patients, 1 patient (33%) had virus with emergent NS5A RAV Y93N at failure.  \nNo NS3 and NS5B NI RAVs emerged in any of these 3 patients. \n \nIn the POLARIS-3 sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 8-week treatment group (see Table 14), \n2 of 110 (2%) patients (genotype 3) qualified for resistance analysis due to relapse.  No NS3, NS5A, \nor NS5B NI RAVs emerged in either of these patients.

The median time to re-treatment was 414 days (range 198-\n1271). Of the 31 patients enrolled, 74% (23/31) were male, 81% (25/31) were white, 71% (22/31) had \na baseline body mass index < 30 kg/m2, 48% (15/31) had compensated cirrhosis, 58% (18/31) had \npreviously received sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, and 42% (13/31) had previously received \nsofosbuvir and velpatasvir. Most subjects had genotype 1 (61% (19/31) [1a, 48% (15/31); 1b, 13% \n(4/31)]) or genotype 3 (26% (8/31)) HCV infection. The overall SVR12 rate was 100% (31/31).  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nElderly \nClinical studies of Vosevi included 189 patients aged 65 and over (17% of total number of patients in \nthe Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies).  The response rates observed for patients \u2265 65 years of age were \nsimilar to that of patients < 65 years of age, across treatment groups. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment \nof chronic hepatitis C (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir have been \nevaluated in healthy adult subjects and in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nSofosbuvir \nFollowing oral administration of Vosevi, sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak median \nplasma concentration was observed 2 hours post-dose.  Median peak plasma concentration of \nGS-331007 was observed 4 hours post-dose.  Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nHCV-infected patients, mean steady-state AUC0-24 and Cmax for sofosbuvir (n = 1038) were \n1665 ng\u2022hr/mL and 678 ng/mL, respectively; mean steady-state AUC0-24 and Cmax for GS-331007 \n(n = 1593) were 12834 ng\u2022hr/mL and 744 ng/mL, respectively.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 \nand Cmax were similar in healthy adult subjects and patients with HCV infection.   \n \nVelpatasvir \nVelpatasvir median peak concentrations were observed at 4 hours post-dose.  Based on the population \npharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients mean steady-state AUC0-24 and Cmax for velpatasvir \n(n = 1595) were 4041 ng\u2022hr/mL and 311 ng/mL, respectively.  Relative to healthy subjects (n = 137), \nvelpatasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax were 41% lower and 39% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected patients. \n \nVoxilaprevir \nVoxilaprevir median peak concentrations were observed 4 hours post-dose.  Based on the population \npharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients mean steady-state AUC0-24 and Cmax for \nvoxilaprevir (n = 1591) were 2577 ng\u2022hr/mL and 192 ng/mL, respectively.  Relative to healthy \nsubjects (n = 63), voxilaprevir AUC0-24 and Cmax were both 260% higher in HCV-infected patients. \n \nEffects of food \nWhen Vosevi or its components taken together were administered with food, sofosbuvir AUC0-inf and \nCmax were 64% to 144% and 9% to 76% higher, respectively; velpatasvir AUC0-inf and Cmax were 40% \nto 166% and 37% to 187% higher, respectively; and voxilaprevir AUC0-inf and Cmax were 112% to \n435% and 147% to 680% higher, respectively.  GS-331007 AUC0-inf did not change and Cmax was 19% \nto 35% lower when Vosevi or its components together were administered with food. \n \nDistribution \n \nSofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent \nof drug concentration over the range of 1 \u03bcg/mL to 20 \u03bcg/mL.  Protein binding of GS-331007 was \nminimal in human plasma.  After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the \nblood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. \n \nVelpatasvir is > 99% bound to human plasma proteins and binding is independent of drug \nconcentration over the range of 0.09 \u03bcg/mL to 1.8 \u03bcg/mL.  After a single 100 mg dose of \n[14C]-velpatasvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between \n0.5 and 0.7. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nVoxilaprevir is approximately > 99% bound to human plasma proteins.  After a single 100 mg dose of \n[14C]-voxilaprevir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between \n0.5 and 0.8. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside \nanalogue triphosphate GS-461203.  The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis \nof the carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and \nphosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by \nphosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway.  Dephosphorylation results in the \nformation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks \nanti-HCV activity in vitro.  After a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, GS-331007 accounted \nfor approximately > 90% of total systemic exposure. \n \nVelpatasvir is primarily a substrate of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 with slow turnover.  \nFollowing a single dose of 100 mg [14C]-velpatasvir, the majority (> 98%) of radioactivity in plasma \nwas parent drug.  The monohydroxylated and desmethylated velpatasvir were the metabolites \nidentified in human plasma.  Unchanged velpatasvir is the major species present in faeces. \n \nVoxilaprevir is primarily a substrate of CYP3A4 with slow turnover.  Following a single dose of \n100 mg [14C]-voxilaprevir, the majority (approximately 91%) of radioactivity in plasma was parent \ndrug.  The hydrolysed and dehydrogenated voxilaprevir were the major metabolites identified in \nhuman plasma.  Unchanged voxilaprevir is the major species present in faeces. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity \nwas greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, \nand expired air, respectively.  The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 \n(78%) while 3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir.  These data indicate that renal clearance is the major \nelimination pathway for GS-331007.  The median terminal half-lives of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 \nfollowing administration of Vosevi were 0.5 and 29 hours, respectively. \n \nFollowing a single 100 mg oral dose of [14C]-velpatasvir, mean total recovery of the \n[14C]-radioactivity was 95%, consisting of approximately 94% and 0.4% recovered from the faeces \nand urine, respectively.  Unchanged velpatasvir was the major species in faeces accounting for a mean \nof 77% of the administered dose, followed by monohydroxylated velpatasvir (5.9%) and \ndesmethylated velpatasvir (3.0%).  These data indicate that biliary excretion of parent drug was a \nmajor route of elimination for velpatasvir.  The median terminal half-life of velpatasvir following \nadministration of Vosevi was approximately 17 hours. \n \nFollowing a single 100 mg oral dose of [14C]-voxilaprevir, mean total recovery of the \n[14C]-radioactivity was 94%, with all radioactivity measured in the faeces and none in the urine.  \nUnchanged voxilaprevir was the major species in faeces accounting for a mean of 40% of the \nadministered dose.  Voxilaprevir metabolites also identified in faeces included des-\n[methylcyclopropylsulphonamide]-voxilaprevir (22.1%), which is formed intestinally, dehydro-\nvoxilaprevir (7.5%), and two des-[methylcyclopropylsulphonamide]-oxy-voxilaprevir metabolites \n(5.4% and 3.9%).  Biliary excretion of parent drug was the major route of elimination for voxilaprevir.  \nThe median terminal half-life of voxilaprevir following administration of Vosevi was approximately \n33 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nSofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUCs are near dose-proportional over the dose range of 200 mg to \n1200 mg.  Velpatasvir AUC increases in a greater than proportional manner from 5 to 50 mg and in a \n\n\n\n28 \n\nless than proportional manner from 50 to 450 mg, indicating velpatasvir absorption is solubility \nlimited.  Voxilaprevir (studied under fed conditions) AUC increases in a greater than dose-\nproportional manner over the dose range of 100 to 900 mg. \n \nIn vitro potential for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir drug-drug interactions \n \nSofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while \nGS-331007 is not.  Voxilaprevir, and to a lesser extent velpatasvir, are also substrates of OATP1B1 \nand OATP1B3.  In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir primarily by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and \nCYP3A4 and of voxilaprevir primarily by CYP3A4 was observed. \n \nSofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, multidrug resistance-\nassociated protein 2 (MRP2), bile salt export pump (BSEP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and organic cation \ntransporter (OCT) 1 and GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, and multidrug and \ntoxin extrusion protein (MATE) 1.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP \nor uridine glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzymes. \n \nVelpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1, and \nits involvement in drug interactions with these transporters is primarily limited to the process of \nabsorption.  At clinically relevant concentrations, velpatasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic transporters \nBSEP, sodium taurocholate cotransporter protein (NTCP), OATP1A2 or OCT1, renal transporters \nOCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MRP2 or MATE1, or CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes. \n \nVoxilaprevir is an inhibitor of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and its \ninvolvement in drug interactions with these transporters is primarily limited to the process of \nabsorption.  At clinically relevant concentrations, voxilaprevir is not an inhibitor of hepatic \ntransporters OCT1, renal transporters OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 or MATE1, or CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nRace and gender \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to race or gender have been identified for \nsofosbuvir, GS-331007, velpatasvir or voxilaprevir. \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients showed that within the age range \n(18 to 85 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir, \nGS-331007, velpatasvir or voxilaprevir.  In the 13 patients aged 75 to 84 years with available \npharmacokinetic data, mean exposure to voxilaprevir was 93% higher than the mean exposure \nobserved in patients aged 18 to 64 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nA summary of the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the exposures of the \ncomponents of Vosevi compared to subjects with normal renal function, as described in the text \nbelow, are provided in Table 15. \n \nTable 15: Effect of Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment on Exposures (AUC) of SOF, GS -\n 331007, Velpatasvir and Voxilaprevir Compared to Subjects with Normal Renal Function \n HCV-Negative Subjects HCV-Infected \n\nSubjects \nMild RI \n(eGFR \n\n\u226550 and \n<80 mL/m\nin/1.73m2) \n\nModerate RI \n(eGFR \u226530 \n\nand \n<50 mL/min/\n\n1.73m2) \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n\n<30 mL/min/ \n1.73m2) \n\nESRD Requiring \nDialysis \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n\n<30 mL/m\nin/1.73m2) \n\nESRD \nRequiring \nDialysis Dosed 1 \n\nhr Before \nDialysis \n\nDosed 1 \nhr After \nDialysis \n\nSofosbuvir 1.6-fold\u2191 2.1-fold\u2191 2.7-fold\u2191 1.3-fold\u2191 1.6-fold\u2191 ~2-fold\u2191 1.8-fold\u2191 \nGS-331007 1.6-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 5.5-fold\u2191 \u226510-fold\u2191 \u226520-fold\u2191 ~7-fold\u2191 18-fold\u2191 \n\n\n\n29 \n\n HCV-Negative Subjects HCV-Infected \nSubjects \n\nMild RI \n(eGFR \n\n\u226550 and \n<80 mL/m\nin/1.73m2) \n\nModerate RI \n(eGFR \u226530 \n\nand \n<50 mL/min/\n\n1.73m2) \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n\n<30 mL/min/ \n1.73m2) \n\nESRD Requiring \nDialysis \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n\n<30 mL/m\nin/1.73m2) \n\nESRD \nRequiring \nDialysis Dosed 1 \n\nhr Before \nDialysis \n\nDosed 1 \nhr After \nDialysis \n\nVelpatasvir - - 1.5-fold\u2191 - - - 1.4-fold\u2191 \nVoxilaprevir - - 1.7-fold\u2191 - - - - \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir was studied in HCV negative patients with mild (eGFR \u2265 50 and \n< 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR \u2265 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal impairment \n(eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following a single \n400 mg dose of sofosbuvir,relative to patients with normal renal function (eGFR \n> 80 mL/min/1.73 m2).  GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction \ncoefficient of approximately 53%.  Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4-hour \nhaemodialysis removed 18% of administered dose. \n \nIn HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment treated with sofosbuvir 200 mg with ribavirin \n(n=10) or sofosbuvir 400 mg with ribavirin (n=10) for 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 90/400 mg \n(n=18) for 12 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were consistent with that \nobserved in HCV negative patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir were studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV \nnegative patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault).  \nVoxilaprevir is not renally eliminated. \n \nAdditionally, the pharmacokinetics of voxilaprevir were studied with a single dose of 100 mg \nvoxilaprevir in HCV negative patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min by \nCockcroft-Gault).  The pharmacokinetics of voxilaprevir have not been studied in subjects with ESRD \nrequiring dialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, and velpatasvir were studied in HCV-infected \npatients with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with once daily sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400/100 mg for \n12 weeks, and compared to patients without renal impairment in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir Phase 2/3 \ntrials. \n \nAlthough exposures of the fixed-dose combination sofosbuvir, GS-331007, velpatasvir, and \nvoxilaprevir were not directly evaluated in HCV-infected patients with ESRD requiring dialysis after \nadministration of Vosevi, the exposures of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, and velpatasvir are expected to be \nsimilar to those observed after administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400/100 mg in HCV-infected \npatients with ESRD requiring dialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir was studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in \nHCV-infected patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C).  Relative \nto patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher in \npatients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and \n9% higher, respectively.  Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected patients indicated \nthat cirrhosis (CPT Class A) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir were studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV \nnegative patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C).  Velpatasvir \nplasma exposure (AUCinf) was similar in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, severe hepatic \nimpairment, and control subjects with normal hepatic function.  Population pharmacokinetic analysis \nin HCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis (CPT Class A) had no clinically relevant effect on the \nexposure of velpatasvir. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of voxilaprevir were studied with a single dose of 100 mg voxilaprevir in HCV \nnegative patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C).  Relative to \npatients with normal hepatic function, the voxilaprevir AUCinf was 299% and 500% higher in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively.  The unbound fraction of voxilaprevir was \napproximately 2-fold higher in severe hepatic impairment compared with moderate hepatic \nimpairment or normal hepatic function.  Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected \npatients indicated that patients with cirrhosis (CPT Class A) had 73% higher exposure of voxilaprevir \nthan those without cirrhosis (see section 4.2). \n \nBody weight \nBody weight did not have a clinically significant effect on sofosbuvir, velpatasvir or voxilaprevir \nexposure according to a population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of Vosevi in paediatric patients have not been established (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSofosbuvir \n \nSofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assays.  No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat and rabbit developmental \ntoxicity studies with sofosbuvir.  Sofosbuvir had no adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction, or \ndevelopment of the offspring in the rat pre- and post-natal development study. \n \nSofosbuvir was not carcinogenic in the 2-year mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies at GS-331007 \nexposures up to 17 and 10-times higher, respectively than human exposure. \n \nVelpatasvir \n \nVelpatasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nVelpatasvir was not carcinogenic in the 26-week transgenic mouse and 2-year rat carcinogenicity \nstudies at exposures up to 67- and 5-times higher than human exposure, respectively. \n \nVelpatasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility.  No teratogenic effects were observed in the \nmouse and rat developmental toxicity studies with velpatasvir at AUC exposures approximately \n23- and 4-fold higher, respectively, than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.  \nHowever, a possible teratogenic effect was indicated in rabbits where an increase in total visceral \nmalformations was seen in exposed animals at AUC exposures up to 0.5 fold the human exposure at \nrecommended clinical dose.  The human relevance of this finding is not known.  Velpatasvir had no \nadverse effects on behaviour, reproduction, or development of the offspring in the rat pre- and \npost-natal development study at AUC exposures approximately 3-fold higher than the human exposure \nat the recommended clinical dose. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nVoxilaprevir \n \nVoxilaprevir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies for voxilaprevir have not been conducted. \n \nVoxilaprevir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility.  No teratogenic effects were observed in \nthe rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies with voxilaprevir at AUC exposures approximately \n141- and 4-times higher, respectively, than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.  \nVoxilaprevir had no adverse effects on behavior, reproduction, or development of the offspring in the \nrat pre- and post-natal development study at AUC exposures approximately 238-times higher than the \nhuman exposure at the recommended clinical dose. \n \n \n6.

What Vosevi is and what it is used for \n \nVosevi is a medicine that contains the active substances sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir in a \nsingle tablet.  It is given to adults of 18 years and older to treat a chronic (long-term) viral infection of \nthe liver called hepatitis C. \n \nThe active substances in this medicine work together by blocking three different proteins that the \nhepatitis C virus needs to grow and reproduce itself, causing the infection to be eliminated from the \nbody. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vosevi \n \nDo not take Vosevi \n\u2022 If you are allergic to sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n \n\n\uf0e0If this applies to you, do not take Vosevi and tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\n\u2022 If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (a herbal medicine used to treat depression); \n\u2022 carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and \n\nprevent seizures); \n\u2022 rosuvastatin (a medicine used to treat high blood cholesterol or decrease the risk of \n\ncertain cardiovascular events); \n\u2022 dabigatran (a medicine used to prevent blood clots); \n\u2022 ethinylestradiol containing medicines, including many contraceptives. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor if you: \n\u2022 have liver problems other than from hepatitis C, for instance \n\n\u2022 if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor \nmay want to monitor you more closely; \n\n\u2022 if you have had a liver transplant. \n\u2022 are taking treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, since your doctor \n\nmay want to monitor you more closely. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vosevi if: \n\u2022 you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat \n\nirregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor \nmay consider alternative treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Vosevi is \nneeded, you may required additional heart monitoring. \n\n\u2022 you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or \nadjustment of your diabetes medication after starting Vosevi. Some diabetic patients have \nexperienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with \nmedicines like Vosevi. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months, any medicines \nfor heart problems and during treatment you experience: \n\u2022 slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; \n\u2022 shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; \n\u2022 chest pain; \n\u2022 light-headedness; \n\u2022 palpitations; \n\u2022 near fainting or fainting. \n \nBlood tests \nYour doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Vosevi.  This is so that: \n\u2022 Your doctor can decide if you should take Vosevi and for how long; \n\u2022 Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C \n\nvirus. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age.  The use of Vosevi in \nchildren and adolescents has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Vosevi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIf you are not sure talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSome medicines must not be taken with Vosevi.  Taking Vosevi with any of these may stop your \nmedicines from working properly, or make any side effects worse: \n\u2022 rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (a herbal medicine used to treat depression); \n\u2022 carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and prevent \n\nseizures); \n\u2022 rosuvastatin (a medicine used to treat high blood cholesterol or decrease the risk of certain \n\ncardiovascular events); \n\u2022 dabigatran (a medicine used to prevent blood clots); \n\u2022 ethinylestradiol containing medicines, including many contraceptives. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: \n \n\u2022 amiodarone, used to treat irregular heartbeats; \n\u2022 rifapentine (an antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n\u2022 oxcarbazepine (medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); \n\u2022 tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, used \n\nto treat HIV infection; \n\u2022 atazanavir, efavirenz or lopinavir, used to treat HIV infection; \n\u2022 digoxin, used to treat heart conditions; \n\u2022 modafinil, used to treat sleep disorders; \n\u2022 atorvastatin, pravastatin, or other statins, used to treat high cholesterol; \n\u2022 ciclosporin, used to suppress the immune system. \nTaking Vosevi with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side \neffects worse.  Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine \nyou are taking. \n \n\u2022 Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, \n\nheartburn or acid reflux as they can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood.  These \nmedicines include: \n\u2022 antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate).  These should \n\nbe taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Vosevi; \n\u2022 proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and \n\nesomeprazole).  If you need high doses of these medicines your doctor may give you a \ndifferent medicine instead or adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking; \n\n\u2022 H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine).  If you \nneed high doses of these medicines your doctor may give you a different medicine instead \nor adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking. \n\nThese medicines can decrease the amount of Vosevi in your blood.  If you are taking one of these \nmedicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid \nreflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. \n \n\u2022 Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take warfarin or other similar medicines \n\ncalled vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood.  Your doctor may need to increase the \nfrequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. \n\n\u2022 Your liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other \nmedications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may \nneed to closely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after \nstarting Vosevi. \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, are breast-feeding your baby, or are planning to have \na baby ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nVosevi is not recommended during pregnancy.  The effects of Vosevi during pregnancy are not \nknown. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Vosevi.  Some of the active substances of Vosevi may \npass into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVosevi should not affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machinery. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nVosevi contains lactose \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are lactose intolerant or intolerant to other sugars.  Vosevi \n\ncontains lactose monohydrate.  If you are lactose intolerant, or if you have been told that you \nhave an intolerance to other sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n3.

Do not chew, crush or split the tablet as it has a very bitter taste. \n \nKidney problems \nTell your doctor if you have kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since Vosevi has not \nbeen fully tested in patients with severe kidney problems. \n \nLiver problems \nVosevi should not be used if you have moderate or severe liver problems. \n \nIf you are taking an antacid, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after Vosevi. \n \nIf you are sick (vomit) after taking Vosevi it may affect the amount of Vosevi in your blood.

Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Vosevi \nIt is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. \n \nIf you do miss a dose, work out how long it is since you last took your Vosevi: \n\u2022 If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Vosevi, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Then take the next dose at your usual time. \n\u2022 If it is 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Vosevi, wait and take the next dose at \n\nyour usual time.  Do not take a double dose (two doses close together). \n \nDo not stop taking Vosevi \nDo not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to.

"always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. recommended dose the recommended dose is one tablet once a day for 8 or 12 weeks. swallow the tablet whole with food. do not chew, crush or split the tablet as it has a very bitter taste. kidney problems tell your doctor if you have kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since vosevi has not been fully tested in patients with severe kidney problems. liver problems vosevi should not be used if you have moderate or severe liver problems. if you are taking an antacid, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after vosevi. if you are sick (vomit) after taking vosevi it may affect the amount of vosevi in your blood. this may make vosevi work less well. if you are sick (vomit) less than 4 hours after taking vosevi, take another tablet. if you are sick (vomit) more than 4 hours after taking vosevi, you do not need to take another tablet until your next scheduled tablet. if you take more vosevi than you should if you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of vosevi you may be at increased risk of side effects with this medicine (see section 4 possible side effects). contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take vosevi it is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. if you do miss a dose, work out how long it is since you last took your vosevi: if you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take vosevi, you must take the tablet as soon as possible. then take the next dose at your usual time. if it is 18 hours or more after the time you usually take vosevi, wait and take the next dose at your usual time. do not take a double dose (two doses close together). do not stop taking vosevi do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to. it is very important that you complete the full course of treatment to give the medicine the best chance to treat your hepatitis c virus infection. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your
