NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTruvada 200 mg/245 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil \n(equivalent to 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or 136 mg of tenofovir). \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains 96 mg lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nBlue, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet, of dimensions 19 mm x 8.5 mm, debossed on one side with \n\u201cGILEAD\u201d and on the other side with \u201c701\u201d. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of HIV-1 infection: \nTruvada is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults \n(see section 5.1). \n \nTruvada is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adolescents, with NRTI resistance or \ntoxicities precluding the use of first line agents (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): \nTruvada is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce \nthe risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents at high risk (see sections 4.2, \n4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTruvada should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment of HIV in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 35 kg: One \ntablet, once daily. \n \nPrevention of HIV in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 35 kg: One \ntablet, once daily. \n \nSeparate preparations of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are available for treatment of HIV-1 \ninfection if it becomes necessary to discontinue or modify the dose of one of the components of \nTruvada.  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIf a dose of Truvada is missed within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, Truvada should be taken \nas soon as possible and the normal dosing schedule should be resumed.  If a dose of Truvada is missed \nby more than 12 hours and it is almost time for the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken and \nthe usual dosing schedule should be resumed. \n \nIf vomiting occurs within 1 hour of taking Truvada, another tablet should be taken.  If vomiting occurs \nmore than 1 hour after taking Truvada a second dose should not be taken.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly: No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment: Emtricitabine and tenofovir are eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to \nemtricitabine and tenofovir increases in individuals with renal dysfunction (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nAdults with renal impairment: \nTruvada should only be used in individuals with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 80 mL/min if the \npotential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks.  See Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Dosing recommendations in adults with renal impairment \n \n Treatment of HIV-1 infection Pre-exposure prophylaxis \nMild renal impairment  \n(CrCl 50-80 mL/min) \n\nLimited data from clinical studies \nsupport once daily dosing \n(see section 4.4). \n\nLimited data from clinical studies \nsupport once daily dosing in HIV-1 \nuninfected individuals with \nCrCl 60-80 mL/min.  Use is not \nrecommended in HIV-1 uninfected \nindividuals with CrCl < 60 mL/min as \nit has not been studied in this \npopulation (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nModerate renal impairment \n(CrCl 30-49 mL/min) \n\nAdministration every 48 hours is \nrecommended based on modelling \nof single-dose pharmacokinetic \ndata for emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil in non-HIV infected \nsubjects with varying degrees of \nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\nNot recommended for use in this \npopulation. \n\nSevere renal impairment  \n(CrCl < 30 mL/min) and \nhaemodialysis patients \n\nNot recommended because \nappropriate dose reductions cannot \nbe achieved with the combination \ntablet. \n\nNot recommended for use in this \npopulation. \n\n \nPaediatrics with renal impairment: \nNot recommended for use in individuals under the age of 18 years with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of Truvada in children under the age of 12 years have not been established \n(see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral administration.  It is preferable that Truvada is taken with food. \n \nThe film-coated tablet can be disintegrated in approximately 100 mL of water, orange juice or grape \njuice and taken immediately. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nUse for pre-exposure prophylaxis in individuals with unknown or positive HIV-1 status. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTransmission of HIV \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission of HIV by infected individuals should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nPatients with HIV-1 harbouring mutations \n \nTruvada should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R \nmutation (see section 5.1). \n \nOverall HIV-1 infection prevention strategy \n \nTruvada is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1.  The time to onset of \nprotection after commencing Truvada is unknown. \n \nTruvada should only be used for pre-exposure prophylaxis as part of an overall HIV-1 infection \nprevention strategy including the use of other HIV-1 prevention measures (e.g. consistent and correct \ncondom use, knowledge of HIV-1 status, regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections). \n \nRisk of resistance with undetected HIV-1 infection: \nTruvada should only be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 in individuals confirmed to be \nHIV negative (see section 4.3).  Individuals should be re-confirmed to be HIV-negative at frequent \nintervals (e.g. at least every 3 months) using a combined antigen/antibody test while taking Truvada \nfor pre-exposure prophylaxis. \n \nTruvada alone does not constitute a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 and \nHIV-1 resistance mutations have emerged in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are \nonly taking Truvada.  \n \nIf clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (< 1 month) exposures \nto HIV-1 are suspected, use of Truvada should be delayed for at least one month and HIV-1 status \nreconfirmed before starting Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis. \n \nImportance of adherence: \nThe effectiveness of Truvada in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with \nadherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in blood (see section 5.1).  HIV-1 uninfected \nindividuals should be counselled at frequent intervals to strictly adhere to the recommended Truvada \ndaily dosing schedule.   \n \nPatients with hepatitis B or C virus infection \n \nHIV-1 infected patients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  Physicians should refer to \ncurrent HIV treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with \nhepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis in patients with HBV or HCV \ninfection has not been established. \n \nIn case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary \nof Product Characteristics for these medicinal products.  See also under Use with ledipasvir and \nsofosbuvir or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir below. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil is indicated for the treatment of HBV and emtricitabine has shown activity \nagainst HBV in pharmacodynamic studies but the safety and efficacy of Truvada have not been \nspecifically established in patients with chronic HBV infection.  \n \nDiscontinuation of Truvada therapy in patients infected with HBV may be associated with severe \nacute exacerbations of hepatitis.  Patients infected with HBV who discontinue Truvada should be \nclosely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping \ntreatment.  If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.  In patients with \nadvanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since post-treatment \nexacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n \nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Truvada have not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders.  The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir has been studied in patients with hepatic \nimpairment and no dose adjustment is required.  The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine has not been \nstudied in patients with hepatic impairment.  Based on minimal hepatic metabolism and the renal route \nof elimination for emtricitabine, it is unlikely that a dose adjustment would be required for Truvada in \npatients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nHIV-1 infected patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an \nincreased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) \nand should be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver \ndisease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nRenal and bone effects in adults \n \nRenal effects \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion.  Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, \nhypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with \nthe use of tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal monitoring \nPrior to initiating Truvada for the treatment of HIV-1 infection or for use in pre-exposure prophylaxis, \nit is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all individuals. \n \nIn individuals without risk factors for renal disease, it is recommended that renal function (creatinine \nclearance and serum phosphate) is monitored after two to four weeks of use, after three months of use \nand every three to six months thereafter. \n \nIn individuals at risk for renal disease more frequent monitoring of renal function is required. \n \nSee also under Co-administration of other medicinal products below. \n \nRenal management in HIV-1 infected patients \nIf serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dL (0.48 mmol/L) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 mL/min \nin any patient receiving Truvada, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including \nmeasurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, \nproximal tubulopathy).  Consideration should be given to interrupting treatment with Truvada in \n\n\n\n6 \n\npatients with creatinine clearance decreased to < 50 mL/min or decreases in serum phosphate \nto < 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L).  Interrupting treatment with Truvada should also be considered in case \nof progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified. \n \nRenal safety with Truvada has only been studied to a very limited degree in HIV-1 infected patients \nwith impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min).  Dose interval adjustments are \nrecommended for HIV-1 infected patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min (see section 4.2).  \nLimited clinical study data suggest that the prolonged dose interval is not optimal and could result in \nincreased toxicity and possibly inadequate response.  Furthermore, in a small clinical study, a \nsubgroup of patients with creatinine clearance between 50 and 60 mL/min who received tenofovir \ndisoproxil in combination with emtricitabine every 24 hours had a 2-4-fold higher exposure to \ntenofovir and worsening of renal function (see section 5.2).  Therefore, a careful benefit-risk \nassessment is needed when Truvada is used in patients with creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min, and \nrenal function should be closely monitored.  In addition, the clinical response to treatment should be \nclosely monitored in patients receiving Truvada at a prolonged dosing interval.  The use of Truvada is \nnot recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and in \npatients who require haemodialysis since appropriate dose reductions cannot be achieved with the \ncombination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nRenal management in pre-exposure prophylaxis \nTruvada has not been studied in HIV-1 uninfected individuals with creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min \nand is therefore not recommended for use in this population.  If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dL \n(0.48 mmol/L) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 60 mL/min in any individual receiving \nTruvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, \nincluding measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see \nsection 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).  Consideration should be given to interrupting use of Truvada in \nindividuals with creatinine clearance decreased to < 60 mL/min or decreases in serum phosphate \nto < 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L).  Interrupting use of Truvada should also be considered in case of \nprogressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified. \n \nBone effects \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8).  If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation \nshould be obtained. \n \nTreatment of HIV-1 infection \nIn a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil with stavudine in \ncombination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients, small decreases in bone \nmineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups.  Decreases in \nBMD of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip were significantly \ngreater in this group until 96 weeks.  However, there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for \nclinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \ninhibitor.  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are \nat a high risk for fractures. \n \nPre-exposure prophylaxis \nIn clinical studies of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, small decreases in BMD were observed.  In a study \nof 498 men, the mean changes from baseline to week 24 in BMD ranged from -0.4% to -1.0% across \nhip, spine, femoral neck and trochanter in men who received daily Truvada prophylaxis (n = 247) vs. \nplacebo (n = 251).  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nRenal and bone effects in the paediatric population \n \nThere are uncertainties associated with the long-term renal and bone effects of tenofovir disoproxil \nduring the treatment of HIV-1 infection in the paediatric population.  There are no data on the \nlong-term renal and bone effects of Truvada when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis in uninfected \nadolescents (see section 5.1).  Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity after cessation of tenofovir \ndisoproxil for treatment of HIV-1 or after cessation of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis cannot be \nfully ascertained. \n \nA multidisciplinary approach is recommended to weigh the benefit/risk balance of the use of Truvada \nfor the treatment of HIV-1 infection or for pre-exposure prophylaxis, decide the appropriate \nmonitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for \nsupplementation on a case by case basis.  \n \nWhen using Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis individuals should be reassessed at each visit to \nascertain whether they remain at high risk of HIV-1 infection. The risk of HIV-1 infection should be \nbalanced against the potential for renal and bone effects with long-term use of Truvada. \n \nRenal effects \nRenal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in HIV-1 \ninfected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1). \n \nRenal monitoring \nRenal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to initiating \nTruvada for treatment of HIV-1 or for pre-exposure prophylaxis, and should be monitored during use \nas in adults (see above). \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dL (0.96 mmol/L) in any paediatric patient receiving \nTruvada, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood \nglucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). If \nrenal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained \nto consider interruption of Truvada use. Interrupting use of Truvada should also be considered in case \nof progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified. \n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nThe same recommendations apply as in adults (see Co-administration of other medicinal products \nbelow). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe use of Truvada is not recommended in individuals under the age of 18 years with renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2). Truvada should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal \nimpairment and should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during \nTruvada use. \n \nBone effects  \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-\nassociated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown \n(see section 5.1). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are detected or suspected during use of Truvada in any paediatric patient, \nconsultation with an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.  \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nHIV-1 infected patients receiving Truvada or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop \nopportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under \nclose clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated \ndiseases. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n \nUse of Truvada should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product \n(see section 4.5).  If concomitant use with nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal function should be \nmonitored weekly. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and \nwith risk factors for renal dysfunction.  If Truvada is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function \nshould be monitored adequately. \n \nA higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients receiving tenofovir \ndisoproxil in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.  Close monitoring \nof renal function is required in these patients (see section 4.5).  In HIV-1 infected patients with renal \nrisk factors, the co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be \ncarefully evaluated. \n \nTruvada should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \nemtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, or other cytidine analogues, such as \nlamivudine (see section 4.5).  Truvada should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir \ndipivoxil. \n \nUse with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir,  sofosbuvir and velpatasvir or sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and \nvoxilaprevir \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, \nespecially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat). \n \nThe safety of tenofovir disoproxil when co-administered with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a pharmacokinetic enhancer has not \nbeen established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration should be \nconsidered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction.  Patients receiving \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with \ntenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions \nrelated to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine  \nCo-administration is not recommended because it results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to \ndidanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5).  Rarely, \npancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.  Co-administration of tenofovir \ndisoproxil and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in \nCD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) \ndidanosine.  A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested \ncombinations. \n \nTriple nucleoside therapy \n \nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \nstage in HIV-1 infected patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and \nabacavir as well as with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen.  There is close structural \nsimilarity between lamivudine and emtricitabine and similarities in the pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics of these two agents.  Therefore, the same problems may be seen if Truvada is \nadministered with a third nucleoside analogue. \n \nElderly \n \nTruvada has not been studied in individuals over the age of 65 years.  Individuals over the age of \n65 years are more likely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when \nadministering Truvada to older people.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nExcipients \n \nTruvada contains lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nAs Truvada contains emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, any interactions that have been identified \nwith these agents individually may occur with Truvada.  Interaction studies have only been performed \nin adults. \n \nThe steady-state pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir were unaffected when emtricitabine \nand tenofovir disoproxil were administered together versus each medicinal product dosed alone. \n \nIn vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the potential for CYP450 \nmediated interactions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil with other medicinal products \nis low. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nTruvada should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \nemtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide or other cytidine analogues, such as \nlamivudine (see section 4.4).  Truvada should not be administered concomitantly with \nadefovir dipivoxil. \n \nDidanosine: The co-administration of Truvada and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 \nand Table 2). \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products: Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by \nthe kidneys, co-administration of Truvada with medicinal products that reduce renal function or \ncompete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of \nemtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal products. \n \nUse of Truvada should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product.  \nSome examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, \nganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). \n \nOther interactions \n \nInteractions between Truvada or its individual component(s) and other medicinal products are listed in \nTable 2 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d, twice daily as \u201cb.i.d.\u201d \nand once daily as \u201cq.d.\u201d).

Therefore the use of Truvada may be considered during pregnancy, if necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir have been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient \ninformation on the effects of emtricitabine and tenofovir in newborns/infants.  Therefore Truvada \nshould not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nAs a general rule, it is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under \nany circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Truvada are available.  Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects \nof emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, \nindividuals should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with both \nemtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHIV-1 infection: The most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably \nrelated to emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil were nausea (12%) and diarrhoea (7%) in an \nopen-label randomised clinical study in adults (GS-01-934, see section 5.1).  The safety profile of \nemtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in this study was consistent with the previous experience with \nthese agents when each was administered with other antiretroviral agents. \n \nPre-exposure prophylaxis: No new adverse reactions to Truvada were identified from two randomised \nplacebo-controlled studies (iPrEx, Partners PrEP) in which 2,830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received \nTruvada once daily for pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Patients were followed for a median of 71 weeks \nand 87 weeks, respectively.  The most frequent adverse reaction reported in the Truvada group in the \niPrEx study was headache (1%). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with the components of Truvada \nfrom clinical study and post-marketing experience in HIV-1 infected patients are listed in Table 3, \nbelow, by body system organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common \n(\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000). \n \nTable 3: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with the individual components of \nTruvada based on clinical study and post-marketing experience \n \nFrequency Emtricitabine Tenofovir disoproxil  \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: \nCommon: neutropenia  \nUncommon: anaemia2  \nImmune system disorders: \nCommon: allergic reaction  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common:  hypophosphataemia1 \nCommon: hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia  \nUncommon:  hypokalaemia1 \nRare:  lactic acidosis \nPsychiatric disorders: \nCommon: insomnia, abnormal dreams   \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common: headache dizziness \nCommon: dizziness headache \n\n\n\n22 \n\nFrequency Emtricitabine Tenofovir disoproxil  \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: diarrhoea, nausea diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n\nCommon: \n\nelevated amylase including elevated \npancreatic amylase, elevated serum \nlipase, vomiting, abdominal pain, \ndyspepsia  \n\nabdominal pain, abdominal distension, \nflatulence \n\nUncommon:  pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders: \n\nCommon: \n\nelevated serum aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) and/or \nelevated serum alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), \nhyperbilirubinaemia \n\nincreased transaminases \n\nRare:  hepatic steatosis, hepatitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common:  rash \n\nCommon: \n\nvesiculobullous rash,  \npustular rash, maculopapular rash, \nrash, pruritus, urticaria, skin \ndiscolouration (increased \npigmentation)2 \n\n \n\nUncommon: angioedema3  \nRare:  angioedema \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nVery common: elevated creatine kinase  \nUncommon:  rhabdomyolysis1, muscular weakness1 \n\nRare: \n osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain \n\nand infrequently contributing to \nfractures)1,3, myopathy1 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: \n\nUncommon: \n increased creatinine, proteinuria, \n\nproximal renal tubulopathy including \nFanconi syndrome \n\nRare: \n\n renal failure (acute and chronic), acute \ntubular necrosis, nephritis (including \nacute interstitial nephritis)3, \nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common:  asthenia \nCommon: pain, asthenia  \n1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n2 Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine was \nadministered to paediatric patients. \n3 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical \nstudies in adults or paediatric HIV clinical studies for emtricitabine or in randomised controlled clinical studies or the \ntenofovir disoproxil expanded access program for tenofovir disoproxil.  The frequency category was estimated from a \nstatistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to emtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical studies \n(n = 1,563) or tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical studies and the expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nRenal impairment: As Truvada may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is recommended \n(see section 4.4).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir \ndisoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some HIV-1 infected patients, declines in creatinine \nclearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of \nrenal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients \nreceiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete \nrecovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nInteraction with didanosine: Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not \nrecommended as it results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase \nthe risk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5).  Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic \nacidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. \n \nMetabolic parameters: Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during \nantiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections \nmay arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been \nreported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many \nmonths after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis: Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally \nacknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of \nthis is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions related to emtricitabine is based on experience in three paediatric \nstudies (n = 169) where treatment-na\u00efve (n = 123) and treatment-experienced (n = 46) paediatric HIV \ninfected patients aged 4 months to 18 years were treated with emtricitabine in combination with other \nantiretroviral agents.  In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anaemia (9.5%) and skin \ndiscolouration (31.8%) occurred more frequently in clinical trials in paediatric patients than in adults \n(see section 4.8, Tabulated summary of adverse reactions). \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil is based on two randomised trials \n(studies GS-US 104-0321 and GS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to \n< 18 years) who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator \n(n = 91) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1). The adverse \nreactions observed in paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were \nconsistent with those observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected adolescents (aged 12 \nto < 18 years), the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower \nthan those observed in subjects who received placebo. In HIV-1 infected children (aged 2 to 15 years), \nthe BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those \nobserved in subjects who remained on their stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 89 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients with a median age of 7 years (range \n2 to 15 years) were exposed to tenofovir disoproxil for a median of 331 weeks. Eight of the 89 patients \n(9.0%) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory \nfindings clinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy. Seven patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 \nand 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Among them, 3 patients experienced a clinically meaningful decline in \nestimated GFR during therapy which improved after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nOther special populations \n \nIndividuals with renal impairment: Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close \nmonitoring of renal function is recommended in any adults with renal impairment receiving Truvada \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). The use of Truvada is not recommended in individuals under the age of \n18 years with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nHIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients: The adverse reaction profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil in a limited number of HIV-infected patients in study GS-01-934 who were co-infected \nwith HBV (n = 13) or HCV (n = 26) was similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV \nwithout co-infection.  However, as would be expected in this patient population, elevations in AST \nand ALT occurred more frequently than in the general HIV infected population. \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HBV infected patients, clinical and \nlaboratory evidence of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the individual must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and \nstandard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \nUp to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and approximately 10% of the tenofovir dose can be removed by \nhaemodialysis.  It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal \ndialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations.  ATC code: J05AR03 \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of cytidine.  Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to \ntenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate.  Both \nemtricitabine and tenofovir have activity that is specific to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and \nHIV-2) and hepatitis B virus. \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate \nand tenofovir diphosphate, respectively.  In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and \ntenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells.  Emtricitabine triphosphate \nand tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain \ntermination. \n \nBoth emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA \npolymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro  \n \nSynergistic antiviral activity was observed with the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir \nin vitro.  Additive to synergistic effects were observed in combination studies with protease inhibitors, \nand with nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25 \n\nResistance \n \nIn vitro: Resistance has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due to the development \nof the M184V/I mutation with emtricitabine or the K65R mutation with tenofovir.  \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine.  The K65R mutation can also \nbe selected by abacavir or didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these agents plus \nlamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir.  Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in patients with \nHIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutation.  In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase \nhas been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, \nemtricitabine, lamivudine and tenofovir.  HIV-1 expressing three or more thymidine analogue \nassociated mutations (TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation \nshowed reduced susceptibility to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nIn vivo - treatment of HIV-1: In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934) in \nantiretroviral-na\u00efve patients, genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all patients \nwith confirmed HIV RNA > 400 copies/mL at weeks 48, 96 or 144 or at the time of early study drug \ndiscontinuation.  As of week 144: \n \n\u2022 The M184V/I mutation developed in 2/19 (10.5%) isolates analysed from patients in the \n\nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil/efavirenz group and in 10/29 (34.5%) isolates analysed from \nthe lamivudine/zidovudine/efavirenz group (p-value < 0.05, Fisher\u2019s Exact test comparing the \nemtricitabine+tenofovir disoproxil group to the lamivudine/zidovudine group among all \npatients).  \n\n\u2022 No virus analysed contained the K65R or K70E mutation. \n\u2022 Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from \n\n13/19 (68%) patients in the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil/efavirenz group and in virus from \n21/29 (72%) patients in the comparative group. \n\n \nIn vivo -pre-exposure prophylaxis: Plasma samples from 2 clinical studies of HIV-1 uninfected \nsubjects, iPrEx and Partners PrEP, were analysed for 4 HIV-1 variants expressing amino acid \nsubstitutions (i.e. K65R, K70E, M184V, and M184I) that potentially confer resistance to tenofovir or \nemtricitabine.  In the iPrEx clinical study, no HIV-1 variants expressing K65R, K70E, M184V, or \nM184I were detected at the time of seroconversion among subjects who became infected with HIV-1 \nafter enrollment in the study.  In 3 of 10 subjects who had acute HIV infection at study enrollment, \nM184I and M184V mutations were detected in the HIV of 2 of 2 subjects in the Truvada group and 1 \nof 8 subjects in the placebo group. \n \nIn the Partners PrEP clinical study, no HIV-1 variants expressing K65R, K70E, M184V, or M184I \nwere detected at the time of seroconversion among subjects who became infected with HIV-1 during \nthe study.  In 2 of 14 subjects who had acute HIV infection at study enrollment, the K65R mutation \nwas detected in the HIV of 1 of 5 subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg group and the M184V \nmutation (associated with resistance to emtricitabine) was detected in the HIV of 1 of 3 subjects in the \nTruvada group. \n \nClinical data  \n \nTreatment of HIV-1 infection: In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934), \nantiretroviral-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients received either a once daily regimen of \nemtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz (n = 255) or a fixed combination of lamivudine and \nzidovudine administered twice daily and efavirenz once daily (n = 254).  Patients in the emtricitabine \nand tenofovir disoproxil group were given Truvada and efavirenz from week 96 to week 144.  At \nbaseline the randomised groups had similar median plasma HIV-1 RNA (5.02 and \n5.00 log10 copies/mL) and CD4 counts (233 and 241 cells/mm3).  The primary efficacy endpoint for \nthis study was the achievement and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA concentrations \n< 400 copies/mL over 48 weeks.  Secondary efficacy analyses over 144 weeks included the proportion \n\n\n\n26 \n\nof patients with HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 or < 50 copies/mL, and change from baseline in \nCD4 cell count. \n \nThe 48-week primary endpoint data showed that the combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil \nand efavirenz provided superior antiviral efficacy as compared with the fixed combination of \nlamivudine and zidovudine with efavirenz as shown in Table 4.  The 144 week secondary endpoint \ndata are also presented in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: 48- and 144-week efficacy data from study GS-01-934 in which emtricitabine, tenofovir \ndisoproxil and efavirenz were administered to antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients with HIV-1 infection \n \n\n GS-01-934 \nTreatment for 48 weeks \n\nGS-01-934 \nTreatment for 144 weeks \n\n Emtricitabine+ \ntenofovir \n\ndisoproxil+efavirenz \n\nLamivudine+ \nzidovudine+ \n\nefavirenz \n\nEmtricitabine+ \ntenofovir \n\ndisoproxil+efavirenz* \n\nLamivudine+ \nzidovudine+ \n\nefavirenz \nHIV-1 RNA \n< 400 copies/mL (TLOVR) \n\n84% (206/244) 73% (177/243) \n \n\n71% (161/227) 58% (133/229) \n\np-value 0.002** 0.004** \n% difference (95%CI) 11% (4% to 19%) 13% (4% to 22%) \nHIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL (TLOVR) \n\n80% (194/244) 70% (171/243) \n \n\n64% (146/227) 56% (130/231) \n\np-value 0.021** 0.082** \n% difference (95%CI) 9% (2% to 17%) 8% (-1% to 17%) \nMean change from \nbaseline in CD4 cell count \n(cells/mm3) \n\n+190 +158 +312 +271 \n\np-value 0.002a 0.089a \nDifference (95%CI) 32 (9 to 55) 41 (4 to 79) \n* Patients receiving emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz were given Truvada plus efavirenz from week 96 to \n\n144. \n** The p-value based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test stratified for baseline CD4 cell count \nTLOVR = Time to Loss of Virologic Response \na: Van Elteren Test \n \nIn a randomised clinical study (M02-418), 190 antiretroviral-na\u00efve adults were treated once daily with \nemtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir given once or twice \ndaily.  At 48 weeks, 70% and 64% of patients demonstrated HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL with the \nonce and twice daily regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir, respectively.  The mean changes in CD4 cell \ncount from baseline were +185 cells/mm3 and +196 cells/mm3, respectively. \n \nLimited clinical experience in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV suggests that treatment with \nemtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection \nresults in a reduction in HBV DNA (3 log10 reduction or 4 to 5 log10 reduction, respectively) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPre-exposure prophylaxis: The iPrEx study (CO-US-104-0288) evaluated Truvada or placebo in \n2,499 HIV-uninfected men (or transgender women) who have sex with men and who were considered \nat high risk for HIV infection.

Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of tenofovir \ndisoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at week 24. \nHowever, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult data and \ncomparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD \nZ-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, \nrespectively, at baseline. Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -\n0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the \ntenofovir disoproxil and placebo groups, respectively. The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group and one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD \nloss (defined as > 4% loss). Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, \nvirologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either \nreplace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original \nregimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks. At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA \nconcentrations < 400 copies/mL. The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained \n< 400 copies/mL at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group. When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment \ngroup had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/mL at week 48.  \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and \n-0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline. Mean \nchanges at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, \nand -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or \nzidovudine groups, respectively. The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar \nbetween the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group. \nTotal body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine \nor zidovudine treatment group. One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or \nzidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48. BMD \nZ-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who were \ntreated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks. BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and \nweight.  \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis in the paediatric population \nThe efficacy and safety of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis in adolescents who adhere to daily \ndosing is expected to be similar to that in adults at the same level of adherence.  The potential renal \nand bone effects with long-term use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis in adolescents are \nunknown (see section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe bioequivalence of one Truvada film-coated tablet with one emtricitabine 200 mg hard capsule and \none tenofovir disoproxil245 mg film-coated tablet was established following single dose \nadministration to fasting healthy subjects.  Following oral administration of Truvada to healthy \nsubjects, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are rapidly absorbed and tenofovir disoproxil is \nconverted to tenofovir.  Maximum emtricitabine and tenofovir concentrations are observed in serum \nwithin 0.5 to 3.0 h of dosing in the fasted state.  Administration of Truvada with food resulted in a \ndelay of approximately three quarters of an hour in reaching maximum tenofovir concentrations and \nincreases in tenofovir AUC and Cmax of approximately 35% and 15%, respectively, when administered \nwith a high fat or light meal, compared to administration in the fasted state.  In order to optimise the \nabsorption of tenofovir, it is recommended that Truvada should preferably be taken with food. \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous administration the volume of distribution of emtricitabine and tenofovir was \napproximately 1.4  L/kg and 800 mL/kg, respectively.  After oral administration of emtricitabine or \ntenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine and tenofovir are widely distributed throughout the body.  In vitro \nbinding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of concentration over \nthe range of 0.02 to 200 \u00b5g/mL.  In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was \nless than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 \u00b5g/mL. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThere is limited metabolism of emtricitabine.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes \noxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and \nconjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose).  In vitro \nstudies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the CYP450 \nenzymes.  Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of \nthe major human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation.  Also, emtricitabine did not \ninhibit uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation. \n \nElimination \n \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 mL/min.  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately \n10 hours. \n \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \nwith approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous \nadministration.  The apparent clearance of tenofovir averaged approximately 307 mL/min.  Renal \nclearance has been estimated to be approximately 210 mL/min, which is in excess of the glomerular \nfiltration rate.  This indicates that active tubular secretion is an important part of the elimination of \ntenofovir.  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to \n18 hours. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nElderly \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with emtricitabine or tenofovir (administered as \ntenofovir disoproxil) in the elderly (over 65 years of age). \n \nGender \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar in male and female patients. \n \nEthnicity \n \nNo clinically important pharmacokinetic difference due to ethnicity has been identified for \nemtricitabine.  The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) have not been \nspecifically studied in different ethnic groups. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with Truvada in children and adolescents (under \n18 years of age).  Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV-1 infected \nadolescent patients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight \u2265 35 kg and in 23 HIV-1 infected \nchildren aged 2 to < 12 years.  Tenofovir exposure achieved in these paediatric patients receiving oral \ndaily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or 6.5 mg/kg body weight tenofovir disoproxil up to a \nmaximum dose of 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg.  Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with tenofovir \ndisoproxil in children under 2 years.  In general, the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine in infants, \nchildren and adolescents (aged 4 months up to 18 years) are similar to those seen in adults. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) are \nexpected to be similar in HIV-1 infected and uninfected adolescents based on the similar exposures of \nemtricitabine and tenofovir in HIV-1 infected adolescents and adults, and the similar exposures of \nemtricitabine and tenofovir in HIV-1 infected and uninfected adults. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nLimited pharmacokinetic data are available for emtricitabine and tenofovir after co-administration of \nseparate preparations or as Truvada in patients with renal impairment.  Pharmacokinetic parameters \nwere mainly determined following administration of single doses of emtricitabine 200 mg or tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment.  The degree \nof renal impairment was defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal \nfunction when CrCl > 80 mL/min; mild impairment with CrCl = 50-79 mL/min; moderate impairment \nwith CrCl = 30-49 mL/min and severe impairment with CrCl = 10-29 mL/min). \n \nThe mean (%CV) emtricitabine drug exposure increased from 12 (25%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL in subjects with \nnormal renal function, to 20 (6%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, 25 (23%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL and 34 (6%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, in subjects with \nmild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.  The mean (%CV) tenofovir drug exposure \nincreased from 2,185 (12%) ng\u2022h/mL in subjects with normal renal function, to 3,064 (30%) ng\u2022h/mL, \n6,009 (42%) ng\u2022h/mL and 15,985 (45%) ng\u2022h/mL, in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal \nimpairment, respectively. \n \nThe increased dose interval for Truvada in HIV-1 infected patients with moderate renal impairment is \nexpected to result in higher peak plasma concentrations and lower Cmin levels as compared to patients \nwith normal renal function.  In subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, \nbetween dialysis drug exposures substantially increased over 72 hours to 53 (19%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL of \nemtricitabine, and over 48 hours to 42,857 (29%) ng\u2022h/mL of tenofovir. \n \nA small clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics of \ntenofovir disoproxil in combination with emtricitabine in HIV infected patients with renal impairment.  \n\n\n\n32 \n\nA subgroup of patients with baseline creatinine clearance between 50 and 60 mL/min, receiving once \ndaily dosing, had a 2-4-fold increase in tenofovir exposure and worsening renal function. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) in \npaediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied.  No data are available to make dose \nrecommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of Truvada have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in non-HBV infected subjects with \nvarying degrees of hepatic insufficiency.  In general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected \nsubjects were similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected patients. \n \nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV infected subjects with \nvarying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) classification.  \nTenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic impairment \nsuggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects.  The mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax and \nAUC0-\u221e values were 223 (34.8%) ng/mL and 2,050 (50.8%) ng\u2022h/mL, respectively, in normal subjects \ncompared with 289 (46.0%) ng/mL and 2,310 (43.5%) ng\u2022h/mL in subjects with moderate hepatic \nimpairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/mL and 2,740 (44.0%) ng\u2022h/mL in subjects with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEmtricitabine: Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on \nconventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic \npotential and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil: Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on tenofovir disoproxil reveal no \nspecial hazard for humans.  Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure \nlevels greater than or equal to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use \ninclude renal and bone toxicity and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity was \ndiagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced BMD (rats and dogs).  The bone toxicity in young \nadult rats and dogs occurred at exposures \u2265 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone \ntoxicity occurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing \n(\u2265 40-fold the exposure in patients).  Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a \nsubstance-related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in \nBMD. \n \nGenotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results \nin one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat \nhepatocytes.  However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \nextremely high dose in mice.  These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or \nfoetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a \nperiand postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. \n \nCombination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil: Genotoxicity and repeated dose toxicity \nstudies of one month or less with the combination of these two components found no exacerbation of \ntoxicological effects compared to studies with the separate components. \n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n6.

What you need to know before you take Truvada \n3. How to take Truvada \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Truvada \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Truvada is and what it is used for \n \nTruvada contains two active substances, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil.  Both of these \nactive substances are antiretroviral medicines which are used to treat HIV infection.  Emtricitabine is \na nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase \ninhibitor.  However, both are generally known as NRTIs and they work by interfering with the normal \nworking of an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to reproduce itself. \n \n\u2022 Truvada is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults  \n\u2022 It is also used to treat HIV in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least \n\n35 kg, and who have already been treated with other HIV medicines that are no longer effective \nor have caused side effects. \n \n\n\u2212 Truvada should always be used combined with other medicines to treat HIV infection. \n\u2212 Truvada can be administered in place of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil used \n\nseparately at the same doses. \n \n\nPeople who are HIV positive can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is \nlowered by effective antiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid \ninfecting other people. \n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Truvada you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \n\u2022 Truvada is also used to reduce the risk of getting HIV-1 infection in adults, and \n\nadolescents aged 12 years to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg, when taken daily, \ntogether with safer sex practices: \nSee section 2 for a list of precautions to take against HIV infection. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Truvada \n \nDo not take Truvada to treat HIV or to reduce the risk of getting HIV if you are allergic to \nemtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n \n\n\uf0e0 If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nBefore taking Truvada to reduce the risk of getting HIV: \n \nTruvada can only help reduce your risk of getting HIV before you are infected. \n \n\u2022 You must be HIV negative before you start to take Truvada to reduce the risk of getting \n\nHIV.  You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV infection. Do not take \nTruvada to reduce your risk unless you are confirmed to be HIV negative.  People who do have \nHIV must take Truvada in combination with other drugs.  \n\n \n\u2022 Many HIV tests can miss a recent infection.  If you get a flu-like illness, it could mean you \n\nhave recently been infected with HIV. \nThese may be signs of HIV infection: \n\u2022 tiredness \n\u2022 fever \n\u2022 joint or muscle aches \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 night sweats \n\u2022 enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor about any flu-like illness \u2013 either in the month before starting \n\nTruvada, or at any time while taking Truvada. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nWhile taking Truvada to reduce the risk of getting HIV: \n \n\u2022 Take Truvada every day to reduce your risk, not just when you think you have been at risk \n\nof HIV infection.  Do not miss any doses of Truvada, or stop taking it.  Missing doses may \nincrease your risk of getting HIV infection. \n\n \n\u2022 Get tested for HIV regularly. \n \n\u2022 If you think you were infected with HIV, tell your doctor straight away.  They may want to do \n\nmore tests to make sure you are still HIV negative. \n \n\u2022 Just taking Truvada may not stop you getting HIV. \n\no Always practice safer sex.  Use condoms to reduce contact with semen, vaginal fluids, \nor blood. \n\no Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, such as \ntoothbrushes and razor blades. \n\no Do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment.  \no Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea.  These \n\ninfections make it easier for HIV to infect you. \n \nAsk your doctor if you have any more questions about how to prevent getting HIV or spreading HIV \nto other people. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nWhile taking Truvada to treat HIV or to reduce the risk of getting HIV: \n \n\u2022 Truvada may affect your kidneys.  Before and during treatment, your doctor may order blood \n\ntests to measure kidney function.  Tell your doctor if you have had kidney disease, or if tests \nhave shown kidney problems. Truvada should not be given to adolescents with existing kidney \nproblems. If you have kidney problems, your doctor may advise you to stop taking Truvada or, \nif you already have HIV, to take Truvada less frequently.  Truvada is not recommended if you \nhave severe kidney disease or are on dialysis. \n\n \nBone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney \ntubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients \n\ninfected with HIV who also have liver disease (including chronic hepatitis B or C), who are \ntreated with antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  \nIf you have hepatitis B or C, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen \nfor you. \n\n \n\u2022 Know your hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status before starting Truvada.  If you have \n\nHBV, there is a serious risk of liver problems when you stop taking Truvada, whether or not \nyou also have HIV.  It is important not to stop taking Truvada without talking to your doctor: \nsee section 3, Do not stop taking Truvada. \n\n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you are over 65.  Truvada has not been studied in patients over 65 years \n\nof age.  \n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you are intolerant to lactose (see Truvada contains lactose later in this \n\nsection). \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nTruvada is not for use in children under 12 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Truvada \n \nDo not take Truvada if you are already taking other medicines that contain the components of \nTruvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil) or any other antiviral medicines that contain \ntenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nTaking Truvada with other medicines that can damage your kidneys: it is especially important to \ntell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines, including \n\n\u2022 aminoglycosides (for bacterial infection) \n\u2022 amphotericin B (for fungal infection) \n\u2022 foscarnet (for viral infection) \n\u2022 ganciclovir (for viral infection) \n\u2022 pentamidine (for infections) \n\u2022 vancomycin (for bacterial infection) \n\u2022 interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) \n\u2022 cidofovir (for viral infection) \n\u2022 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) \n\n \nIf you are taking another antiviral medicine called a protease inhibitor to treat HIV, your doctor may \norder blood tests to closely monitor your kidney function. \n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir \nor sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nTaking Truvada with other medicines containing didanosine (for treatment of HIV infection): \nTaking Truvada with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of \ndidanosine in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts.  Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and \nlactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes causes death, have been reported \nwhen medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your doctor will \ncarefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines.  Tell your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nTruvada with food and drink \n \n\u2022 Whenever possible, Truvada should be taken with food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a \nbaby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIf you have taken Truvada during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and \nother diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took \nNRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of \nside effects. \n \n\u2022 Do not breast-feed during treatment with Truvada.  This is because the active substances in \n\nthis medicine pass into human breast milk. \n \n\u2022 If you are a woman with HIV it is recommended that you do not breast-feed, to avoid passing \n\nthe virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTruvada can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy while taking Truvada, do not drive and do not use any \ntools or machines. \n \nTruvada contains lactose \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nTruvada contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n3. How to take Truvada \n \n\u2022 Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose of Truvada to treat HIV is: \n \n\u2022 Adults: one tablet each day, where possible, with food. \n \n\u2022 Adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day, \n\nwhenever possible with food.   \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \nThe recommended dose of Truvada to reduce the risk of getting HIV is:  \n \n\u2022 Adults: one tablet each day, whenever possible with food. \n\u2022 Adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day, \n\nwhenever possible with food. \n \n\nIf you have difficulty swallowing, you can use the tip of a spoon to crush the tablet.  Then mix \nthe powder with about 100 mL (half a glass) of water, orange juice or grape juice, and drink \nimmediately. \n\n \n\u2022 Always take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine \n\nis fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not \nchange the dose unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\u2022 If you are being treated for HIV infection your doctor will prescribe Truvada with other \n\nantiretroviral medicines.  Please refer to the patient information leaflets of the other \nantiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those medicines. \n\n \n\u2022 If you are taking Truvada to reduce the risk of getting HIV, take Truvada every day, not just \n\nwhen you think you have been at risk of HIV infection. \n \nAsk your doctor if you have any questions about how to prevent getting HIV or prevent spreading HIV \nto other people. \n \nIf you take more Truvada than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Truvada, contact your doctor or nearest \nemergency department for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what \nyou have taken. \n \nIf you miss a dose \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Truvada. \n \n\u2022 If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take Truvada, take the tablet preferably \n\nwith food as soon as possible.  Then take the next dose at your usual time. \n\u2022 If you notice 12 hours or more after the time you usually take Truvada, forget about the missed \n\ndose.  Wait and take the next dose, preferably with food, at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Truvada, take another tablet.  You do not need to take \nanother tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking Truvada. \n \nDo not stop taking Truvada \n \n\u2022 If you take Truvada for treatment of HIV infection, stopping tablets may reduce the \n\neffectiveness of the anti-HIV therapy recommended by your doctor.  \n \n\n\u2022 If you are taking Truvada to reduce the risk of getting HIV, do not stop taking Truvada or \nmiss any doses. Stopping use of Truvada, or missing doses, may increase your risk of getting \nHIV infection. \n\n \n\uf0e0 Do not stop taking Truvada without contacting your doctor.  \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n\u2022 If you have hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Truvada treatment without \ntalking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after stopping \ntreatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not \nrecommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPossible serious side effects:  \n \n\u2022 Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side \n\neffect.  Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are overweight, and in \npeople with liver disease.  The following may be signs of lactic acidosis: \n\u2022 deep rapid breathing \n\u2022 drowsiness \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting)  \n\u2022 stomach pain \n\n \n\uf0e0 If you think you may have lactic acidosis, get medical help immediately. \n\n \n\u2022 Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak \nimmune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter anti-HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement \nin the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been \npresent with no obvious symptoms.  \n\n \n\u2022 Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur \n\nafter you start taking medicines to treat HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many \nmonths after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms \nsuch as: \n\u2022 muscle weakness \n\u2022 weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body \n\u2022 palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity \n\n \n\uf0e0 If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, get medical help \n\nimmediately. \n \nPossible side effects: \n \nVery common side effects  \n(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 dizziness, headache \n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 feeling weak \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 decreases in phosphate in the blood \n\n\n\n50 \n\n\u2022 increased creatine kinase \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 pain, stomach pain \n\u2022 difficulty sleeping, abnormal dreams \n\u2022 problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals, feeling bloated, flatulence \n\u2022 rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), \n\nwhich may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin \nin patches \n\n\u2022 other allergic reactions, such as wheezing, swelling or feeling light-headed \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to \n\ninfection) \n\u2022 increased triglycerides (fatty acids), bile or sugar in the blood \n\u2022 liver and pancreas problems \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n\u2022 anaemia (low red blood cell count) \n\u2022 breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness which may occur due to damage to the kidney \n\ntubule cells \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 decreases in potassium in the blood \n\u2022 increased creatinine in your blood \n\u2022 changes to your urine \n \nRare side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\u2022 Lactic acidosis (see Possible serious side effects) \n\u2022 fatty liver \n\u2022 yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of \n\nthe liver \n\u2022 inflammation of the kidney, passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty, kidney failure, damage to \n\nkidney tubule cells \n\u2022 softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) \n\u2022 back pain caused by kidney problems \n \nDamage to kidney tubule cells may be associated with breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones \n(with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in \npotassium or phosphate in the blood. \n \n\uf0e0 If you notice any of the side effects listed above or if any of the side effects get serious, talk \n\nto your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known.  \n\u2022 Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Truvada \n\nmay develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \nsupply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, \ndrinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of \nthe many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n\u2022 joint stiffness \n\n\n\n51 \n\n\u2022 joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n\u2022 difficulty with movement \n\n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \nDuring treatment for HIV there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  \nThis is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the \nHIV medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nOther effects in children  \n\n\u2022 Children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour including  \n\u2022 darkening of the skin in patches \n\n\u2022 Children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia). \n\u2022 this may cause the child to be tired or breathless  \n\n\uf0e0  If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what truvada is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "truvada contains two active substances, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. both of these active substances are antiretroviral medicines which are used to treat hiv infection. emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. however, both are generally known as nrtis and they work by interfering with the normal working of an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to reproduce itself. truvada is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus 1 (hiv-1) infection in adults it is also used to treat hiv in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg, and who have already been treated with other hiv medicines that are no longer effective or have caused side effects. \u2212 truvada should always be used combined with other medicines to treat hiv infection. \u2212 truvada can be administered in place of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil used separately at the same doses. people who are hiv positive can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. this medicine is not a cure for hiv infection. while taking truvada you may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with hiv infection. truvada is also used to reduce the risk of getting hiv-1 infection in adults, and adolescents aged 12 years to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg, when taken daily, together with safer sex practices: see section 2 for a list of precautions to take against hiv infection.",

"do not take truvada to treat hiv or to reduce the risk of getting hiv if you are allergic to emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. before taking truvada to reduce the risk of getting hiv: truvada can only help reduce your risk of getting hiv before you are infected. you must be hiv negative before you start to take truvada to reduce the risk of getting hiv. you must get tested to make sure that you do not already have hiv infection. do not take truvada to reduce your risk unless you are confirmed to be hiv negative. people who do have hiv must take truvada in combination with other drugs. many hiv tests can miss a recent infection. if you get a flu-like illness, it could mean you have recently been infected with hiv. these may be signs of hiv infection: tiredness fever joint or muscle aches headache vomiting or diarrhoea rash night sweats enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin tell your doctor about any flu-like illness either in the month before starting truvada, or at any time while taking truvada. warnings and precautions while taking truvada to reduce the risk of getting hiv: take truvada every day to reduce your risk, not just when you think you have been at risk of hiv infection. do not miss any doses of truvada, or stop taking it. missing doses may increase your risk of getting hiv infection. get tested for hiv regularly. if you think you were infected with hiv, tell your doctor straight away. they may want to do more tests to make sure you are still hiv negative. just taking truvada may not stop you getting hiv. o always practice safer sex. use condoms to reduce contact with semen, vaginal fluids, or blood. o do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, such as toothbrushes and razor blades. o do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment. o get tested for other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea. these infections make it easier for hiv to infect you. ask your doctor if you have any more questions about how to prevent getting hiv or spreading hiv to other people. while taking truvada to treat hiv or to reduce the risk of getting hiv: truvada may affect your kidneys. before and during treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to measure kidney function. tell your doctor if you have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown kidney problems. truvada should not be given to adolescents with existing kidney problems. if you have kidney problems, your doctor may advise you to stop taking truvada or, if you already have hiv, to take truvada less frequently. truvada is not recommended if you have severe kidney disease or are on dialysis. bone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, possible side effects). talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. patients infected with hiv who also have liver disease (including chronic hepatitis b or c), who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. if you have hepatitis b or c, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. know your hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection status before starting truvada. if you have hbv, there is a serious risk of liver problems when you stop taking truvada, whether or not you also have hiv. it is important not to stop taking truvada without talking to your doctor: see section 3, do not stop taking truvada. talk to your doctor if you are over 65. truvada has not been studied in patients over 65 years of age. talk to your doctor if you are intolerant to lactose (see truvada contains lactose later in this section). children and adolescents truvada is not for use in children under 12 years of age. other medicines and truvada do not take truvada if you are already taking other medicines that contain the components of truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil) or any other antiviral medicines that contain tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. taking truvada with other medicines that can damage your kidneys: it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines, including aminoglycosides (for bacterial infection) amphotericin b (for fungal infection) foscarnet (for viral infection) ganciclovir (for viral infection) pentamidine (for infections) vancomycin (for bacterial infection) interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) cidofovir (for viral infection) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids, to relieve bone or muscle pains) if you are taking another antiviral medicine called a protease inhibitor to treat hiv, your doctor may order blood tests to closely monitor your kidney function. it is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis c infection. taking truvada with other medicines containing didanosine (for treatment of hiv infection): taking truvada with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may reduce cd4 cell counts. rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes causes death, have been reported when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. truvada with food and drink whenever possible, truvada should be taken with food. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. if you have taken truvada during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. in children whose mothers took nrtis during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against hiv outweighed the risk of side effects. do not breast-feed during treatment with truvada. this is because the active substances in this medicine pass into human breast milk. if you are a woman with hiv it is recommended that you do not breast-feed, to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. driving and using machines truvada can cause dizziness. if you feel dizzy while taking truvada, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines. truvada contains lactose if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. truvada contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium- free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "truvada",

serious side effects: lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect. lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are overweight, and in people with liver disease. the following may be signs of lactic acidosis: deep rapid breathing drowsiness feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) stomach pain if you think you may have lactic acidosis, get medical help immediately. any signs of inflammation or infection. in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur after you start taking medicines to treat hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as: muscle weakness weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity if you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, get medical help immediately. possible side effects: very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea) dizziness, headache rash feeling weak tests may also show: decreases in phosphate in the blood 50 increased creatine kinase common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) pain, stomach pain difficulty sleeping, abnormal dreams problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals, feeling bloated, flatulence rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), which may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin in patches other allergic reactions, such as wheezing, swelling or feeling light-headed tests may also show: low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to infection) increased triglycerides (fatty acids), bile or sugar in the blood liver and pancreas problems uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat anaemia (low red blood cell count) breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness which may occur due to damage to the kidney tubule cells tests may also show: decreases in potassium in the blood increased creatinine in your blood changes to your urine rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) lactic acidosis (see possible serious side effects) fatty liver yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the liver inflammation of the kidney, passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty, kidney failure, damage to kidney tubule cells softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) back pain caused by kidney problems damage to kidney tubule cells may be associated with breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood. if you notice any of the side effects listed above or if any of the side effects get serious, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. the frequency of the following side effects is not known. bone problems. some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as truvada may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are: joint stiffness 51 joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) difficulty with movement if you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. during treatment for hiv there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. other effects in children children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin in patches children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia). this may cause the child to be tired or breathless if you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "truvada", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
