NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nCarbaglu 200 mg dispersible tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\n2.1 General description  \n\nEach tablet contains 200 mg of carglumic acid. \n\n \n\n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition  \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nDispersible tablet \n\nThe tablets are white and elongated with three score marks and engraved on one side. \n\nThe tablet can be divided into equal halves. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nCarbaglu is indicated in treatment of  \n\n hyperammonaemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase primary deficiency. \n\n hyperammonaemia due to isovaleric acidaemia. \n\n hyperammonaemia due to methymalonic acidaemia. \n\n hyperammonaemia due to propionic acidaemia. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nCarbaglu treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ntreatment of metabolic disorders. \n\n \n\nPosology: \n\n \n\n For N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency: \n\nBased on clinical experience, the treatment may be started as early as the first day of life. \n\nThe initial daily dose should be 100 mg/kg, up to 250 mg/kg if necessary. \n\nIt should then be adjusted individually in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels (see \n\nsection 4.4).  \n\nIn the long term, it may not be necessary to increase the dose according to body weight as long as \n\nadequate metabolic control is achieved; daily doses range from 10 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nCarglumic acid responsiveness test \n\nIt is recommended to test individual responsiveness to carglumic acid before initiating any long term \n\ntreatment. As examples  \n\n-  In a comatose child, start with a dose of 100 to 250 mg/kg/day and measure ammonia plasma \n\nconcentration at least before each administration; it should normalise within a few hours after \n\nstarting Carbaglu. \n\n-  In a patient with moderate hyperammonaemia, administer a test dose of 100 to 200 mg/kg/day \n\nfor 3 days with a constant protein intake and perform repeated determinations of ammonia \n\nplasma concentration (before and 1 hour after a meal); adjust the dose in order to maintain \n\nnormal ammonia plasma levels. \n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\n \n\n For isovaleric acidaemia, methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: \n\nThe treatment should start upon hyperammonaemia in organic acidaemia patients. The initial daily \n\ndose should be 100 mg/kg, up to 250 mg/kg if necessary. \n\nIt should then be individually adjusted in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration: \n\n \n\nThis medicine is for oral use ONLY (ingestion or via a nasogastric tube using a syringe, if necessary). \n\n \n\nBased on pharmacokinetic data and clinical experience, it is recommended to divide the total daily \n\ndose into two to four doses to be given before meals or feedings. The breaking of the tablets in halves \n\nallows most of the required posology adjustments. Occasionally, the use of quarter tablets may also be \n\nuseful to adjust the posology prescribed by the physician. \n\nThe tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 5-10 ml of water and ingested immediately or \n\nadministered by fast push through a syringe via a nasogastric tube. \n\n \n\nThe suspension has a slightly acidic taste. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\nBreast-feeding during the use of carglumic acid is contraindicated (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTherapeutic monitoring \n\nPlasma levels of ammonia and amino acids should be maintained within normal limits. \n\nAs very few data on the safety of carglumic acid are available, systematic surveillance of liver, renal, \n\ncardiac functions and haematological parameters is recommended. \n\n \n\nNutritional management \n\nProtein restriction and arginine supplementation may be indicated in case of low protein tolerance. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo specific interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nFor carglumic acid no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n\nAnimal studies have revealed minimal developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Caution should be \n\nexercised when prescribing to pregnant women.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nAlthough it is not known whether carglumic acid is secreted into human milk, it has been shown to be \n\npresent in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Therefore, breast-feeding during the use of \n\ncarglumic acid is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nReported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are \n\ndefined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥1/100 to 1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 1/100), rare \n\n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n- Undesirable effects in N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency \n\n \n\nInvestigations  Uncommon: increased transaminases \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon: increased sweating \n\nNot known: rash \n\n \n\n- Undesirable effects in organic acidaemia \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\nUncommon: bradycardia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nUncommon: diarrhoea, vomiting \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nAdministration site conditions \n\n \n\nUncommon: pyrexia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nNot known: rash \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn one patient treated with carglumic acid, where the dose was increased up to 750 mg/kg/day, \n\nsymptoms of intoxication occurred which can be characterised as a sympathomimetic reaction: \n\ntachycardia, profuse sweating, increased bronchial secretion, increased body temperature and \n\nrestlessness. These symptoms resolved once the dose was reduced. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Amino acids and derivatives; ATC code: A16AA05 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nCarglumic acid is a structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate, which is the naturally occurring \n\nactivator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, the first enzyme of the urea cycle. \n\nCarglumic acid has been shown in vitro to activate liver carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Despite a \n\nlower affinity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase for carglumic acid than for N-acetylglutamate, \n\ncarglumic acid has been shown in vivo to stimulate carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and to be much \n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\nmore effective than N-acetylglutamate in protecting against ammonia intoxication in rats. This could \n\nbe explained by the following observations: \n\ni) The mitochondrial membrane is more readily permeable for carglumic acid than for N-\n\nacetylglutamate \n\nii) Carglumic acid is more resistant than N-acetylglutamate to hydrolysis by aminoacylase present in \n\nthe cytosol. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\nOther studies have been conducted in rats under different experimental conditions leading to \n\nincreased ammonia availability (starvation, protein-free or high-protein diet). Carglumic acid was \n\nshown to decrease blood ammonia levels and increase urea levels in blood and urine, whereas the \n\nliver content of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activators was significantly increased. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\nIn patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, carglumic acid was shown to induce a rapid \n\nnormalisation of plasma ammonia levels, usually within 24 hours. When the treatment was instituted \n\nbefore any permanent brain damage, patients exhibited normal growth and psychomotor development. \n\nIn patients with organic acidaemia (neonates and non-neonates), the treatment with carglumic acid \n\ninduced a quick decrease of ammonia plasma levels, reducing the risk of neurological complications. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid has been studied in healthy male volunteers using both \n\nradiolabelled and unlabelled product. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, approximately 30% of carglumic acid is estimated \n\nto be absorbed. At that dose-level, in 12 volunteers given Carbaglu tablets, plasma concentration \n\npeaked at 2.6 µg/ml (median; range 1.8-4.8) after 3 hours (median; range 2-4). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe plasma elimination curve of carglumic acid is biphasic with a rapid phase over the first 12 hours \n\nafter administration followed by a slow phase (terminal half life up to 28 hours). \n\nDiffusion into erythrocytes is non existent. Protein binding has not been determined. \n\n \n\nMetabolism \n\nA proportion of carglumic acid is metabolised. It is suggested that depending on its activity, the \n\nintestinal bacterial flora may contribute to the initiation of the degradation process, thus leading to a \n\nvariable extent of metabolism of the molecule. One metabolite that has been identified in the faeces is \n\nglutamic acid. Metabolites are detectable in plasma with a peak at 36-48 hours and a very slow \n\ndecline (half-life around 100 hours). \n\nThe end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, which is eliminated through the \n\nlungs. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nAfter a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, 9% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine \n\nand up to 60% in the faeces. \n\n \n\nPlasma levels of carglumic acid were measured in patients of all age categories, from newborn infants \n\nto adolescents, treated with various daily doses (7 – 122 mg/kg/day). Their range was consistent with \n\nthose measured in healthy adults, even in newborn infants. Whatever the daily dose, they were slowly \n\ndeclining over 15 hours to levels around 100 ng/ml. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies have shown that Carbaglu administered orally at doses of 250, 500, \n\n1000 mg/kg had no statistically significant effect on respiration, central nervous system and \n\ncardiovascular system. \n\n \n\nCarbaglu showed no significant mutagenic activity in a battery of genotoxicity tests performed in \n\nvitro (Ames test, human lymphocyte metaphase analysis) and in vivo (micronucleus test in rat). \n\n \n\nSingle doses of carglumic acid up to 2800 mg/kg orally and 239 mg/kg intravenously did not induce \n\nany mortality or abnormal clinical signs in adult rats. In newborn rats receiving daily carglumic acid \n\nby oral gavage for 18 days as well as in young rats receiving daily carglumic acid for 26 weeks, the \n\nNo Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was established at 500 mg/kg/day and the No Observed Adverse \n\nEffect Level (NOAEL) was established at 1000 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nNo adverse effects have been observed on male or female fertility. In rats and rabbits no evidence has \n\nbeen seen of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity up to maternotoxic doses leading to fifty \n\ntimes exposure as compared to humans in rats and seven times in rabbits. Carglumic acid is secreted \n\nin the milk of lactating rats and although developmental parameters were unaffected, there were some \n\neffects on body weight / body weight gain of pups breast-fed by dams treated with 500 mg/kg/day and \n\na higher mortality of pups from dams treated with 2000 mg/kg/day, a dose that caused \n\nmaternotoxicity. The maternal systemic exposures after 500 and 2000 mg/kg/day were twenty five \n\ntimes and seventy times the expected human exposure. \n\n \n\nNo carcinogenicity study has been conducted with carglumic acid. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT CARBAGLU IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nCarbaglu can help eliminating excessive ammonia plasma levels (elevated ammonia level in the \n\nblood). Ammonia is especially toxic for the brain and leads, in severe cases, to reduced levels of \n\nconsciousness and to coma. \n\nHyperammonaemia may be  due to \n\n the lack of a specific liver enzyme N- acetylglutamate synthase. Patients with this rare disorder \n\nare not able to eliminate nitrogen waste, which builds up after eating protein. \n\n This disorder persists during the entire life of the affected patient and therefore the need for this \n\n treatment is lifelong. \n\n isovaleric acidaemia, methylmalonic acidaemia or propionic acidaemia. Patients suffering from \n\none of these disorders need treatment during the hyperammonaemia crisis. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE CARBAGLU \n\n \n\nDo not take Carbaglu: \n\nDo not take Carbaglu if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to carglumic acid or any of the other \n\ningredients of Carbaglu. \n\nDo not take Carbaglu during breast-feeding \n\n \n\nTake special care with Carbaglu: \n\nCarbaglu treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ntreatment of metabolic disorders. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will evaluate your individual responsiveness to carglumic acid before initiating any long \n\nterm treatment.  \n\nThe dose should be individually adjusted in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may prescribe supplemental arginine or restrict your protein intake. \n\n \n\nIn order to follow-up your condition and your treatment, your doctor may examine your liver, your \n\nkidneys, your heart and your blood on a regular basis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 20 \n\nTaking other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nTaking Carbaglu with food and drink \n\nCarbaglu must be taken orally before meals or feedings. \n\nThe tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 5 to 10 ml of water and taken immediately. The \n\nsuspension has a slightly acidic taste. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and Breast-feeding \n\nThe effects of Carbaglu on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. Please consult your doctor \n\nfor advice if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n\nThe excretion of carglumic acid into breast milk has not been studied in women. Nevertheless, as \n\ncarglumic acid has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats with potential toxic effects \n\nfor their fed pups, you should not breast feed your baby if you are taking Carbaglu. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nEffects on the ability to drive and use machines are not known. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

You should check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are unsure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose: \n\nthe initial daily dose is usually 100 mg per kilogram of body weight, up to a maximum of 250 mg per \n\nkilogram of body weight (for example, if you weight 10kg, you should take 1g per day, or 5 tablets), \n\nFor patients suffering from N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, in the long term, the daily dose \n\nusually ranges from 10 mg to 100 mg per kilogram of body weight.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will determine the dose suitable to you in order to maintain normal ammonia levels in \n\nyour blood. \n\n \n\nCarbaglu should ONLY be administered by mouth or via a feeding tube into the stomach (using a \n\nsyringe, if necessary). \n\n \n\nWhen the patient is in hyperammonaemic coma, Carbaglu is administered by fast push through a \n\nsyringe via the tube set up and used to feed you. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Carbaglu than you should \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Carbaglu \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Carbaglu \n\nDo not stop Carbaglu without informing your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 21 \n\n4.
