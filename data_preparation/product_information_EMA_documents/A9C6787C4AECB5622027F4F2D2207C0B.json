CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReagila is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended starting dose of cariprazine is 1.5 mg once daily. Thereafter the dose can be \nincreased slowly in 1.5 mg increments to a maximum dose of 6 mg/day, if needed. The lowest \neffective dose should be maintained according to the clinical judgement of the treating physician. \nBecause of the long half-life of cariprazine and its active metabolites, changes in dose will not be fully \nreflected in plasma for several weeks. Patients should be monitored for adverse reactions and \ntreatment response for several weeks after starting cariprazine and after each dosage change (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nSwitching from other antipsychotics to cariprazine \nWhen switching from another antipsychotic to cariprazine gradual cross-titration should be \nconsidered, with gradual discontinuation of the previous treatment while cariprazine treatment is \ninitiated. \n \nSwitching to another antipsychotic from cariprazine \nWhen switching to another antipsychotic from cariprazine, no gradual cross-titration is needed, the \nnew antipsychotic should be initiated in its lowest dose while cariprazine is discontinued. It should be \nconsidered that plasma concentration of cariprazine and its active metabolites will decline by 50% in \n~1 week (see section 5.2). \n \nSpecial population \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Creatinine \nClearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min and < 89 mL/min). Safety and efficacy of cariprazine have not been \nevaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Use of cariprazine is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \n\n\n\n \n4 \n\nscore between 5-9). Safety and efficacy of cariprazine have not been evaluated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 10 and 15). Use of cariprazine is not recommended in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly \nAvailable data in elderly patients aged ≥65 years treated with cariprazine are not sufficient to \ndetermine whether or not they respond differently from younger patients (see section 5.2). Dose \nselection for an elderly patient should be more cautious. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of cariprazine in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nReagila is for oral use, to be taken once daily at the same time of the day with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nConcomitant administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.5). \nConcomitant administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nThe possibility of suicidality (suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide) is inherent in \npsychotic illnesses and, generally, it is reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic \ntherapy. Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy. \n \nAkathisia, restlessness \n \nAkathisia and restlessness is a frequently occurring adverse reaction of antipsychotics. Akathisia is a \nmovement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling need to be in \nconstant motion, as well as by actions such as rocking while standing or sitting, lifting the feet as if \nmarching on the spot, and crossing and uncrossing the legs while sitting. As cariprazine causes \nakathisia and restlessness, it should be used cautiously in patients who are prone to or already exhibit \nsymptoms of akathisia. Akathisia develops early in treatment. Therefore close monitoring in the first \nphase of treatment is important. Prevention includes slow up-titration; treatment measures include \nslight down-titration of cariprazine or anti-EPS medication. The dose can be modified based on \nindividual response and tolerability (see section 4.8). \n \nTardive dyskinesia \n \nTardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, rhythmical, involuntary \nmovements, predominantly of the tongue and/or face that can develop in patients treated with \nantipsychotics. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with \ncariprazine, discontinuation should be considered. \n \nParkinson's disease \n \nIf prescribed to patients with Parkinson's disease, antipsychotic medicinal products may exacerbate the \nunderlying disease and worsen symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Physicians should, therefore, weigh \nthe risks versus the benefits when prescribing cariprazine to patients with Parkinson's disease. \n \nOcular symptoms/cataract \n\n\n\n \n5 \n\n \nIn the preclinical studies of cariprazine lens opacity/cataract was detected in dogs (see sections 4.8 and \n5.3). However, a causal relationship between lenticular changes / cataracts observed in human studies \nand cariprazine use has not been established. Nevertheless, patients who would develop symptoms \npotentially related to cataract should be advised to ophthalmologic examination and re-evaluated for \ntreatment continuation. \n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) \n \nA potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been \nreported in association with antipsychotic treatment. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, \nmuscle rigidity, elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels, altered mental status and evidence of \nautonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac \ndysrhythmia). Additional signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. \nIf a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever \nwithout additional clinical manifestations of NMS, cariprazine must be discontinued immediately. \n \nSeizures and convulsions \n \nCariprazine should be used cautiously in patients with history of seizures or with conditions that \npotentially lower the seizure threshold. \n \nElderly patients with dementia \n \nCariprazine has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia and is not recommended to treat \nelderly patients with dementia due to increased risk of overall mortality.  \n \nRisk of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) \n \nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \nrandomised placebo controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \nantipsychotics. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be \nexcluded for other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Cariprazine should be used with caution \nin patients with risk factors for stroke. \n \nCardiovascular disorders \n \nBlood pressure changes \nCariprazine can cause orthostatic hypotension as well as hypertension (see section 4.8). Cariprazine \nshould be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease predisposing to blood \npressure changes. Blood pressure should be monitored. \n \nECG changes \nQT prolongation can develop in patients treated with antipsychotics. \nWith cariprazine no QT interval prolongation was detected compared to placebo in a clinical trial \ndesigned to assess QT prolongation (see section 5.1). In clinical trials, only a few, non-serious, QT-\nprolongations have been reported with cariprazine (see section 4.8). Therefore, cariprazine should be \nused cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular disease or in patients with a family history of \nQT prolongation and in patients treated with medicinal products that might cause QT prolongation \n(see section 5.1). \n \nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) \nCases of venous thromboembolism have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. Since \npatients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk \nfactors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with cariprazine and preventive \nmeasures undertaken. \n \n\n\n\n \n6 \n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n \nPatients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or patients with risk factors for diabetes \nmellitus (e.g. obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical \nantipsychotics should be monitored for serum glucose levels. In clinical trials, glucose-related adverse \nreactions have been reported with cariprazine (see section 5.1). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking cariprazine and \nat least for 10 weeks after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). Women using systemically \nacting hormonal contraceptives should add a second barrier method. \n \nWeight change \n \nSignificant weight gain has been observed with the use of cariprazine. Patients should have their \nweight monitored regularly (see section 4.8). \n \nExcipients \n \nReagila 3 mg, 4.5 mg and 6 mg hard capsules contain Allura red AC (E 129), which may cause \nallergic reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect cariprazine \n \nMetabolism of cariprazine and its major active metabolites, desmethyl cariprazine (DCAR) and \ndidesmethyl cariprazine (DDCAR), is mediated mainly by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution of \nCYP2D6. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nKetoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused two fold increase in plasma exposure for total \ncariprazine (sum of cariprazine and its active metabolites) during short-term (4 days) \nco-administration, either if unbound or unbound+bound moieties considered. \nDue to the long half-life of the active moieties of cariprazine a further increase in plasma exposure of \ntotal cariprazine can be expected during longer co-administration. Therefore, co-administration of \ncariprazine with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, cobicistat, \nindinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole verapamil) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). Consumption of grapefruit juice should be avoided. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nCo-administration of cariprazine with strong and moderate inducers of CYP3A4 may result in a \nsignificant decrease in total cariprazine exposure, therefore the co-administration of cariprazine and \nstrong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, St. \nJohn’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors \nCYP2D6 mediated pathway plays a minor role in the metabolism of cariprazine, the major pathway is \nvia CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore CYP2D6 inhibitors are unlikely to have a clinically relevant \neffect on cariprazine metabolism. \n \nPotential for cariprazine to affect other medicinal products \n \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates \n\n\n\n \n7 \n\nCariprazine is a P-gp inhibitor in vitro at its theoretical maximum intestinal concentration. The clinical \nconsequences of this effect is not fully understood, however the use of P-gp substrates with narrow \ntherapeutic index such as dabigatran and digoxin could require extra monitoring and dose adjustment. \n \nHormonal contraceptives \nIt is currently unknown whether cariprazine may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting \nhormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives \nshould add a second barrier method. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nGiven the primary central nervous system effects of cariprazine, Reagila should be used with caution \nin combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on Reagila. Female \npatients of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment \nand for at least 10 weeks following the last dose of Reagila. It is currently unknown if cariprazine may \nreduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives and therefore women using \nsystemically acting hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method (see section 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of cariprazine in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including developmental malformations in rats \n(see section 5.3). \n \nReagila is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \neffective contraception. After discontinuation of cariprazine treatment contraception should be used \nfor at least 10 weeks due to the slow elimination of active moieties. \n \nNeonates exposed to antipsychotics (including cariprazine) during the third trimester of pregnancy are \nat risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in \nseverity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, \ntremor, somnolence, respiratory distress or feeding disorder. These complications have varied in \nseverity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases, neonates have required \nintensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Consequently, newborns should be \nmonitored carefully. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether cariprazine or its major active metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nCariprazine and its metabolites are excreted in milk of rats during lactation (see section 5.3). A risk to \nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \ncariprazine. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of cariprazine on human fertility has not been evaluated. In rat studies lower female fertility \nand conception indices were observed (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCariprazine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should \n\n\n\n \n8 \n\nbe cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably \ncertain that therapy with Reagila does not affect them adversely. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported ADRs with cariprazine in the dose range (1.5-6 mg) were akathisia \n(19%) and parkinsonism (17.5%). Most events were mild to moderate in severity. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) based upon pooled data from cariprazine schizophrenia studies are \nshown by system organ class and by preferred term. \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked by frequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: \nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000) very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Therefore, \ncataract formation was closely monitored with slit lamp examinations in the clinical studies and \npatients with existing cataracts were excluded. During the schizophrenia clinical development program \nof cariprazine, few cataract cases were reported, characterized with minor lens opacities with no visual \nimpairment (13/3192; 0.4%). Some of these patients had confounding factors. The most commonly \nreported ocular adverse event was blurred vision (placebo: 1/683; 0.1%, cariprazine: 22/2048; 1.1%). \n \nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) \nIn the short term studies the incidence of EPS was observed in 27%; 11.5%; 30.7% and 15.1% in \npatients treated with cariprazine, placebo, risperidone and aripiprazole respectively. Akathisia was \nreported in 13.6%; 5.1%; 9.3% and 9.9% in patients treated with cariprazine, placebo, risperidone and \naripiprazole respectively. Parkinsonism was experienced in 13.6%; 5.7%; 22.1% and 5.3% in patients \ntreated with cariprazine, placebo, risperidone and aripiprazole respectively. Dystonia was observed in \n1.8%; 0.2%; 3.6% and 0.7% in patients on cariprazine, placebo, risperidone and aripiprazole, \nrespectively.  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled part of the long-term maintenance of effect study EPS was 13.7% in the \ncariprazine group compared to 3.0% in the placebo treated patients. Akathisia was reported in 3.9% in \npatients treated with cariprazine, versus 2.0% in the placebo group. Parkinsonism was experienced in \n7.8% and 1.0% in cariprazine and placebo group respectively.  \n \nIn the negative symptom study EPS was reported in 14.3% in the cariprazine group and 11.7% in the \nrisperidone treated patients. Akathisia was reported in 10.0% in patients treated with cariprazine and \n5.2% in the risperidone group. Parkinsonism was experienced in 5.2% and 7.4% in cariprazine and \nrisperidone treated patients respectively. Most EPS cases were mild to moderate in intensity and could \nbe handled with common anti-EPS medicinal products. The rate of discontinuation due to EPS related \nADRs was low. \n \nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) \nCases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein \nthrombosis have been reported with antipsychotics - Frequency unknown. \n \nElevated liver transaminases \nElevated liver transaminases (ALT, AST) are frequently observed with antipsychotic treatment. In the \ncariprazine clinical studies the incidence of ALT, AST elevation ADRs occurred in 2.2% of \ncariprazine-, 1.6% of risperidone- and 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. None of the cariprazine-\n\n\n\n \n11 \n\ntreated patients had any liver damage. \n \nWeight changes \nIn the short term studies, there were slightly greater mean increases in body weight in the cariprazine \ngroup compared to the placebo group; 1 kg and 0.3 kg, respectively. In the long term maintenance of \neffect study, there was no clinically relevant difference in change of body weight from baseline to end \nof treatment (1.1 kg for cariprazine and 0.9 kg for placebo). In the open-label phase of the study \nduring 20 weeks cariprazine treatment 9.0% of patients developed potentially clinically significant \n(PCS) weight gain (defined as increase ≥ 7%) while during the double-blind phase, 9.8 % of the \npatients who continued with cariprazine treatment had PCS weight gain versus 7.1% of the patients \nwho were randomized to placebo after the 20 week open-label cariprazine treatment. In the negative \nsymptom study, the mean change of body weight was -0.3 kg for cariprazine and +0.6 kg for \nrisperidone and PCS weight gain was observed in 6% of the cariprazine group while 7.4% of the \nrisperidone group.  \n \nQT- prolongation \nWith cariprazine no QT interval prolongation was detected compared to placebo in a clinical trial \ndesigned to assess QT prolongation (see section 5.1). In other clinical trials, only a few, non-serious, \nQT-prolongations have been reported with cariprazine. During the long-term, open-label treatment \nperiod in, 3 patients (0.4%) had QTcB > 500 msec, one of whom also had QTcF > 500 msec. A > 60 \nmsec increase from baseline was observed in 7 patients (1%) for QTcB and in 2 patients (0.3%) for \nQTcF. In the long-term , maintenance of effect study, during the open-label phase, > 60 msec increase \nof from baseline was observed in 12 patients (1.6%) for QTcB and in 4 patients (0.5%) for QTcF. \nDuring the double-blind treatment period, > 60 msec increases from baseline in QTcB were observed \nin 3 cariprazine-treated patients (3.1%) and 2 placebo-treated patients (2%). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nAccidental acute overdose (48 mg/day) was reported in one patient. This patient experienced \northostasis and sedation. The patient fully recovered the same day. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy including maintenance of an \nadequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation and management of symptoms. Cardiovascular \nmonitoring should commence immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for \npossible arrhythmias. In case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medicinal products \nshould be administered. Since cariprazine is highly bound to plasma proteins, haemodialysis is \nunlikely to be useful in the management of overdose. Close medical supervision and monitoring \nshould continue until the patient recovers. \nThere is no specific antidote to cariprazine. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX15 \n\n\n\n \n12 \n\n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism of action of cariprazine is not fully known. However the therapeutic effect of \ncariprazine may be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at dopamine D3, D2 (Ki \nvalues of 0.085-0.3 nM versus 0.49-0.71 nM respectively) and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors (Ki values \nof 1.4-2.6 nM), and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT2B, 5-HT2A and histamine H1 receptors (Ki \nvalues of 0.58-1.1 nM, 18.8 nM and 23.3 nM, respectively). Cariprazine has low affinity for serotonin \n5-HT2C and adrenergic α1 receptors (Ki values of 134 nM and 155 nM, respectively). Cariprazine has \nno appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50 > 1000 nM). The two major active \nmetabolites, desmethyl cariprazine and didesmethyl cariprazine have a similar in vitro receptor \nbinding and functional activity profile as the parent drug. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn vivo non-clinical studies demonstrated that cariprazine occupies D3 receptors to a similar extent as \nD2 receptors at pharmacologically effective doses. There was a dose-dependent occupancy of brain \ndopamine D3 and D2 receptors (with preferential occupancy in regions with higher D3 expression) in \npatients with schizophrenia within the therapeutic dose range of cariprazine for 15 days. \n \nThe effects of cariprazine on the QT interval were evaluated in patients with schizophrenia or \nschizoaffective disorder. Holter monitor-derived electrocardiographic assessments were obtained in \n129 patients over a twelve hour period at baseline and steady state. No QT interval prolongation was \ndetected following supratherapeutic doses (9 mg/day or 18 mg/day). No patients treated with \ncariprazine experienced QTc increases ≥ 60 msec from baseline, nor did any patient experience a QTc \nof > 500 msec in the study. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nEfficacy with short-term use \nThe efficacy of cariprazine for the treatment of acute schizophrenia was studied in three multi-center, \nmultinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week trials including 1,754 patients \nwith the age of 18 to 60 years. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 6 in the \nPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and the secondary endpoint was change \nfrom baseline to week 6 in the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score in all acute \nschizophrenia studies. In a multinational placebo controlled study using fixed doses of 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg \nand 4.5 mg cariprazine and 4.0 mg risperidone for assay sensitivity, all cariprazine doses and the \nactive-control showed statistically significant improvement in both primary as well as secondary \nendpoint compared to placebo. In another multinational placebo controlled study using fixed doses of \n3.0 mg, and 6.0 mg cariprazine and 10 mg aripiprazole for assay sensitivity, both cariprazine doses \nand the active-control showed statistically significant improvement in both primary as well as \nsecondary endpoint compared to placebo. In a third multinational placebo controlled study using \nfixed/flexible doses of 3.0-6.0 mg and 6.0-9.0 mg cariprazine, both cariprazine doses groups showed \nstatistically significant improvement in both primary as well as secondary endpoint compared to \nplacebo. \nResults for the primary outcome parameter are summarized in Table 1 below. Results for the \nsecondary outcome parameter (CGI) and additional endpoints were supportive of the primary \nendpoint. \n \nTable 1.

Totally, 751 patients with acute symptoms of schizophrenia \nreceived cariprazine 3-9 mg/day for 20 weeks, of whom 337 received cariprazine in the dose-range of \n3 or 6 mg/day. Stabilized patients were then randomised to receive fixed doses of 3 or 6 mg \ncariprazine (n=51) or placebo (n=51) in a double-blind manner for up to 72 weeks. The primary \noutcome of the study was time to relapse. By the end of the trial 49.0% of placebo-treated patients \nversus 21.6% of cariprazine-treated patients had a relapse of schizophrenic symptoms. Time to relapse \n(92 vs. 326 days-based on the 25th percentile) was therefore significantly longer in the cariprazine \ngroup than in the placebo group (p=0.009). \n \nEfficacy in predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia \nThe efficacy of cariprazine for the treatment of predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia \nwas investigated in a 26-week, multi-centre, double-blind, and active-controlled clinical trial. \nCariprazine (dose range 3-6 mg, target dose 4.5 mg) was investigated compared to risperidone (dose \nrange 3-6 mg, target dose 4 mg) in patients with persistent, predominant negative symptoms of \nschizophrenia (n=461). 86% of patients were less than 55 years old, 54% of them were male. \n \nPersistent predominant negative symptoms were defined as symptoms lasting for a period of at least \n6 months with high level of negative symptoms and low level of positive symptoms [(PANSS factor \nscore for negative symptoms ≥ 24, a score of ≥ 4 on a minimum 2 of the 3 PANSS items (N1: flat \naffect, N4: avolition, and N6: poverty of speech) and PANSS factor score for positive symptoms \n≤ 19]. Patients with secondary negative symptoms, such as moderate to severe depressive symptoms \nand clinically relevant parkinsonism (EPS) were excluded. \n \nBoth cariprazine- and risperidone-treated patient groups have shown statistically significant \nimprovement in the change from baseline for the primary efficacy parameter, PANSS factor score for \nnegative symptoms (PANSS-FSNS) (p< 0.001). However, a statistically significant difference \n(p=0.002) in favour of cariprazine over risperidone was observed from Week 14 onward (Table 2). \nBoth cariprazine- and risperidone-treated patient groups have shown statistically significant \nimprovement in the change from baseline for the secondary efficacy parameter, Personal and Social \nPerformance (PSP) total score (p< 0.001). However, a statistically significant difference (p< 0.001) in \nfavour of cariprazine over risperidone was observed from Week 10 onward (Table 2). \nDifferences on the Clinical Global Impression Severity (p=0.005) and Improvement (p<0.001) scales, \nas well as PANSS-FSNS response rates (PANSS FSNS ≥ 30% improvement at Week 26; p= 0.003) \n\n\n\n \n14 \n\nwere supportive of findings on the primary and secondary efficacy parameters. \n \nTable 2 Summary of results in study RGH-188-005 \n \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ncariprazine in paediatric population. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCariprazine has two pharmacologically active metabolites with similar activites as cariprazine, \ndesmethyl cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethyl cariprazine (DDCAR). Total cariprazine (sum of \ncariprazine + DCAR and DDCAR) exposure approaches 50% of steady state exposure in ~1 week of \ndaily dosing while 90% of steady state is achieved in 3 weeks. At steady state, exposure to DDCAR is \napproximately two to three-fold higher than to cariprazine, and exposure to DCAR is approximately \n30% of cariprazine exposure. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAbsolute bioavailability of cariprazine is unknown. Cariprazine is well absorbed after oral \nadministration. Following multiple-dose administration, peak plasma concentrations for cariprazine \nand the major active metabolites generally occur at approximately 3-8 hours post dose. \nAdministration of a single dose of 1.5 mg cariprazine with a high-fat meal (900 to 1,000 calories) did \nnot significantly affect the Cmax or AUC of cariprazine (AUC0-∞ increased by 12%, Cmax decreased by \n< 5% under fed condition versus fasting). The effect of food on the exposure of the metabolites DCAR \nand DDCAR was also minimal. \nCariprazine can be administered with or without food. \n \nDistribution \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 916 L \nfor cariprazine, 475 L for DCAR and 1,568 L for DDCAR, indicating extensive distribution of \ncariprazine and its major active metabolites. Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are highly \nbound (96 to 97% for CAR, 94% to 97% for DCAR and 92% to 97% for DDCAR) to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe metabolism of cariprazine involves demethylation (DCAR and DDCAR), hydroxylation (hydroxy \ncariprazine, HCAR) and a combination of demethylation and hydroxylation (hydroxy desmethyl \ncariprazine, HDCAR and hydroxy didesmethyl cariprazine, HDDCAR). The metabolites of HCAR, \nHDCAR, and HDDCAR are subsequently biotransformed to their corresponding sulfate and \nglucuronide conjugates. An additional metabolite, desdichlorophenyl piperazine cariprazine \n(DDCPPCAR) acid, is produced by dealkylation and subsequent oxidation of cariprazine. \n\nEfficacy parameter Cariprazine \nLS mean \n\nRisperidone \nLS mean \n\nEstimated \nTreatment \nDifference \n\n95%CI p-value \n\nPANSS-FSNS at Baseline 27.8 27.5 - - - \nPANSS-FSNS at Week 26 18.5 19.6 - - - \nPANSS-FSNS CfB to \nWeek 26 \n\n-8.9 -7.4 -1.5 -2,4; -\n0.5 \n\n0.002 \n\nTotal PSP at Baseline 48.8 48.2 - - - \nTotal PSP at Week 26 64.0 59.7 - - - \nTotal PSP CfB to Week 26 14.3 9.7 4.6 2.7; 6.6 <0.001 \nCfB= change from baseline \n\n\n\n \n15 \n\nCariprazine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6, to DCAR and HCAR. \nDCAR is further metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 into DDCAR and \nHDCAR. DDCAR is further metabolised to HDDCAR by CYP3A4. \n \nCariprazine and its major active metabolites are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the organic \nanion transporting polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), and the breast cancer \nresistance protein (BCRP). This suggests that an interaction of cariprazine with inhibitors of P-gp, \nOATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP is unlikely. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination of cariprazine and its major active metabolites is mainly through hepatic metabolism. \nFollowing administration of 12.5 mg/day cariprazine to patients with schizophrenia, 20.8% of the dose \nwas excreted in urine as cariprazine and its metabolites. \nUnchanged cariprazine is excreted by 1.2% of the dose in urine and 3.7% of the dose in feces. \n \nThe mean terminal half-life (1 to 3 days for cariprazine and DCAR and 13 to 19 days for DDCAR) is \nnot predictive of time to reach steady state or plasma concentration decline after treatment \ndiscontinuation. For the management of patients treated with cariprazine, the effective half-life is more \nrelevant than the terminal half-life. The effective (functional) half-life is ~ 2 days for cariprazine and \nDCAR, 8 days for DDCAR and is ~1 week for total cariprazine. The plasma concentration of total \ncariprazine will gradually decline following dose discontinuation or interruption. The plasma \nconcentration of total cariprazine decreases by 50% in ~1 week and greater than 90% decline in total \ncariprazine concentration occurs in ~3 weeks. \n \nLinearity \n \nAfter repeated administration plasma exposure of cariprazine and its two major active metabolites, \ndesmethyl cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethyl cariprazine (DDCAR), increases proportionally over \nthe therapeutic dose range of 1.5 to 6 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling was performed using data from patients enrolled in the \nschizophrenia cariprazine clinical program with differing levels of renal function, including normal \nrenal function (creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 90 mL/min), as well as mild (CrCl 60 to 89 mL/min) and \nmoderate (CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment. No significant relationship was found between \ncariprazine plasma clearance and creatinine clearance. \nCariprazine has not been evaluated in patients with severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nA 2-part study (a single dose of 1 mg cariprazine [Part A] and a daily dose of 0.5 mg cariprazine for \n14 days [Part B] was conducted in patients with varying degrees of impaired hepatic function (Child-\nPugh Classes A and B). Compared to healthy subjects, patients with either mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment had up to approximately 25% higher exposure (Cmax and AUC) for cariprazine and up to \napproximately 45% lower exposure for the major active metabolites, desmethyl cariprazine and \ndidesmethyl cariprazine, following the single dose of 1 mg cariprazine or 0.5 mg cariprazine for \n14 days. \nThe total active moiety (CAR+DCAR+DDCAR) exposure (AUC and Cmax) decreased by 21-22% and \n13-15% in mild or moderate hepatic impairment (HI), respectively, compared to healthy subjects if \nunbound + bound concentrations were considered, while for unbound total moiety a decrease of 12-\n13% and an increase of 20-25% were calculated in mild HI patients and in moderate HI patients, \nrespectively, after multiple dosing of cariprazine. \nCariprazine has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) \n(see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n16 \n\n \nAge, gender and race \nIn the population PK analysis there were no clinically relevant differences in the PK parameters (AUC \nand Cmax of the sum of cariprazine and its major active metabolites) based on age, gender and race. \nThis analysis included 2,844 patients of different races, involving 536 patients between the ages of 50 \nand 65. Of the 2,844 patients 933 were female (see section 4.2). In elderly patients above 65 years of \nage data are limited. \n \nSmoking status \nBecause cariprazine is not a substrate for CYP1A2, smoking is not expected to have an effect on the \npharmacokinetics of cariprazine. \n \nPotential for cariprazine to affect other medicinal products \n \nCariprazine and its major active metabolites did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes \nand were not inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP219, CYP2D6, \nCYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are not inhibitors of \ntransporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), and organic anion \ntransporters 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3) in vitro. DCAR and DDCAR were not inhibitors of \ntransporter P-gp although cariprazine was a P-gp inhibitor in the intestine (see section 4.5). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCariprazine caused bilateral cataract and secondary retinal changes (retinal detachment and cystic \ndegeneration) in the dog. The exposure (AUC of total cariprazine) at the no-observed-adverse-effect-\nlevel (NOAEL) for ocular toxicity is 4.2-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximal recommended \nhuman dose (MRHD) of 6 mg/day. Increased incidence of retinal degeneration/atrophy was observed \nin albino rats in the 2-year study at clinically relevant exposures. \n \nPhospholipidosis was observed in the lungs of rats, dogs, and mice (with or without inflammation) and \nin the adrenal gland cortex of dogs at clinically relevant exposures. Inflammation was observed in the \nlungs of dogs dosed for 1 year with a NOAEL at AUC exposures 2.7 (males) and 1.7 (females) times \nthe clinical exposure at the MRHD. No inflammation was observed at the end of 2-month drug-free \nperiod at an exposure 4.2 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD; however, inflammation was still \npresent at higher doses. \n \nHypertrophy of the adrenal gland cortex was observed at 4.1 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD \nin rats (females only) and at clinically relevant total cariprazine plasma concentrations in mice. In \ndogs, reversible hypertrophy/hyperplasia and vacuolation/vesiculation of the adrenal gland cortex \nwere observed with a NOAEL 4.2 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD. \n \nIn female rats, lower fertility and conception indices were observed at clinically relevant exposures \nbased on mg/m2 body surface area. No effects on male fertility were noted at exposures up to 4.8 times \nthe clinical exposure at the MRHD. \n \nAdministration of cariprazine to rats during the period of organogenesis caused malformations, lower \npup survival, and developmental delays at drug exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD \nof 6 mg/day. In rabbits, cariprazine caused maternal toxicity, but no foetal toxicity at exposures \n5.8 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD. \n \nAdministration of cariprazine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, throughout \npregnancy and lactation at clinically relevant exposures decreased postnatal survival, birth weight, and \npost-weaning body weight of first generation pups. In addition, pale, cold bodies and developmental \ndelays (renal papillae not developed/underdeveloped and decreased auditory startle response in males) \nwere observed in the absence of maternal toxicity. Reproductive performance of the first generation \npups was unaffected; however, second generation pups also had similar clinical signs and lower body \nweight. \n\n\n\n \n17 \n\n \nCariprazine and its metabolites were excreted in milk of rats during lactation. \n \n \n6.

What Reagila is and what it is used for \n \nReagila contains the active substance cariprazine and belongs to a group of medicines called \nantipsychotics. It is used to treat adults with schizophrenia. \nSchizophrenia is a disease characterised by symptoms such as hearing, seeing or sensing things which \nare not there (hallucination), suspiciousness, mistaken beliefs, incoherent speech and behaviour and \nemotional flatness. People with this condition may also feel depressed, guilty, anxious, tense, or not \nbeing able to start or keep up planned activities, unwillingness to speak, lack of emotional response to \na situation that would normally stimulate feelings in others. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Reagila \n \nDo not take Reagila: \n- if you are allergic to cariprazine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are taking medicines used to treat: \n\n- hepatitis caused by the hepatitis C virus (medicines containing boceprevir and telaprevir) \n- bacterial infections (medicines containing clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin \n\nand nafcillin) \n- tuberculosis (medicines containing rifampicin) \n- HIV infections (medicines containing cobicistat, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, \n\nsaquinavir, efavirenz and etravirine) \n- fungal infections (medicines containing itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and \n\n\n\n \n41 \n\nfluconazole) \n- Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an excess of cortisol (medicines \n\ncontaining ketoconazole) \n- depression (herbal therapy containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) and \n\nmedicines containing nefazodone) \n- epilepsy and seizures (medicines containing carbamazepine, phenobarbital and \n\nphenytoin) \n- heart disease (medicines containing diltiazem and verapamil) \n- sleepiness (medicines containing modafinil) \n- high blood pressure in the lungs (medicines containing bosentan). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTell your doctor immediately: \n- if you are having any thoughts or feelings about hurting yourself or to commit suicide. Suicidal \n\nthoughts and behaviours are more likely at the beginning of the treatment. \n- if you experience a combination of fever, sweating, faster breathing, muscle stiffness and \n\ndrowsiness or sleepiness (may be signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome). \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Reagila, or during treatment if you have: \n- ever experienced or start to experience restlessness and inability to sit still. These symptoms \n\nmay occur early during treatment with Reagila. Tell your doctor if this happens. \n- ever experienced or start to experience abnormal, involuntary movements, most commonly of \n\nthe tongue or face. Tell your doctor if this happens. \n- visual impairment. Your doctor will advise you to visit an ophthalmologist. \n- irregular heart beat or if someone else in your family has a history of irregular heart beat \n\n(including so called QT prolongation seen with ECG monitoring), and tell your doctor if you are \ntaking other medicines, because they might cause or worsen this ECG change. \n\n- high or low blood pressure, cardiovascular disease. Your doctor will need to check your blood \npressure regularly. \n\n- dizziness on standing up due to a drop in your blood pressure, which may cause fainting \n- a history of blood clots, or if someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as \n\nmedicines for schizophrenia have been associated with formation of blood clots \n- a history of stroke, especially if you are elderly or know that you have other risk factors for \n\nstroke. Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any signs of a stroke. \n- dementia (loss of memory and other mental abilities) especially if you are elderly \n- Parkinson’s disease \n- if you have diabetes or risk factors for diabetes (e.g. obesity, or someone else in your family has \n\ndiabetes). Your doctor will need to check your blood sugar regularly since it may be increased \nby Reagila. Signs of high blood sugar level are excessive thirst, passing of large amounts of \nurine, increase in appetite and feeling weak. \n\n- a history of seizures (fits) or epilepsy. \n \nWeigth increase \nReagila may cause significant weight increase which may affect your health. Your doctor will \ntherefore check your weight regularly. \n \nContraception \nWomen of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking Reagila and for \nat least 10 weeks after stopping treatment. If you are using hormonal contraceptives a so-called barrier \nmethod (e.g.condom or diaphragma) should also be used. (See section “Pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding”). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data \nin these patients. \n \nOther medicines and Reagila \n\n\n\n \n42 \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. You cannot take certain medicines together with Reagila (see section “Do not take \nReagila”). \n \nTaking Reagila together with some medicines may require a dose adjustment of Reagila or the other \nmedicine. These are medicines used to treat heart diseases containing digoxin, blood thinners \ncontaining dabigatran, or medicines affecting your mental functions. \nIf you are using hormonal contraceptives a so-called barrier method should also be used (see section \n“Pregnancy and breast-feeding” below). \n \nReagila with food, drink and alcohol \nYou should not drink grapefruit juice during treatment with Reagila. \nAlcohol should be avoided when taking Reagila. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during Reagila treatment. Even \nafter treatment is stopped, contraception must be used for at least 10 weeks after your last dose of \nReagila. This is because the medicine will stay in your body for some time after the last dose was \ntaken. If you are using hormonal contraceptives a so-called barrier method(e.g. condom or diaphragm) \nshould also be used. Ask your doctor about appropriate choices of contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nDo not take this medicine during pregnancy unless your doctor has told you to do so. \n \nIf your doctor decides that you should take this medicine during pregnancy, your doctor will monitor \nyour baby closely after birth. This is because the following symptoms may occur in newborn babies of \nmothers who have used this medicine in the last trimester (last three months) of their pregnancy: \n- shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and \n\ndifficulty in feeding. \nIf your baby develops any of these symptoms you should contact your doctor. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDo not breast-feed if you are taking Reagila because a risk for the baby cannot be excluded. Contact \nyour doctor for advice.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nThere is a minor or moderate risk that the medicine could affect the ability to drive and use machines. \nDrowsiness, dizziness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see section \n4). Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know that this medicine does not affect you in \na negative way. \n \nReagila 3 mg, 4.5 mg, 6 mg hard capsules contain Allura red AC (E129). \nAllura red AC is a coloring agent, which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n3. How to take Reagila \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 1.5 mg once a day by mouth. Thereafter, the dose may be slowly \nadjusted by your doctor, in steps of 1.5 mg, depending on how the treatment works for you. \n\n\n\n \n43 \n\nThe maximum dose should not exceed 6 mg once a day. \n \nTake Reagila at the same time each day with or without food. \n \nIf you were taking another medicine to treat schizophrenia before starting Reagila, your doctor will \ndecide whether to stop the other medicine gradually or immediately and how to adjust the dose of \nReagila. Your doctor will also inform you how to act if you switch from Reagila to another medicine. \n \nPatients with kidney or liver problems \nIf you have serious kidney or liver problems Reagila may not be appropriate for you. Talk to your \ndoctor. \n \nElderly patients \nYour doctor will carefully select the appropriate dose for your needs. \nReagila should not be used by elderly patients with dementia (loss of memory). \n \nIf you take more Reagila than you should \nIf you have taken more Reagila than your doctor has recommended or if, for example, a child has \ntaken it by mistake, contact your doctor or go to the nearest hospital right away and take the pack of \nthe medicine with you. You may experience dizziness from low blood pressure, or have abnormal \nheartbeats, you may feel sleepy, tired, or have abnormal body movements and find it difficult to stand \nor walk. \n \nIf you forget to take Reagila \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your \nnext dose, skip the missed dose and continue as usual. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \nIf you miss two or more doses, contact your doctor. \n \nIf you stop taking Reagila \nIf you stop taking this medicine you will lose the effects of the medicine. Even if you feel better, do \nnot alter or stop your daily dose of Reagila unless told to do so by your doctor as your symptoms may \nreturn. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4.
