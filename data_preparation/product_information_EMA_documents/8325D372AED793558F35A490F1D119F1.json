PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe.  \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza caused by A (H1N1v) 2009 virus (see section 4.4). \nFocetria should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe dose recommendations take into account the safety and immunogenicity data from clinical studies \nin healthy subjects.  \n \nPosology \n \nAdults (18-60 years):  \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose.  \n \nElderly (>60 years): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.  \nPaediatric population \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 3-17 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient. If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three \nweeks between the first and second dose.  \n \nChildren aged 6 months to 35 months: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nThere is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.5 ml administered after an interval of three \nweeks. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months: \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Focetria, should complete the vaccination \ncourse with Focetria H1N1v (see section 4.4). \nThe use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) of this vaccine. \n \nSee section 4.4 for special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by \nA/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients and to residues (eggs and \nchicken protein, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunisation should be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \nFocetria should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \nThere are no data with Focetria using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \nCases of convulsion with and without fever have been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria. \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in \nsubjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from \nepilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience \nconvulsion. (See section 4.8). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the event that a second dose is to be administered it should be noted that there are no safety, \nimmunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Focetria with other H1N1v vaccines. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFocetria H1N1v may be co-administered with a non adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. Data on \nco-administration of Focetria H1N1v with a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza subunit vaccine in \nhealthy adults aged 18-60 years of age did not suggest any interference in the immune response to \nFocetria. The immune response to the seasonal antigens was satisfactory.  \nCo-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to \nadministration of Focetria alone.  \nThe same study demonstrated that previous administration of adjuvanted or unadjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines to adults and elderly does not interfere with the immune response to Focetria. \nTherefore the data indicate that Focetria may be co-administered with non adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Focetria with other vaccines. \nIf co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety data are available in pregnant women exposed to Focetria in particular during second and third \ntrimesters. Postmarketing spontaneously reported adverse events, an interventional study and large \nobservational studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy.  \nFurther, data from vaccinations with seasonal interpandemic inactivated trivalent vaccines in pregnant \nwomen do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine. \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Focetria vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nFocetria may be administered to lactating women. \n \nFertility \nAn animal study with H5N1 mock-up vaccine did not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \nVery common (1/10),  \nCommon (1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100),  \nRare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000),  \nVery rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \nAdult and Elderly  \n \nIn a clinical trial 131 adults and 123 elderly were exposed to two doses of the 7.5 µg Focetria. \nThe safety profile of Focetria was similar to that of the H5N1 mock up vaccines. Most of the reactions \nwere mild in nature and of short duration. The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects \nover 60 years of age was generally lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population. \n \nVery common: pain, induration and erythema, myalgia, headache, sweating, malaise and fatigue  \n \nIn clinical trials with different formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1) approximately 3400 subjects \nwere exposed to the mock-up vaccines.  \nMost of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced \nby conventional seasonal influenza vaccines. It is widely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to \nincreased immunogenicity is associated with a slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly \nmild pain) compared with conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions \nafter the second vaccination compared with the first.  \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine are listed below.  \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to \nthe 18-60 years old population. \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nRare: convulsions \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating \nUncommon: urticaria \nRare: eye swelling \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nVery common: myalgia \nCommon: arthralgia  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site \nredness, fatigue, malaise and shivering \nCommon: injection site ecchymosis and fever \nUncommon: influenza like illness \nRare: anaphylaxis \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\nThe common reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age \n \nClinical trials with Focetria H1N1v \nSafety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents suggest a comparable safety \nprofile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation.  \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 87 children 3-8 years old and 95 children \nand adolescents 9-17 years old receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported as follows: \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N=87 N=85 \nAny adverse reaction 67% 61% \nLocal 56% 49% \nSystemic 32% 31% \nFever ≥ 38°C to 38.9°C 3%  1%  \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 13% 15% \nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N=95 N=94 \nAny adverse reaction 67% 55% \nLocal 60% 49% \nSystemic 38% 26% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C 2% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 0% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 11% 9% \n\n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 80 infants 6-11 months old \nand 82 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported as follows:  \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N=80 N=75 \nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44% 29% \nSystemic 69% 55% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  9%  6%  \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 2% 4% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 29% 28% \nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N=82 N=81 \nAny adverse reaction 70% 70% \nLocal 50% 48% \nSystemic 55% 44% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  10%  11%  \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 4% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21% 22% \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 7\n\nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 233 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea and change in eating habits. \nInduration was a common reaction in toddlers but was less common in infants. \n \n Post-marketing surveillance \n \nFocetria H1N1v \n \nIn addition to the adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials, the following have been reported \nduring post-marketing experience with Focetria H1N1v: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nLymphadenopathy. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPalpitation, tachycardia. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia. \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nMuscular weakness, pain in extremities. \n \nRespiratory disorders \nCough. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash; angioedema. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \n \nNervous system disorders \nHeadache, dizziness, somnolence, syncope.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1v) 2009 virus (see section 4.4). \nFocetria should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe dose recommendations take into account the safety and immunogenicity data from clinical studies \nin healthy subjects.  \n \nPosology \n \nAdults (18-60 years): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 14\n\nElderly (>60 years): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 3-17 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose.  \n \nChildren aged 6 months to 35 months: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nThere is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.5 ml administered after an interval of three \nweeks. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months: \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Focetria, should complete the vaccination \ncourse with Focetria H1N1v (see section 4.4). \nThe use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) of this vaccine. \n \nSee section 4.4. for special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by \nA/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to \nresidues (eggs and chicken protein, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunisation should be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 15\n\nFocetria should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \nThere are no data with Focetria using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nCases of convulsion with and without fever have been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria. \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in subjects \nwith a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from epilepsy and \nthe physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience convulsion. \n(See section 4.8). \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the event that a second dose is to be administered it should be noted that there are no safety, \nimmunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Focetria with other H1N1v vaccines. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFocetria H1N1v may be co-administered with a non adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. Data on \nco-administration of Focetria H1N1v with a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza subunit vaccine in \nhealthy adults aged 18-60 years of age did not suggest any interference in the immune response to \nFocetria. The immune response to the seasonal antigens was satisfactory.  \n \nCo-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to \nadministration of Focetria alone. \nThe same study demonstrated that previous administration of adjuvanted or unadjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines to adults and elderly does not interfere with the immune response to Focetria. \nTherefore the data indicate that Focetria may be co-administered with non adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Focetria with other vaccines.  \nIf co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate \nlimbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1(HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1 have been observed. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory \nfalse-positive results may due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety data are available in pregnant women exposed to Focetria in particular during second and third \ntrimesters. Postmarketing spontaneously reported adverse events, an interventional study and large \nobservational studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy.  \nFurther, data from vaccinations with seasonal interpandemic inactivated trivalent vaccines in pregnant \nwomen do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine. \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Focetria vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nFocetria may be administered to lactacting women. \n \nFertility \nAn animal study with H5N1 mock-up vaccine did not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 16\n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \nVery common (1/10),  \nCommon (1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100),  \nRare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000),  \nVery rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \nAdults and elderly \n \nIn clinical trial 131 adults and 123 elderly were exposed to two doses of the 7.5 µg Focetria. \nThe safety profile of Focetria was similar to that of the H5N1 mock up vaccines. Most of the reactions \nwere mild in nature and of short duration. The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects \nover 60 years of age was generally lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population. \n \nVery common: pain, induration and erythema, myalgia, headache, sweating, malaise and fatigue  \n \nIn clinical trials with different formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1) approximately 3400 subjects \nwere exposed to the candidate vaccine.  \nMost of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced \nby conventional seasonal influenza vaccines. It is widely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to \nincreased immunogenicity is associated with a slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly \nmild pain) compared with conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions \nafter the second vaccination compared with the first.  \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine are listed below.  \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to \nthe 18-60 years old population. \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nRare: convulsions \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating \nUncommon: urticaria \nRare: eye swelling \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nVery common: myalgia \nCommon: arthralgia  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 17\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site \nredness, fatigue, malaise and shivering \n \nCommon: injection site ecchymosis and fever \nUncommon: influenza like illness \nRare: anaphylaxis \n \nThe common reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age \n \nClinical trials with Focetria H1N1v \nSafety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents suggest a comparable safety \nprofile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation.  \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 87 children 3-8 years old and 95 children \nand adolescents 9-17 years old, receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported as follows:  \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N=87 N=85 \nAny adverse reaction 67% 61% \nLocal 56% 49% \nSystemic 32% 31% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C 3% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 13% 15% \nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N=95 N=94 \nAny adverse reaction 67% 55% \nLocal 60% 49% \nSystemic 38% 26% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C 2% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 0% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 11% 9% \n\n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n au\nth\n\nor\nise\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 18\n\nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 80 infants 6-11 months old \nand 82 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported as follows:  \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N=80 N=75 \nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44% 29% \nSystemic 69% 55% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  9%  6%  \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 2% 4% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 29% 28% \nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N=82 N=81 \nAny adverse reaction 70% 70% \nLocal 50% 48% \nSystemic 55% 44% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  10%  11%  \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 4% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21% 22% \n\n \nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 233 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea and change in eating habits. \nInduration was a common reaction in toddlers but was less common in infants. \n \n Post-marketing surveillance \n \nFocetria H1N1v \n \nIn addition to the adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials, the following have been reported \nduring post-marketing experience with Focetria H1N1v: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nLymphadenopathy. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPalpitation, tachycardia. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia. \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nMuscular weakness, pain in extremities. \n \nRespiratory disorders \nCough. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash; angioedema. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 19\n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache, dizziness, somnolence, syncope.

What FOCETRIA is and what it is used for \n \nFocetria is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu) caused by A(H1N1v) 2009 virus. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will produce \nits own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredient in the vaccine can cause flu. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive FOCETRIA \n \nDo not receive Focetria: \n \n if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of \n\nFocetria (these are listed at the end of the leaflet) or to any of the substances that may be present \nin trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, kanamycin and \nneomycin sulphate (antibiotics) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Signs of an allergic \nreaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Focetria \n \nTake special care with Focetria: \n if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to thiomersal (only for the multidose vial presentation), \nto egg and, chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate \n(antibiotics) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). (see section 6. Further information). \n\n \n if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could \nstill be vaccinated with Focetria, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 37\n\n if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with Focetria the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the \ndoctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Focetria. \n\n \nThe physician should inform you about the possibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you \nhave had previous history of epilepsy. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nOther medicines and Focetria \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescriptionor have recently been given any other vaccine.  \nFocetria can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, with injections \nmade into separate limbs. \n \nThere is no information on administration of the vaccine Focetria with any other vaccines. However, if \nthis cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should \nbe aware that the side effects may be more intense.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant. You should \ndiscuss with your doctor whether you should receive Focetria taking into consideration official \nrecommendation based on post-marketing reported adverse events during second and third trimesters \nof pregnancy.  \nThe vaccine may be used during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome effects mentioned under section 4. “Possible side effects” may affect the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \nFocetria contains \n \nThis vaccine in a multi-dose vial contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may \nexperience an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. \nThis medicinal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) \nper 0.5 ml dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium free. \n \n \n3. How FOCETRIA is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations.  \nThe vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).  \n \nAdults  \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. \nClinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \nElderly:  \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine and a second dose of 0.5 ml at least three weeks later. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 38\n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nChildren and adolescents 3-17 years of age: \nYou or your child will receive one dose of 0.5 ml vaccine. \nAvailable clinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \nChildren 6 months to 35 months: \nYou or your child will receive one dose of 0.5 ml vaccine.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months of age: \nVaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. \n \nWhen Focetria is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Focetria (and not another vaccine \nagainst H1N1v) be given for the complete vaccination course. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Focetria can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nIn the clinical studies with the vaccine, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. \nThe side-effects are generally similar to those related to the seasonal flu vaccine. \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Focetria in clinical studies in adults, including the elderly: \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10): \nPain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, injection site swelling, pain at the \nsite of injection, aching muscles, headache, sweating, fatigue, generally feeling unwell and shivering \n \nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100): \nBruising of the skin at the injection site, fever and nausea \n \nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000): \nFlu like symptoms \n \nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000): \nConvulsion, eye swelling and anaphylaxis \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT \nYOUR DOCTOR. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies in children \n \nA clinical study was conducted with the same vaccine in children. General side effects reported very \ncommonly in the 6 months-35 months of age group per dose were irritability, unusual crying, \nsleepiness, diarrhoea and change in eating habits. Among the adolescents the very common events \nwere: sweating, nausea and chills. Very commonly reported reactions in both children and adolescents \nwere pain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, generally feeling unwell, \nmuscle ache, headache and fatigue. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 39\n\nOther side effects \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with Focetria. \n \nGeneralised skin reactions including itching, urticaria (hives), rash or swelling of the skin and mucous \nmembranes. \nDisorders of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \nHeadache, dizziness, drowsiness, fainting. \nNeurological disorders such as severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves, tingling, \nfits, and neuritis (inflammation of nerves).  \nSwollen lymph nodes, palpitations, weakness, pain in the extremities and cough. \nAllergic reactions possibly with shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the throat, or leading to a \ndangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to shock. Doctors are aware of \nthis possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nData in children and adolescents suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second dose of \nthe vaccine, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nIn addition, the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with \nadjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu. These side effects \nmay occur with Focetria. \n \nRare: \nLow blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising.  \n \nVery rare: \nVasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney \nproblems), exudative erythema multiforme. \nNeurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system),  \nand a type of paralysis known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome.  \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet.  \n \n \n5. How to store FOCETRIA \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use Focetria after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the label. The expiry date \nrefers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nDo not freeze.  \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 40\n\n6.

Therefore, the relevant SmPC wording currently stating the limited \navailability of clinical data in pregnant women, is recommended to be changed to reflect the newly \navailable information. \nTherefore, in view of available data regarding the use of Focetria during pregnancy, the PRAC \nconsidered that changes to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the \nscientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for Focetria, the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance influenza vaccine \nh1n1v (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) is favourable subject to the proposed changes to \nthe product information. \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
