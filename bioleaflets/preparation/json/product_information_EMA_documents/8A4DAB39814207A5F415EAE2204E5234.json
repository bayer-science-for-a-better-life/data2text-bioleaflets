NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nAngiox 250 mg powder for concentrate for solution for injection or infusion.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach vial contains 250 mg bivalirudin.   \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution 1 ml contains 50 mg bivalirudin.   \n\nAfter dilution 1 ml contains 5 mg bivalirudin.   \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for injection or infusion (powder for concentrate).   \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white lyophilised powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nAngiox is indicated as an anticoagulant in adult patients undergoing percutaneous coronary \n\nintervention (PCI), including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) \n\nundergoing primary PCI. \n\n \n\nAngiox is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment \n\nelevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) planned for urgent or early intervention. \n\n \n\nAngiox should be administered with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nAngiox should be administered by a physician experienced in either acute coronary care or in coronary \n\nintervention procedures.   \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nPatients undergoing PCI, including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\n(STEMI) undergoing primary PCI \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of bivalirudin for patients undergoing PCI is an intravenous bolus of \n\n0.75 mg/kg body weight followed immediately by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1.75 mg/kg \n\nbody weight/hour for at least the duration of the procedure. The infusion of 1.75 mg/kg body \n\nweight/hour may be continued for up to 4 hours post-PCI and at a reduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg body \n\nweight/hour for an additional 4 – 12 hours as clinically necessary. In STEMI patients the infusion of \n\n1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour should be continued for up to 4 hours post-PCI and continued at a \n\nreduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight/hour for an additional 4 – 12 hours as clinically necessary \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients should be carefully monitored following primary PCI for signs and symptoms consistent with \n\nmyocardial ischaemia.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\n \n\nPatients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevated myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of bivalirudin for medically managed patients with acute coronary \n\nsyndrome (ACS) is an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h. \n\nPatients who are to be medically managed may continue the infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for up to 72 \n\nhours.  If the medically managed patient proceeds to PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of \n\nbivalirudin should be administered before the procedure and the infusion increased to 1.75 mg/kg/h for \n\nthe duration of the procedure. Following PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg/kg/h may be \n\nresumed for 4 to 12 hours as clinically necessary. \n\n \n\nFor patients who proceed to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery off pump, the intravenous \n\ninfusion of bivalirudin should be continued until the time of surgery. Just prior to surgery, a 0.5 mg/kg \n\nbolus dose should be administered followed by a 1.75 mg/kg/h intravenous infusion for the duration of \n\nthe surgery. \n\n \n\nFor patients who proceed to CABG surgery on pump, the intravenous infusion of bivalirudin should be \n\ncontinued until 1 hour prior to surgery after which the infusion should be discontinued and the patient \n\ntreated with unfractionated heparin (UFH).   \n\n \n\nTo ensure appropriate administration of bivalirudin, the completely dissolved, reconstituted and \n\ndiluted product should be thoroughly mixed prior to administration (see section 6.6). The bolus dose \n\nshould be administered by a rapid intravenous push to ensure that the entire bolus reaches the patient \n\nbefore the start of the procedure.  \n\n \n\nIntravenous infusion lines should be primed with bivalirudin to ensure continuity of drug infusion after \n\ndelivery of the bolus. \n\n \n\nThe infusion dose should be initiated immediately after the bolus dose is administered, ensuring \n\ndelivery to the patient prior to the procedure, and continued uninterrupted for the duration of the \n\nprocedure. The safety and efficacy of a bolus dose of bivalirudin without the subsequent infusion has \n\nnot been evaluated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.  \n\n \n\nAn increase in the activated clotting time (ACT) may be used as an indication that a patient has \n\nreceived bivalirudin.  \n\n \n\nACT values 5 minutes after bivalirudin bolus average 365 +/- 100 seconds. If the 5-minute ACT is less \n\nthan 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg/kg should be administered.  \n\n \n\nOnce the ACT value is greater than 225 seconds, no further monitoring is required provided the \n\n1.75 mg/kg/h infusion dose is properly administered.  \n\n \n\nWhere insufficient ACT increase is observed, the possibility of medication error should be considered, \n\nfor example inadequate mixing of Angiox or intravenous equipment failures.  \n\n \n\nThe arterial sheath can be removed 2 hours after discontinuation of the bivalirudin infusion without \n\nanticoagulation monitoring. \n\n \n\nUse with other anticoagulant therapy \n\nIn STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, standard pre-hospital adjunctive therapy should include \n\nclopidogrel and may include the early administration of UFH (See section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nPatients can be started on Angiox 30 minutes after discontinuation of unfractionated heparin given \n\nintravenously, or 8 hours after discontinuation of low molecular weight heparin given subcutaneously.  \n\n \n\nAngiox can be used in conjunction with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. For further information regarding the \n\nuse of bivalirudin with or without a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, please see section 5.1.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\nRenal insufficiency \n\nAngiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR<30 ml/min) and also in \n\ndialysis-dependent patients (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency, the ACS dose (0.1 mg/kg bolus/0.25 mg/kg/h \n\ninfusion) should not be adjusted. \n\n \n\nPatients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min) undergoing PCI (whether being treated \n\nwith bivalirudin for ACS or not) should receive a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg/kg/h. The bolus dose \n\nshould not be changed from the posology described under ACS or PCI above. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment should be carefully monitored for clinical signs of bleeding during PCI, \n\nas clearance of bivalirudin is reduced in these patients (see section 5.2) \n\n \n\nIf the 5-minute ACT is less than 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg/kg should be \n\nadministered and the ACT re-checked 5 minutes after the administration of the second bolus dose. \n\n \n\nWhere insufficient ACT increase is observed, the possibility of medication error should be considered, \n\nfor example inadequate mixing of Angiox or intravenous equipment failures. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that hepatic metabolism of bivalirudin \n\nis limited, therefore the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin have not been specifically studied in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nIncreased awareness due to high bleeding risk should be exercised in the elderly because of \n\nage-related decrease in renal function. Dose adjustments for this age group should be on the basis of \n\nrenal function. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nThere is currently no indication for the use of Angiox in children less than 18 years old and no \n\nrecommendation on a posology can be made.  Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 \n\nand 5.2. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nAngiox is intended for intravenous use. \n\n \n\nAngiox should be initially reconstituted to give a solution of 50 mg/ml bivalirudin. Reconstituted \n\nmaterial should then be further diluted in a total volume of 50 ml to give a solution of 5 mg/ml \n\nbivalirudin. \n\n \n\nReconstituted and diluted product should be thoroughly mixed prior to administration. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nAngiox is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n \n\n a known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, \nor to hirudins \n\n active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding because of haemostasis disorders and/or \nirreversible coagulation disorders \n\n severe uncontrolled hypertension \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\n subacute bacterial endocarditis \n\n severe renal impairment (GFR<30 ml/min) and in dialysis-dependent patients \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAngiox is not intended for intramuscular use. Do not administer intramuscularly. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage  \n\n \n\nPatients must be observed carefully for symptoms and signs of bleeding during treatment particularly \n\nif bivalirudin is combined with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5). Although most bleeding \n\nassociated with bivalirudin occurs at the site of arterial puncture in patients undergoing PCI, \n\nhaemorrhage can occur at any site during therapy. Unexplained decreases in haematocrit, haemoglobin \n\nor blood pressure may indicate haemorrhage. Treatment should be stopped if bleeding is observed or \n\nsuspected. \n\n \n\nThere is no known antidote to bivalirudin but its effect wears off quickly (T½ is 25 ± 12 minutes). \n\n \n\nProlonged post PCI infusions of bivalirudin at recommended doses have not been associated with an \n\nincreased rate of bleeding (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nCo-administration with platelet inhibitors or anti-coagulants  \n\n \n\nCombined use of anti-coagulant medicinal products can be expected to increase the risk of bleeding \n\n(see section 4.5). When bivalirudin is combined with a platelet inhibitor or an anti-coagulant medicine, \n\nclinical and biological parameters of haemostasis should be regularly monitored. \n\n \n\nIn patients taking warfarin who are treated with bivalirudin, International Normalised Ratio (INR) \n\nmonitoring should be considered to ensure that it returns to pre-treatment levels following \n\ndiscontinuation of bivalirudin treatment. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity  \n\n \n\nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions were reported uncommonly (≥1/1,000 to ≤1/100) in clinical \n\ntrials. Necessary preparations should be made to deal with this. Patients should be informed of the \n\nearly signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of chest, \n\nwheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. In the case of shock, the current medical standards for shock \n\ntreatment should be applied. Anaphylaxis, including anaphylactic shock with fatal outcome has been \n\nreported very rarely (≤1/10,000) in post-marketing experience (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nTreatment-emergent positive bivalirudin antibodies are rare and have not been associated with clinical \n\nevidence of allergic or anaphylactic reactions. Caution should be exercised in patients previously \n\ntreated with lepirudin who had developed lepirudin antibodies. \n\n \n\nAcute stent thrombosis \n\n \n\nAcute stent thrombosis (<24 hours) has been observed in patients with STEMI undergoing primary \n\nPCI and has been managed by Target Vessel Revascularisation (TVR) (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The \n\nmajority of these cases were non-fatal. This increased risk of acute stent thrombosis was observed \n\nduring the first 4 hours following the end of the procedure among patients who either discontinued the \n\ninfusion of bivalirudin at the end of the procedure or received a continued infusion at the reduced dose \n\nof 0.25 mg/kg/h (see section 4.2). Patients should remain for at least 24 hours in a facility capable of \n\nmanaging ischaemic complications and should be carefully monitored following primary PCI for signs \n\nand symptoms consistent with myocardial ischaemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\nBrachytherapy \n\n \n\nIntra-procedural thrombus formation has been observed during gamma brachytherapy procedures with \n\nAngiox. \n\n \n\nAngiox should be used with caution during beta brachytherapy procedures. \n\n \n\nExcipient \n\n \n\nAngiox contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have been conducted with platelet inhibitors, including acetylsalicylic acid, \n\nticlopidine, clopidogrel, abciximab, eptifibatide, or tirofiban. The results do not suggest \n\npharmacodynamic interactions with these medicinal products. \n\n \n\nFrom the knowledge of their mechanism of action, combined use of anti-coagulant medicinal products \n\n(heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or antiplatelet agents) can be expected to increase the risk of \n\nbleeding. \n\n \n\nIn any case, when bivalirudin is combined with a platelet inhibitor or an anticoagulant, clinical and \n\nbiological parameters of haemostasis should be regularly monitored. \n\n \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited data from the use of bivalirudin in pregnant women. Animal studies are \n\ninsufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-\n\nnatal development (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\nAngiox should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \n\ntreatment with bivalirudin.  \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether bivalirudin is excreted in human milk. Angiox should be administered with \n\ncaution in breast-feeding mothers. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nAngiox has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\n The most frequent serious and fatal adverse reactions are major haemorrhage (access site and \nnon access-site bleeding, including intracranial haemorrhage) and hypersensitivity, including \n\nanaphylactic shock. Coronary artery thrombosis and coronary stent thrombosis with myocardial \n\ninfarction, and catheter thrombosis have each been reported rarely. Administration errors may \n\nlead to fatal thrombosis.  \n\n In patients receiving warfarin, INR is increased by administration of bivalirudin.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 7 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions for bivalirudin from HORIZONS, ACUITY, REPLACE-2 trials and post-marketing \n\nexperience are listed by system organ class in Table 1. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

The \n\nincidence of major and minor bleeding was significantly less in patients treated with bivalirudin versus \n\npatients treated with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The incidence of major bleeding is shown in \n\nTable 6. Major bleeding occurred most frequently at the sheath puncture site. The most frequent event \n\nwas a haematoma <5 cm at puncture site. \n\n \n\nIn the HORIZONS study, thrombocytopenia was reported in 26 (1. 6%) of bivalirudin-treated patients \n\nand in 67 (3.9%) of patients treated with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. All of these bivalirudin-\n\ntreated patients received concomitant acetylsalicylic acid, all but 1 received clopidogrel and 15 also \n\nreceived a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.  \n\n \n\nThe ACUITY Trial (Patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevated myocardial infarction \n\n(UA/NSTEMI)) \n\n \n\nThe following data are based on a clinical study of bivalirudin in 13,819 patients with ACS; 4,612 \n\nwere randomised to bivalirudin alone, 4,604 were randomised to bivalirudin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor \n\nand 4,603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. \n\nAdverse reactions were more frequent in females and in patients more than 65 years of age in both the \n\nbivalirudin and the heparin-treated comparator groups compared to male or younger patients. \n\n \n\nApproximately 23.3% of patients receiving bivalirudin experienced at least one adverse event and \n\n2.1% experienced an adverse reaction. Adverse event reactions for bivalirudin are listed by system \n\norgan class in Table 1. \n\n \n\nPlatelets, bleeding and clotting \n\n \n\nIn ACUITY, bleeding data were collected separately from adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nMajor bleeding was defined as any one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, \n\naccess site haemorrhage requiring radiological or surgical intervention, ≥5 cm diameter haematoma at \n\npuncture site, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥4 g/dl without an overt source of bleeding, \n\nreduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥3 g/dl with an overt source of bleeding, re-operation for \n\nbleeding or use of any blood product transfusion. Minor bleeding was defined as any observed \n\nbleeding event that did not meet the criteria as major. Minor bleeding occurred very commonly \n\n(1/10) and major bleeding occurred commonly (1/100 and <1/10).  \n\n \n\nMajor bleeding rates are shown in Table 6 for the IIT population and Table 7 for the per protocol \n\npopulation (patients receiving clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid). Both major and minor bleeds were \n\nsignificantly less frequent with bivalirudin alone than the heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor and \n\nbivalirudin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor groups. Similar reductions in bleeding were observed in patients \n\nwho were switched to bivalirudin from heparin-based therapies (N = 2,078). \n\n \n\nMajor bleeding occurred most frequently at the sheath puncture site. Other less frequently observed \n\nbleeding sites with greater than 0.1% (uncommon) bleeding included “other” puncture site, \n\nretroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia was reported in 10 bivalirudin-treated patients participating in the ACUITY study \n\n(0.1%). The majority of these patients received concomitant acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel, and 6 \n\nout of the 10 patients also received a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

Adverse events were more frequent in females \n\nand in patients more than 65 years of age in both the bivalirudin and the heparin-treated comparator \n\ngroups compared to male or younger patients. \n\n \n\nApproximately 30% of patients receiving bivalirudin experienced at least one adverse event and 3% \n\nexperienced an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions for bivalirudin are listed by system organ class in \n\nTable 1. \n\n \n\nPlatelets, bleeding and clotting \n\n \n\nIn REPLACE-2, bleeding data were collected separately from adverse events. Major bleeding rates for \n\nthe intent-to-treat trial population are shown in Table 6. \n\n \n\nMajor bleeding was defined as the occurrence of any of the following: intracranial haemorrhage, \n\nretroperitoneal haemorrhage, blood loss leading to a transfusion of at least two units of whole blood or \n\npacked red blood cells, or bleeding resulting in a haemoglobin drop of more than 3 g/dl, or a fall in \n\nhaemoglobin greater than 4 g/dl (or 12% of haematocrit) with no bleeding site identified. Minor \n\nhaemorrhage was defined as any observed bleeding event that did not meet the criteria for a major \n\nhaemorrhage. Minor bleeding occurred very commonly (1/10) and major bleeding occurred \n\ncommonly (1/100 and <1/10).  \n\n \n\nBoth minor and major bleeds were significantly less frequent with bivalirudin than the heparin plus \n\nGP IIb/IIIa inhibitor comparator group. Major bleeding occurred most frequently at the sheath \n\npuncture site. Other less frequently observed bleeding sites with greater than 0.1% (uncommon) \n\nbleeding included “other” puncture site, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat. \n\n \n\nIn REPLACE-2 thrombocytopenia occurred in 20 bivalirudin-treated patients (0.7%). The majority of \n\nthese patients received concomitant acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel, and 10 out of 20 patients also \n\nreceived a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

Serious adverse reactions were reported more frequently in the heparin plus \n\nGP IIb/IIIa group than the bivalirudin treated group.  \n\n \n\nA total of 55.1% of patients receiving bivalirudin experienced at least one adverse event and 8.7% \n\nexperienced an adverse drug reaction. Adverse drug reactions for bivalirudin are listed by system \n\norgan class in Table 1.The incidence of stent thrombosis within the first 24 hours was 1.5% in patients \n\nreceiving bivalirudin versus 0.3% in patients receiving UFH plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (p=0.0002). \n\nTwo deaths occurred after acute stent thrombosis, 1 in each arm of the study. The incidence of stent \n\nthrombosis between 24 hours and 30 days was 1. 2% in patients receiving bivalirudin versus 1.9% in \n\npatients receiving UFH plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (p=0.1553). A total of 17 deaths occurred after \n\nsubacute stent thrombosis, 3 in the bivalirudin arm and 14 in the UFH plus GP IIb/IIIa arm. There was \n\nno statistically significant difference in the rates of stent thrombosis between treatment arms at \n\n30 days (p=0.3257) and 1 year (p=0.7754). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, Direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE06. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nAngiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombin inhibitor that binds both to the catalytic \n\nsite and the anion-binding exosite of fluid-phase and clot-bound thrombin. \n\n \n\nThrombin plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin \n\nmonomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-\n\nlinked framework that stabilises the thrombus. Thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting \n\nfurther thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. \n\nBivalirudin inhibits each of these thrombin effects. \n\n \n\nThe binding of bivalirudin to thrombin, and therefore its activity, is reversible as thrombin slowly \n\ncleaves the bivalirudin, Arg3-Pro4, bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site function. Thus, \n\nbivalirudin initially acts as a complete non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin, but transitions over time \n\nto become a competitive inhibitor enabling initially inhibited thrombin molecules to interact with other \n\nclotting substrates and to coagulation if required. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies have indicated that bivalirudin inhibits both soluble (free) and clot-bound thrombin. \n\nBivalirudin remains active and is not neutralised by products of the platelet release reaction.   \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies have also shown that bivalirudin prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time \n\n(aPTT) thrombin time (TT) and pro-thrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration-\n\ndependent manner and that bivalirudin does not induce a platelet aggregation response against sera \n\nfrom patients with a history of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia/Thrombosis Syndrome \n\n(HIT/HITTS). \n\n \n\nIn healthy volunteers and patients, bivalirudin exhibits dose- and concentration-dependent \n\nanticoagulant activity as evidenced as prolongation of the ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT. Intravenous \n\nadministration of bivalirudin produces measurable anticoagulation within minutes. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacodynamic effects of bivalirudin may be assessed using measures of anticoagulation \n\nincluding the ACT. The ACT value is positively correlated with the dose and plasma concentration of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 12 \n\nbivalirudin administered. Data from 366 patients indicates that the ACT is unaffected by concomitant \n\ntreatment with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.   \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies bivalirudin has been shown to provide adequate anticoagulation during PCI \n\nprocedures. \n\n \n\nThe HORIZONS Trial (Patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI)  \n\n \n\nThe HORIZONS trial was a prospective, dual arm, single blind, randomised, multi-centre trial to \n\nestablish the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin in patients with STEMI undergoing a primary PCI \n\nstrategy with stent implantation with either a slow release paclitaxel-eluding stent (TAXUS™) or an \n\notherwise identical uncoated bare metal stent (Express2™). A total of 3,602 patients were randomised \n\nto receive either bivalirudin (1,800 patients) or unfractionated heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor \n\n(1,802 patients).  All patients received acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel with twice as many patients \n\n(approximately 64%) receiving a 600mg loading dose of clopidogrel than a 300mg loading dose of \n\nclopidogrel.  Approximately 66% of patients were pre-treated with unfractionated heparin. \n\n \n\nThe dose of bivalirudin used in HORIZONS was the same as that used in the REPLACE-2 study \n\n(0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by a 1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour infusion). A total of 92.9% of patients \n\ntreated underwent primary PCI as their primary management strategy.  \n\n \n\nThe analysis and results for the HORIZONS trial at 30 days for the overall (ITT) population is shown \n\nin Table 2.Results at 1 year were consistent with results at 30 days. \n\n \n\nBleeding definitions and outcomes from the HORIZONS trial are shown in Table 6. \n\n \n\nTable 2.

ACUITY major bleeding was defined as any one of the following: intracranial, \n\nretroperitoneal, intraocular, access site haemorrhage requiring radiological or surgical intervention, \n\n≥5 cm diameter haematoma at puncture site, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥4 g/dl \n\nwithout an overt source of bleeding, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥3 g/dl with an overt \n\nsource of bleeding, re-operation for bleeding, use of any blood product transfusion. Major bleeding in \n\nthe HORIZONS study was also defined using the ACUITY scale. TIMI major bleeding was \n\ndefined as intracranial bleeding or a decrease in haemoglobin concentration ≥5 g/dl.  \n\n \n\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-thrombosis \n\nsyndrome (HIT/HITTS) \n\n \n\nClinical trials in a small number of patients have provided limited information about the use of Angiox \n\nin patients with HIT/HITTS. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\n In clinical study TMC-BIV-07-01, the pharmacodynamic response as measured by ACT was \n\nconsistent with adult studies. The ACT increased in all patients – from neonates to older children as \n\nwell as adults- with increasing bivalirudin concentrations. The ACT vs concentration data suggest a \n\ntrend for a lower concentration response curve for adults as compared to older children (6 years to \n\n< 16 years) and younger children (2 years to <6 years), and for older children compared to infants \n\n(31 days to <24 months) and neonates (birth to 30 days). Pharmacodynamic models indicated that this \n\neffect is due to a higher baseline ACT in neonates and infants than in older children. However, the \n\nmaximal ACT values for all groups (adults and all paediatric groups) converge at a similar level near \n\nan ACT of 400 seconds. The clinical utility of ACT in neonates and children should be considered \n\nwith caution considering their developmental haematological state. \n\nThrombotic (9/110, 8.2%) and major bleeding events (2/110, 1.8%) were observed in the study. Other \n\nfrequently reported adverse events were decreased pedal pulse, catheter site haemorrhage, abnormal \n\npulse, and nausea (8.2%, 7.3%, 6.4% and 5.5%, respectively). Five patients had a post-baseline nadir \n\nplatelet count of <150,000 cells/mm\n3\n, representing a ≥50% decrease in platelets from baseline. All 5 \n\nevents were associated with additional cardiac procedures employing heparin anticoagulation (n=3) or \n\nwith infections (n=2). A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, and an Exposure and \n\nAdverse Event Assessment Model based on the data from this study determined that in paediatric \n\npatients, use of the adult dosing with plasma levels similar to that achieved in adults was associated \n\nwith lower levels of thrombotic events with no impact on bleeding events (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin have been evaluated and found to be linear in patients \n\nundergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and in patients with ACS. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe bioavailability of bivalirudin for intravenous use is complete and immediate. The mean steady-\n\nstate concentration of bivalirudin following a constant intravenous infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/h is \n\n12.4 µg/ml. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 18 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nBivalirudin is rapidly distributed between plasma and extracellular fluid. The steady-state volume of \n\ndistribution is 0.1 l/kg. Bivalirudin does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red \n\nblood cells. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nAs a peptide, bivalirudin is expected to undergo catabolism to its constituent amino acids, with \n\nsubsequent recycling of the amino acid in the body pool. Bivalirudin is metabolized by proteases, \n\nincluding thrombin. The primary metabolite resulting from the cleavage of Arg3-Pro4 bond of the N-\n\nterminal sequence by thrombin is not active because of the loss of affinity to the catalytic active site of \n\nthrombin. About 20% of bivalirudin is excreted unchanged in the urine. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe concentration-time profile following intravenous administration is well described by a two-\n\ncompartment model. Elimination follows a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25  12 \n\nminutes in patients with normal renal function. The corresponding clearance is about \n\n3.4  0.5 ml/min/kg. \n\n \n\nHepatic Insufficiency \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of bivalirudin have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment but are \n\nnot expected to be altered because bivalirudin is not metabolized by liver enzymes such as cytochrome \n\nP-450 isozymes. \n\n \n\nRenal Insufficiency \n\n \n\nThe systemic clearance of bivalirudin decreases with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The clearance \n\nof bivalirudin is similar in patients with normal renal function and those with mild renal impairment. \n\nClearance is reduced by approximately 20% in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, and \n\n80% in dialysis-dependent patients (Table 8).  \n\n \n\nTable 8.

The approved adult weight-based intravenous bolus dose of 0.75 mg/kg \n\nfollowed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hour was studied and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic \n\nanalysis found a response similar to that of adults, although weight-normalized clearance (ml/min/kg) \n\nof bivalirudin was higher in neonates than in older children and decreased with increasing age.   \n\n \n\n5.3 Pre-clinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, or toxicity to reproduction. \n\n \n\nToxicity in animals upon repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at exposure levels of up \n\nto 10 times the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was limited to exaggerated pharmacological \n\neffects. Comparison of the single and repeated dose studies revealed that toxicity was related primarily \n\nto duration of exposure. All the undesirable effects, primary and secondary, resulting from excessive \n\npharmacological activity were reversible. Undesirable effects that resulted from prolonged \n\nphysiological stress in response to a non-homeostatic state of coagulation were not seen after short \n\nexposure comparable to that in clinical use, even at much higher doses.   \n\n \n\nBivalirudin is intended for short-term administration and therefore no data on the long-term \n\ncarcinogenic potential of bivalirudin are available. However, bivalirudin was not mutagenic or \n\nclastogenic in standard assays for such effects.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND \n\nEFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT   \n\n \n\n Risk Management Plan (RMP) \n \n\nThe MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the \n\nagreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent \n\nupdates of the RMP. \n\n \n\nAn updated RMP should be submitted: \n\n \n\n At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  \n\n Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new \ninformation being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile \n\nor as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being \n\nreached. \n\n \n\n Additional risk minimisation measures  \n \n\nIn order to ensure the correct use of Angiox and to avoid medication errors, the MAH shall ensure that \n\nall prescribers who are expected to prescribe/use Angiox are provided with training on dosing and \n\nadministration. Educational material includes a slide deck presentation, dosing cards as described in \n\nthe risk minimization measures in the RMP, and a copy of the SmPC. The educational materials will \n\nbe used in all member states for both initial training and re-education in the event of reports of bolus \n\nonly dosing without subsequent infusion. \n\n \n\nThe slide deck will contain the following key information:  \n\n  \n\n Approved dose in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): The licensed \nand approved dosing regimen of Angiox is an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of 0.75 mg/kg \n\nbody weight followed immediately by an intravenous infusion at 1.75 mg/kg/hour for at least \n\nthe duration of the PCI. \n\n Angiox must be administered as a bolus dose followed immediately by an intravenous infusion, \neven if a short PCI procedure is planned. Do not use without dilution. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 24 \n\n For patients undergoing PCI, bivalirudin MUST be administered initially as an intravenous \nbolus followed immediately by an infusion. This dosing regimen is required to achieve and \n\nmaintain the plasma concentration required for effective ischaemic protection during PCI. Based \n\non the short half-life of bivalirudin (25 minutes), failure to initiate an infusion following the \n\nAngiox bolus will result in a plasma concentration that is below the required level within \n\nminutes \n\n In the ImproveR registry bolus dosing (without subsequent infusion) was observed in EU \nclinical practice. This dosing pattern was associated with increased in-hospital ischaemic events \n\n(MACE). The safety and efficacy of a bolus without subsequent infusion dose of ANGIOX has \n\nnot been evaluated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned. \n\n Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) < 30 ml/min) and in dialysis-dependent patients. \n\n In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/ min) the infusion rate should be \nreduced to 1.4 mg/kg/h. The bolus dose remains 0.75 mg/kg (or 0.5 mg/kg in patients who \n\nproceed to PCI after receiving bivalirudin pre-cath lab (UA/NSTEMI)). \n\n \n\nThe dosing cards will contain the following key information: \n\n \n\n Angiox must be administered as a bolus dose followed immediately by an intravenous infusion, \neven if a short PCI procedure is planned.  \n\n Do not use bivalirudin without first diluting it. \n\n Tabulated information on dosing by body weight of patient. \n\n Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) < 30 ml/min) and in dialysis-dependent patients. \n\n In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/ min) the infusion rate should be \nreduced to 1.4 mg/kg/h. The bolus dose remains 0.75 mg/kg; or 0.5 mg/kg in patients who \n\nproceed to PCI after receiving bivalirudin pre-cath lab (UA/NSTEMI). \n\n Brief information on preparation and administration instructions. \n \n\nThe MAH shall agree on the dosing card together with a communication plan, with the National \n\nCompetent Authority in each Member State prior to distribution in the Member State. \n\n \n\nThe use of the Angiox dosing card is recommended as a quick reference guide. Healthcare providers \n\nare recommended to refer to the Angiox Summary of Product Characteristics for full information on \n\ndosing. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEX III \n\n \n\nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

WHAT ANGIOX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  \n\n \n\nAngiox contains a substance called bivalirudin which is an antithrombotic medicine. Antithrombotics \n\nare medicines which prevent the formation of blood clots (thrombosis).   \n\n \n\nAngiox is used to treat patients:  \n\n \n\n with chest pain due to heart disease (acute coronary syndromes - ACS) \n\n who are having surgery to treat blockages in their blood vessels (angioplasty and/or \n\npercutaneous coronary intervention - PCI). \n\n \n\n \n\n2. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU USE ANGIOX \n\n \n\nDo not use Angiox \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to bivalirudin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6) or hirudins (other blood thinning medicines). \n\n- if you have, or have recently had, any bleeding from your stomach, intestines, bladder or other \norgans, for example, if you have noticed abnormal blood in your stools or urine (except from \n\nmenstrual bleeding). \n\n- if you have, or have had, difficulty with your blood clotting (a low platelet count). \n- if you have severe high blood pressure. \n- if you have an infection of the heart tissue. \n- if you have severe kidney problems or if you need kidney dialysis. \n \n\nCheck with the doctor if you are unsure. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Angiox. \n\n \n\n if bleeding occurs (if this happens, treatment with Angiox will be stopped). Throughout your \ntreatment, the doctor will check you for any signs of bleeding. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 32 \n\n if you have been treated before with medicines similar to Angiox (e.g. lepirudin).   \n\n before the start of the injection or infusion, the doctor will tell you about the signs of allergic \nreaction. Such a reaction is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n if you are having radiation treatment in the vessels that supply blood to the heart (treatment \ncalled beta or gamma brachytherapy).  \n\n \n\nAfter being treated with Angiox for a cardiac event, you should stay in the hospital for at least 24 \n\nhours and you should be monitored for any symptoms or signs similar to the ones that remind you of \n\nyour cardiac event and resulted in your hospitalisation.   \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\n \n\n if you are a child (less than 18 years of age), this medicine is not appropriate for you. \n \n\nOther medicines and Angiox \n\n \n\ntell your doctor \n\n if you are taking, or have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n If you are taking blood thinners or medicines to prevent blood clots (anticoagulants or \nantithrombotics e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, acetylsalicylic acid, \n\nclopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor).  \n\n \n\nthese medicines may increase the risk of side effects such as bleeding when given at the same time as \n\nAngiox. Your warfarin blood test result (INR test) may be affected by Angiox. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nAngiox should not be used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary. Your doctor will decide \n\nwhether or not this treatment is appropriate for you. If you are breast-feeding, the doctor will decide \n\nwhether Angiox should be used. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nthe effects of this medicine are known to be short-term. Angiox is only given when a patient is in \n\nhospital. It is, therefore, unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n\n \n\nAngiox contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 23 mg of sodium per vial, which means that it is essentially “sodium-\n\nfree”. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.  HOW TO USE ANGIOX \n\n \n\nYour treatment with Angiox will be supervised by a doctor. The doctor will decide how much Angiox \n\nyou receive, and will prepare the medicine.  \n\n  \n\nThe dose given depends on your weight and on the kind of treatment you are being given. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 33 \n\nDosage \n\n \n\nFor patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who are treated medically the recommended \n\nstarting dose is: \n\n \n\n 0.1 mg/kg body weight as an intravenous injection, followed by an infusion (drip) into vein of \n\n0.25 mg/kg body weight per hour for up to 72 hours.   \n\n \n\nIf, after this, you then need percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment, the dosage will be \n\nincreased to: \n\n \n\n 0.5 mg/kg body weight for the intravenous injection, followed by an infusion into vein of \n\n1.75 mg/kg body weight, per hour for the duration of the PCI.  \n\n \n\n When this treatment is finished, the infusion may go back to 0.25 mg/kg body weight per hour \n\nfor an additional 4 to 12 hours. \n\n \n\nIf you need to have a coronary artery bypass graft operation, treatment with bivalirudin will either be \n\nstopped one hour before the operation or an additional dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight will be given by \n\ninjection followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg body weight per hour for the duration of surgery. \n\n \n\nFor patients starting with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) the recommended dose is: \n\n \n\n 0.75 mg/kg body weight as an intravenous injection, followed immediately by an infusion (drip) \n\ninto vein of 1.75 mg/kg body weight, per hour for at least the duration of the PCI. The \n\nintravenous infusion may continue at this dose for up to 4 hours after the PCI and for STEMI \n\npatients (those with a severe type of heart attack) it should continue at this dose for up to 4 \n\nhours. The infusion may be followed by an infusion at a lower dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight \n\nfor an additional 4 to 12 hours. \n\n \n\nIf you have kidney problems, the dose of Angiox may need to be reduced.  \n\n \n\nIn the elderly, if their kidney function is decreased, the dose may need to be reduced.  \n\n \n\nThe doctor will decide for how long you should be treated. \n\n \n\nAngiox is for injection, followed by infusion (drip), into a vein (never into a muscle). This is \n\nadministered and supervised by a doctor experienced in caring for patients with heart disease. \n\n \n\nIf you receive more of this medicine than you should \n\n \n\nYour doctor will decide how to treat you, including stopping the drug and monitoring for signs of ill \n\neffects. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS  \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nIf you get any of the following, potentially serious, side effects: \n\n \n\no while you are in hospital: tell the doctor or nurse immediately –  \n\no after you’ve left hospital: contact your doctor directly or go immediately to the Emergency \n\nDepartment of your nearest hospital -    \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 34 \n\nThe most common, (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) serious side effect of treatment with Angiox, is \n\nmajor bleeding which could occur anywhere inside the body (e.g. stomach, digestive system \n\n(including vomiting blood or passing blood with the stools), abdomen, lungs, groin, bladder, heart, \n\neye, ear, nose or brain). This may, rarely, result in a stroke or be fatal. Swelling or pain in the groin or \n\nthe arm, back pain, bruising, headache, coughing blood, pink or red urine, sweating, feeling faint or \n\nsick or dizzy due to low blood pressure may be signs of internal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to \n\noccur when Angiox is used in combination with other anticoagulant or antithrombotic medicines (see \n\nsection 2 ‘Taking other medicines’). \n\n \n\n Bleeding and bruising at the puncture site (after PCI treatment) may be painful. Rarely this may \nrequire surgery to repair the blood vessel in the groin (fistula, pseudoaneurysm) (may affect up \n\nto 1 in 1,000 people). Uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) the number of blood \n\nplatelets may be low which can worsen any bleeding. Gum bleeding (uncommon, may affect up \n\nto 1 in 100 people) is usually not serious.  \n\n \n\n Allergic reactions,- are uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) and usually not serious \nbut can become severe under some circumstances, and in rare cases may be fatal due to low \n\nblood pressure (shock). They may begin with limited symptoms such as itching, redness of the \n\nskin, rash or small bumps on the skin. Occasionally, reactions can be more severe with throat \n\nitching, throat tightening, swelling of the eyes, face, tongue or lips, high pitched whistling \n\nduring inhaling (stridor), difficulty breathing or exhaling (wheezes).  \n\n \n\n Thrombosis (blood clot) is an uncommon side effect (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) which \nmay result in serious or fatal complications such as heart attack. Thrombosis includes coronary \n\nartery thrombosis (blood clot in the heart arteries or within a stent being felt as a heart attack \n\nwhich can also be fatal) and/or thrombosis in the catheter, both of which are rare (may affect up \n\nto 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\nIf you get any of the following, (potentially less serious), side effects: \n\n \n\no while you are in hospital: tell the doctor or nurse -  \n\no after you’ve left hospital: first seek advice from your doctor. If you cannot get access to \n\nyour doctor go immediately to the Emergency Department of your nearest hospital -   \n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n Minor bleeding \n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n Anaemia (a low blood cell count) \n\n Haematoma (bruising) \n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting (being sick) \n \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) \n\n INR test (warfarin blood test result) increased (see Section 2, Other medicines and Angiox) \n\n Angina or chest pain \n\n Slow heartbeat \n\n Rapid heartbeat \n\n Shortness of breath \n\n Reperfusion injury (no or slow reflow): impaired flow in the heart arteries after they have been \nreopened \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 35 \n\nReporting of side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n\n \n\nHealthcare professionals should refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for full prescribing \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\nAngiox is indicated as an anticoagulant in adult patients undergoing percutaneous coronary \n\nintervention (PCI), including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) \n\nundergoing primary PCI. \n\n \n\nAngiox is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment \n\nelevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) planned for urgent or early intervention. \n\n \n\nAngiox should be administered with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. \n\n \n\nInstructions for preparation \n\n \n\nAseptic procedures should be used for the preparation and administration of Angiox. \n\n \n\nAdd 5 ml sterile water for injections to one vial of Angiox and swirl gently until completely dissolved \n\nand the solution is clear. \n\n \n\nWithdraw 5 ml from the vial, and further dilute in a total volume of 5% 50 ml of glucose solution for \n\ninjection, or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to give a final bivalirudin \n\nconcentration of 5 mg/ml. \n\n \n\nThe reconstituted/diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscolouration.  Solutions containing particulate matter should not be used. \n\n \n\nThe reconstituted/diluted solution will be a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow \n\nsolution. \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\nIncompatibilities \n\n \n\nThe following medicinal products should not be administered in the same intravenous line as \n\nbivalirudin since they result in haze formation, micro-particulate formation or gross precipitation; \n\nalteplase, amiodarone HCl, amphotericin B, chlorpromazine hydrochloride (HCl), diazepam, \n\nprochlorperazine edisylate, reteplase, streptokinase and vancomycin HCl. \n\n \n\nThe following six medicinal products show dose-concentration incompatibilities with bivalirudin. See \n\nsection 6.2 for the summary of compatible and incompatible concentrations of these compounds. The \n\nmedicinal products incompatible with bivalirudin at higher concentrations are: dobutamine \n\nhydrochloride, famotidine, haloperidol lactate, labetalol hydrochloride, lorazepam and promethazine \n\nHCl.   \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 39 \n\nContraindications \n\n \n\nAngiox is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n a known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, \nor to hirudins \n\n active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding because of haemostasis disorders and/or \nirreversible coagulation disorders \n\n severe uncontrolled hypertension \n\n subacute bacterial endocarditis \n\n severe renal impairment (GFR<30 ml/min) and in dialysis-dependent patients. \n(see section 4.3 of SmPC). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nPatients undergoing PCI, including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\n(STEMI) undergoing primary PCI \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of bivalirudin for patients undergoing PCI is an intravenous bolus of \n\n0.75 mg/kg body weight followed immediately by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1.75 mg/kg \n\nbody weight/hour for at least the duration of the procedure. The infusion of 1.75 mg/kg body \n\nweight/hour may be continued for up to 4 hours post-PCI and at a reduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg body \n\nweight/hour for an additional 4 – 12 hours as clinically necessary. In STEMI patients the infusion of \n\n1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour should be continued for up to 4 hours post-PCI and continued at a \n\nreduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg/h for an additional 4 – 12 hours as clinically necessary (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients should be carefully monitored following primary PCI for signs and symptoms consistent with \n\nmyocardial ischaemia.  \n\n \n\nPatients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevated myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of bivalirudin for medically managed patients with acute coronary \n\nsyndrome (ACS) is an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h. \n\nPatients who are to be medically managed may continue the infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for up to 72 \n\nhours.  \n\nIf the medically managed patient proceeds to PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of bivalirudin \n\nshould be administered before the procedure and the infusion increased to 1.75 mg/kg/h for the \n\nduration of the procedure. \n\nFollowing PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg/kg/h may be resumed for 4 to 12 hours as \n\nclinically necessary. \n\n \n\nFor patients who proceed to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery off pump, the intravenous \n\ninfusion of bivalirudin should be continued until the time of surgery. Just prior to surgery, a 0.5 mg/kg \n\nbolus dose should be administered followed by a 1.75 mg/kg/h intravenous infusion for the duration of \n\nthe surgery. \n\n \n\nFor patients who proceed to CABG surgery on pump, the intravenous infusion of bivalirudin should be \n\ncontinued until 1 hour prior to surgery after which the infusion should be discontinued and the patient \n\ntreated with unfractionated heparin (UFH).   \n\n \n\nTo ensure appropriate administration of bivalirudin, the completely dissolved, reconstituted and \n\ndiluted product should be thoroughly mixed prior to administration (see section 6.6). The bolus dose \n\nshould be administered by a rapid intravenous push to ensure that the entire bolus reaches the patient \n\nbefore the start of the procedure.  \n\n \n\nIntravenous infusion lines should be primed with bivalirudin to ensure continuity of drug infusion after \n\ndelivery of the bolus. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 40 \n\nThe infusion dose should be initiated immediately after the bolus dose is administered, ensuring \n\ndelivery to the patient prior to the procedure, and continued uninterrupted for the duration of the \n\nprocedure. The safety and efficacy of a bolus dose of bivalirudin without the subsequent infusion has \n\nnot been evaluated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.  \n\n \n\nAn increase in the activated clotting time (ACT) may be used as an indication that a patient has \n\nreceived bivalirudin.  \n\n \n\nRenal insufficiency \n\nAngiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR<30 ml/min) and also in \n\ndialysis-dependent patients (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency, the ACS dose (0.1 mg/kg bolus/0.25 mg/kg/h \n\ninfusion) should not be adjusted. \n\n \n\nPatients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min) undergoing PCI (whether being treated \n\nwith bivalirudin for ACS or not) should receive a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg/kg/h. The bolus dose \n\nshould not be changed from the posology described under ACS or PCI above. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed. \n\n(For full information on posology see section 4.2 of SmPC) \n\n \n\nShelf life \n\n \n\n4 years \n\n \n\nReconstituted solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at \n\n2-8\no\nC. Store in a refrigerator (2\n\n o\nC –8\n\no\nC). Do not freeze. \n\n \n\nDiluted solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 25\no\nC. \n\nDo not store above 25C.
