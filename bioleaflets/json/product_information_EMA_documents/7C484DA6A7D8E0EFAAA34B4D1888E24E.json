CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nGIOTRIF as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of \n Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) TKI-naïve adult patients with locally advanced or \n\nmetastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutation(s);\n Adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or \n\nafter platinum-based chemotherapy (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with GIOTRIF should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer therapies. \n\nEGFR mutation status should be established prior to initiation of GIOTRIF therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 40 mg once daily.\n\nThis medicinal product should be taken without food. Food should not be consumed for at least 3 hours \nbefore and at least 1 hour after taking this medicinal product (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\nGIOTRIF treatment should be continued until disease progression or until no longer tolerated by the patient \n(see Table 1 below). \n\nDose escalation\nA dose escalation to a maximum of 50 mg/day may be considered in patients who tolerate a 40 mg/day \nstarting dose (i.e. absence of diarrhoea, skin rash, stomatitis, and other adverse reactions with CTCAE \nGrade > 1) in the first cycle of treatment (21 days for EGFR mutation positive NSCLC and 28 days for \nsquamous NSCLC). The dose should not be escalated in any patients with a prior dose reduction. The \nmaximum daily dose is 50 mg.\n\nDose adjustment for adverse reactions\nSymptomatic adverse reactions (e.g. severe/persistent diarrhoea or skin related adverse reactions) may be \nsuccessfully managed by treatment interruption and dose reductions or treatment discontinuation of \nGIOTRIF as outlined in Table 1 (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\nTable 1: Dose adjustment information for adverse reactions\n\nCTCAEa Adverse reactions Recommended dosing\nGrade 1 or Grade 2 No interruption b No dose adjustment\nGrade 2 (prolonged c or intolerable) or\nGrade > 3\n\nInterrupt  until \nGrade 0/1 b\n\nResume with dose \nreduction by 10 mg \ndecrements d\n\na NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \nb In case of diarrhoea, anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g. loperamide) should be taken immediately and \ncontinued for persistent diarrhoea until loose bowel movements cease.\nc > 48 hours of diarrhoea and/or > 7 days of rash\nd If patient cannot tolerate 20 mg/day, permanent discontinuation of GIOTRIF should be considered\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD) should be considered if a patient develops acute or worsening of respiratory \nsymptoms in which case treatment should be interrupted pending evaluation. If ILD is diagnosed, GIOTRIF\nshould be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as necessary (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n4\n\nMissed dose\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken within the same day as soon as the patient remembers.  However, if the \nnext scheduled dose is due within 8 hours then the missed dose must be skipped.\n\nUse of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors\nIf P-gp inhibitors need to be taken, they should be administered using staggered dosing, i.e. the P-gp \ninhibitor dose should be taken as far apart in time as possible from the GIOTRIF dose. This means preferably \n6 hours (for P-gp inhibitors dosed twice daily) or 12 hours (for P-gp inhibitors dosed once daily) apart from\nGIOTRIF (see section 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nExposure to afatinib was found to be increased in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). Adjustments to the starting dose are not necessary in patients with mild (eGFR \n60-89 mL/min/1.73m²), moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m²) or severe (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m²) \nrenal impairment. Monitor patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m²) and adjust \nGIOTRIF dose if not tolerated. \nGIOTRIF treatment in patients with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m² or on dialysis is not recommended.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\nExposure to afatinib is not significantly changed in patients with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child\nPugh B) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Adjustments to the starting dose are not necessary in patients \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. This medicinal product has not been studied in patients with \nsevere (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Treatment in this population is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of GIOTRIF in the paediatric population in the indication of NSCLC. Therefore, \ntreatment of children or adolescents with this medicinal product is not recommended.\n\nMethod of administration\nThis medicinal product is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. If swallowing of \nwhole tablets is not possible, these can be dispersed in approximately 100 ml of non-carbonated drinking \nwater. No other liquids should be used. The tablet should be dropped into the water without crushing it, and \nstirred occasionally for up to 15 min until it is broken up into very small particles. The dispersion should be \nconsumed immediately. The glass should be rinsed with approximately 100 ml of water which should also be \nconsumed. The dispersion can also be administered through a gastric tube. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to afatinib or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAssessment of EGFR mutation status\nWhen assessing the EGFR mutation status of a patient, it is important that a well-validated and robust \nmethodology is chosen to avoid false negative or false positive determinations.\n\nDiarrhoea\nDiarrhoea, including severe diarrhoea, has been reported during treatment with GIOTRIF (see section 4.8). \nDiarrhoea may result in dehydration with or without renal impairment, which in rare cases has resulted in \nfatal outcomes. Diarrhoea usually occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Grade 3 diarrhoea most \nfrequently occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment. \n\n\n\n5\n\nProactive management of diarrhoea including adequate hydration combined with anti-diarrhoeal medicinal \nproducts especially within the first 6 weeks of the treatment is important and should start at first signs of \ndiarrhoea. Antidiarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g. loperamide) should be used and if necessary their dose \nshould be escalated to the highest recommended approved dose. Anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products should \nbe readily available to the patients so that treatment can be initiated at first signs of diarrhoea and continued \nuntil loose bowel movements cease for 12 hours. Patients with severe diarrhoea may require interruption and \ndose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with GIOTRIF (see section 4.2). Patients who become \ndehydrated may require administration of intravenous electrolytes and fluids. \n\nSkin related adverse events\nRash/acne has been reported in patients treated with this medicinal product (see section 4.8). In general, rash \nmanifests as a mild or moderate erythematous and acneiform rash, which may occur or worsen in areas \nexposed to sun. For patients who are exposed to sun, protective clothing, and use of sun screen is advisable.  \nEarly intervention (such as emollients, antibiotics) of dermatologic reactions can facilitate continuous \nGIOTRIF treatment. Patients with severe skin reactions may also require temporary interruption of therapy, \ndose reduction (see section 4.2), additional therapeutic intervention, and referral to a specialist with expertise \nin managing these dermatologic effects. \n\nBullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported including rare cases suggestive of \nStevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Treatment with this medicinal product should be \ninterrupted or discontinued if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nFemale gender, lower body weight, and underlying renal impairment\nHigher exposure to afatinib has been observed in female patients, patients with lower body weight and those \nwith underlying renal impairment (see section 5.2). This could result in a higher risk of developing adverse \nreactions in particular diarrhoea, rash/acne and stomatitis. Closer monitoring is recommended in patients \nwith these risk factors. \n\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)\nThere have been reports of ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (such as lung infiltration, pneumonitis, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome, allergic alveolitis), including fatalities, in patients receiving GIOTRIF for \ntreatment of NSCLC. ILD-like adverse reactions were reported in 0.7% of patients treated with GIOTRIF \nacross all clinical trials (including 0.5% of patients with CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 ILD-like adverse reactions). \nPatients with a history of ILD have not been studied.\n\nCareful assessment of all patients with an acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of pulmonary symptoms \n(dyspnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD. Treatment with this medicinal product should \nbe interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. If ILD is diagnosed, GIOTRIF should be \npermanently discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as necessary (see section 4.2). \n\nSevere hepatic impairment\nHepatic failure, including fatalities, has been reported during treatment with this medicinal product in less \nthan 1% of patients. In these patients, confounding factors have included pre-existing liver disease and/or \ncomorbidities associated with progression of underlying malignancy. Periodic liver function testing is \nrecommended in patients with pre-existing liver disease. In the pivotal trials Grade 3 alanine \naminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations were observed in 2.4% \n(LUX-Lung-3) and 1.6% (LUX-Lung 8) of patients with normal baseline liver tests treated with 40 mg/day. \nIn LUX-Lung-3 Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations were about 3.5 fold higher in patients with abnormal baseline \nliver tests. There were no Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations in patients with abnormal baseline liver tests in \nLUX-Lung 8 (see section 4.8). Dose interruption may become necessary in patients who experience \nworsening of liver function (see section 4.2). In patients who develop severe hepatic impairment while taking \nGIOTRIF, treatment should be discontinued. \n\nGastrointestinal perforations\nGastrointestinal perforation, including fatalities, has been reported during treatment with GIOTRIF in 0.2% \nof patients across all randomized controlled clinical trials. In the majority of cases, gastrointestinal \n\n\n\n6\n\nperforation was associated with other known risk factors, including concomitant medications such as \ncorticosteroids, NSAIDs, or anti-angiogenic agents, an underlying history of gastrointestinal ulceration, \nunderlying diverticular disease, age, or bowel metastases at sites of perforation. In patients who develop \ngastrointestinal perforation while taking GIOTRIF, treatment should be permanently discontinued.\n\nKeratitis\nSymptoms such as acute or worsening eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye \npain and/or red eye should be referred promptly to an ophthalmology specialist. If a diagnosis of ulcerative \nkeratitis is confirmed, treatment should be interrupted or discontinued. If keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits \nand risks of continuing treatment should be carefully considered. This medicinal product should be used with \ncaution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis or severe dry eye. Contact lens use is also a \nrisk factor for keratitis and ulceration (see section 4.8). \n\nLeft ventricular function\nLeft ventricular dysfunction has been associated with HER2 inhibition. Based on the available clinical trial \ndata, there is no suggestion that this medicinal product causes an adverse reaction on cardiac contractility. \nHowever, this medicinal product has not been studied in patients with abnormal left ventricular ejection \nfraction (LVEF) or those with significant cardiac history. In patients with cardiac risk factors and those with \nconditions that can affect LVEF, cardiac monitoring, including an assessment of LVEF at baseline and \nduring treatment, should be considered. In patients who develop relevant cardiac signs/symptoms during \ntreatment, cardiac monitoring including LVEF assessment should be considered. \n\nIn patients with an ejection fraction below the institution’s lower limit of normal, cardiac consultation as well \nas treatment interruption or discontinuation should be considered.\n\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) interactions\nConcomitant treatment with strong inducers of P-gp may decrease exposure to afatinib (see section 4.5).\n\nLactose\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary conditions of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteractions with drug transport systems\n\nEffects of P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors on afatinib\nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that afatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. When the strong P-gp and \nBCRP inhibitor ritonavir (200 mg twice a day for 3 days) was administered 1 hour before a single dose of \n20 mg GIOTRIF, exposure to afatinib increased by 48% (area under the curve (AUC0-∞)) and \n39% (maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)). In contrast, when ritonavir was administered simultaneously \nor 6 hours after 40 mg GIOTRIF, the relative bioavailability of afatinib was 119% (AUC0-∞) and \n104% (Cmax) and 111% (AUC0-∞) and 105% (Cmax), respectively. Therefore, it is recommended to administer \nstrong P-gp inhibitors (including but not limited to ritonavir, cyclosporine A, ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nerythromycin, verapamil, quinidine, tacrolimus, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and amiodarone) using staggered \ndosing, preferably 6 hours or 12 hours apart from GIOTRIF (see section 4.2).\n\nEffects of P-gp inducers on afatinib\nPre-treatment with rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 7 days), a potent inducer of P-gp, decreased the plasma \nexposure to afatinib by 34% (AUC0-∞) and 22% (Cmax) after administration of a single dose of 40 mg \nGIOTRIF. Strong P-gp inducers (including but not limited to rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may decrease exposure to afatinib (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nEffects of afatinib on P-gp substrates\nBased on in vitro data, afatinib is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp. However, based on clinical data it is \nconsidered unlikely that GIOTRIF treatment will result in changes of the plasma concentrations of other \n\n\n\n7\n\nP-gp substrates.\n\nInteractions with BCRP \nIn vitro studies indicated that afatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of the transporter BCRP. Afatinib may \nincrease the bioavailability of orally administered BCRP substrates (including but not limited to rosuvastatin \nand sulfasalazine).\n\nFood effect on afatinib\nCo-administration of a high-fat meal with GIOTRIF resulted in a significant decrease of exposure to afatinib \nby about 50% in regard to Cmax and 39% in regard to AUC0-∞. This medicinal product should be administered \nwithout food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nAs a precautionary measure, women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant \nwhile receiving treatment with GIOTRIF. Adequate contraceptive methods should be used during therapy \nand for at least 1 month after the last dose.\n\nPregnancy\nMechanistically, all EGFR targeting medicinal products have the potential to cause foetal harm.\nAnimal studies with afatinib did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). Studies in animals have shown no signs of teratogenicity up to and including \nmaternally lethal dose levels. Adverse changes were restricted to toxic dose levels. However, systemic \nexposures achieved in animals were either in a similar range or below the levels observed in patients (see \nsection 5.3). \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. The risk \nfor humans is thus unknown. If used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while or after\nreceiving GIOTRIF, she should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding\nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of afatinib in milk (see section 5.3). Based \non this, it is likely that afatinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-feeding child cannot be \nexcluded.  Mothers should be advised against breast-feeding while receiving this medicinal product.\n\nFertility\nFertility studies in humans have not been performed with afatinib. Available non-clinical toxicology data \nhave shown effects on reproductive organs at higher doses. Therefore, an adverse effect of this medicinal \nproduct on human fertility cannot be excluded. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nGIOTRIF has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. During treatment, ocular adverse \nreactions (conjunctivitis, dry eye, keratitis) have been reported in some patients (see section 4.8) which may \naffect patients ability to drive or use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe types of adverse reactions (ADRs) were generally associated with the EGFR inhibitory mode of action \nof afatinib. The summary of all ADRs is shown in Table 2. The most frequent ADRs were diarrhoea and skin \nrelated adverse events (see section 4.4) as well as stomatitis and paronychia (see also Table 3, 4 and 5). \nOverall, dose reduction (see section 4.2) led to a lower frequency of common adverse reactions. \n\nIn patients treated with once daily GIOTRIF 40 mg, dose reductions due to ADRs occurred in 57% of the \npatients in the LUX-Lung 3 trial and in 25% of the patients in the LUX-Lung 8 trial. Discontinuation due to \n\n\n\n8\n\nADRs diarrhoea and rash/acne was 1.3% and 0% in LUX-Lung 3 and 3.8% and 2.0% in LUX-Lung 8, \nrespectively.\n\nILD-like adverse reactions were reported in 0.7% of afatinib treated patients. Bullous, blistering and \nexfoliative skin conditions have been reported including rare cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome \nand toxic epidermal necrolysis although in these cases there were potential alternative aetiologies (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 2 summarises the frequencies of ADRs from all NSCLC trials and from post-marketing experience \nwith daily GIOTRIF doses of 40 mg or 50 mg as monotherapy. The following terms are used to rank the \nADRs by frequency: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); \nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).  Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2: Summary of ADRs per frequency category\n\nBody System Very \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon

Grade 2 ALT \nelevations occurred in 1% and Grade 3 elevations occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with GIOTRIF (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\nThe highest dose of afatinib studied in a limited number of patients in Phase I clinical trials was 160 mg once \ndaily for 3 days and 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks. The adverse reactions observed at these doses were \nprimarily dermatological (rash/acne) and gastrointestinal events (especially diarrhoea). Overdose in 2 healthy \nadolescents involving the ingestion of 360 mg each of afatinib (as part of a mixed drug ingestion) was \nassociated with adverse events of nausea, vomiting, asthenia, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain and \nelevated amylase (< 1.5 times ULN). Both individuals recovered from these adverse events. \n\nTreatment\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with this medicinal product.  In cases of suspected overdose, \nGIOTRIF should be withheld and supportive care initiated. \n\nIf indicated, elimination of unabsorbed afatinib may be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE13.\n\nMechanism of action\nAfatinib is a potent and selective, irreversible ErbB Family Blocker. Afatinib covalently binds to and \nirreversibly blocks signalling from all homo- and heterodimers formed by the ErbB family members EGFR \n(ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), ErbB3 and ErbB4. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nAberrant ErbB signalling triggered by receptor mutations, and/or amplification, and/or receptor ligand \noverexpression contributes to the malignant phenotype. Mutation in EGFR defines a distinct molecular \nsubtype of lung cancer. \n\nIn non-clinical disease models with ErbB pathway deregulation, afatinib as a single agent effectively blocks \nErbB receptor signalling resulting in tumour growth inhibition or tumour regression. NSCLC tumours with \ncommon activating EGFR mutations (Del 19, L858R) and several less common EGFR mutations in exon 18 \n(G719X) and exon 21 (L861Q) are particularly sensitive to afatinib treatment in non-clinical and clinical \nsettings. Limited non-clinical and/or clinical activity was observed in NSCLC tumours with insertion \nmutations in exon 20.\n\nThe acquisition of a secondary T790M mutation is a major mechanism of acquired resistance to afatinib and \ngene dosage of the T790M-containing allele correlates with the degree of resistance in vitro. The T790M \nmutation is found in approximately 50% of patients' tumours upon disease progression on afatinib, for which \nT790M targeted EGFR TKIs may be considered as a next line treatment option. Other potential mechanisms \nof resistance to afatinib have been suggested preclinically and MET gene amplification has been observed \nclinically.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nGIOTRIF in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations\n\nLUX-Lung 3\nIn the first-line setting, the efficacy and safety of GIOTRIF in patients with EGFR mutation-positive locally \nadvanced or metastatic NSCLC (stage IIIB or IV) were assessed in a global, randomised, multicentre, \nopen-label trial. Patients were screened for the presence of 29 different EGFR mutations using a polymerase \nchain reaction (PCR)-based method (TheraScreen®: EGFR29 Mutation Kit, Qiagen Manchester Ltd). \nPatients were randomised (2:1) to receive GIOTRIF 40 mg once daily or up to 6 cycles of \npemetrexed/cisplatin. Among the patients randomised, 65% were female, the median age was 61 years, the \nbaseline ECOG performance status was 0 (39%) or 1 (61%), 26% were Caucasian and 72% were Asian. 89% \nof patients had common EGFR mutations (Del 19 or L858R).\n\nThe primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) by independent review; the secondary endpoints \nincluded overall survival and objective response rate. At the time of the analysis, 14 Nov 2013, 176 patients \n(76.5%) in the afatinib arm and 70 patients (60.9%) in the chemotherapy arm experienced an event \ncontributing to the PFS analysis, i.e. disease progression as determined by central independent review or \ndeath. The efficacy results are provided in Figure 1, Tables 6 and 7.\n\n\n\n13\n\nLUX-Lung 6\nThe efficacy and safety of GIOTRIF in Asian patients with Stage IIIB/IV EGFR mutation-positive locally \nadvanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung was evaluated in a randomised, multicentre, open-label \ntrial. Similar to LUX-Lung 3, patients with previously untreated NSCLC were screened for EGFR mutations \nusing TheraScreen®: EGFR29 Mutation Kit (Qiagen Manchester Ltd). Among randomized patients, 65% \nwere female, the median age was 58 years and all patients were of Asian ethnicity. Patients with common \nEGFR mutations accounted for 89% of the study population.\n\nThe primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by central independent review; secondary endpoints included OS \nand ORR. \nBoth trials demonstrated significant improvement in PFS of EGFR mutation positive patients treated with \nGIOTRIF compared to chemotherapy. The efficacy results are summarized in Figure 1 (LUX-Lung 3) and \nTables 6 and 7 (LUX-Lung 3 and 6). Table 7 shows outcomes in the subgroups of patients with two common \nEGFR mutations – Del 19 and L858R.\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS by independent review by treatment group in trial LUX-Lung 3 \n(Overall Population)\n\n\n\n14\n\nTable 6: Efficacy results of GIOTRIF vs. pemetrexed/cisplatin (LUX-Lung 3) gemcitabine/cisplatin \n(LUX-Lung 6) (Independent review)\n\nLUX-Lung 3 LUX-Lung 6\nGIOTRIF\n\n(N=230)\n\nPemetrexed/\nCisplatin\n(N=115)\n\nGIOTRIF\n\n(N=242)\n\nGemcitabine/\nCisplatin\n(N=122)\n\nProgression-free survival \nMonths (median) \n\n11.2 6.9 11.0 5.6\n\nHazard Ratio (HR)\n(95%CI)\n\n0.58\n(0.43-0.78)\n\n0.28\n(0.20-0.39)\n\np-value1 0.0002 <0.0001\n1-year PFS Rate 48.1% 22.0% 46.7% 2.1%\nObjective Response Rate \n(CR+PR)2 56.5% 22.6% 67.8% 23.0%\nOdds Ratio (OR)\n(95%CI)\n\n4.80\n(2.89-8.08)\n\n7.57\n(4.52-12.68)\n\np-value1 <0.0001 <0.0001\nOverall Survival (OS)\nMonths (median)\n\n28.2 28.2 23.1 23.5\n\nHazard Ratio (HR)\n(95%CI)\n\n0.88\n(0.66-1.17)\n\n0.93\n(0.72-1.22)\n\np-value1 0.3850 0.6137\n1 p-value for PFS/OS based on stratified log-rank test; p-value for Objective Response Rate based on logistic regression\n2 CR=complete response; PR=partial response\n\n\n\n15\n\nTable 7: PFS and OS efficacy results of GIOTRIF vs pemetrexed/cisplatin (LUX-Lung 3) \ngemcitabine/cisplatin (LUX-Lung 6) in the pre-defined EGFR mutation subgroups Del 19 and L858R \n(Independent review)\n\nLUX-Lung 3 LUX-Lung 6\n\nDel19\nGIOTRIF\n\n(N=112)\n\nPemetrexed/\nCisplatin\n(N=57)\n\nGIOTRIF\n\n(N=124)\n\nGemcitabine/\nCisplatin\n(N=62)\n\nProgression-free survival \nMonths (median) \n\n13.8 5.6 13.1 5.6\n\nHazard Ratio (HR)\n(95%CI)\n\n0.26\n(0.17-0.42)\n\n0.20\n(0.13-0.33)\n\np-value1 <0.0001 <0.0001\nOverall Survival (OS)\nMonths (median)\n\n33.3 21.1 31.4 18.4\n\nHazard Ratio (HR)\n(95%CI)\n\n0.54\n(0.36-0.79)\n\n0.64\n(0.44-0.94)\n\np-value1 0.0015 0.0229\n\nL858R\nGIOTRIF\n\n(N=91)\n\nPemetrexed/\nCisplatin\n(N=47)\n\nGIOTRIF\n\n(N=92)\n\nGemcitabine/\nCisplatin\n(N=46)\n\nProgression-free survival \nMonths (median) \n\n10.8 8.1 9.6 5.6\n\nHazard Ratio (HR)\n(95%CI)\n\n0.75\n(0.48-1.19)\n\n0.31\n(0.19-0.52)\n\np-value1 0.2191 <0.0001\nOverall Survival (OS)\nMonths (median)\n\n27.6 40.3 19.6 24.3\n\nHazard Ratio (HR)\n(95%CI)\n\n1.30\n(0.80-2.11)\n\n1.22\n(0.81-1.83)\n\np-value1 0.2919 0.3432\n1 p-value for PFS/OS based on stratified log-rank test\n\nIn the pre-defined subgroup of common mutations (combined Del 19 and L858R) for GIOTRIF and \nchemotherapy, the median PFS was 13.6 months vs. 6.9 months (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.35-0.66; p<0.0001; \nN=307) in LUX-Lung 3, and 11.0 months vs. 5.6 months (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.17-0.35; p<0.0001; N=324) in \nLUX-Lung 6, respectively.\n\nPFS benefit was accompanied by improvement in disease-related symptoms and delayed time to \ndeterioration (see Table 8).

The updated \nmedian OS for first- and second-line was 31.7 months and 23.6 months, respectively.\n\nLUX-Lung 7\nLUX-Lung 7 is a randomised, global, open label Phase IIb trial investigating the efficacy and safety of \nGIOTRIF in patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIB or IV) with EGFR \nmutations in the first-line setting. Patients were screened for the presence of activating EGFR mutations (Del \n19 and/or L858R) using the TheraScreen® EGFR RGQ PCR Kit, Qiagen Manchester Ltd. Patients (N=319) \nwere randomised (1:1) to receive GIOTRIF® 40 mg orally once daily (N=160) or gefitinib 250 mg orally \nonce daily (N=159). Randomisation was stratified according to EGFR mutation status (Del 19; L858R) and \npresence of brain metastases (yes; no).\n\nAmong the patients randomised, 62% were female, the median age was 63 years, 16% of patients had brain \nmetastases, the baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (31%) or 1 (69%), 57% were Asian and 43% were \nnon-Asian. Patients had a tumour sample with an EGFR mutation categorised as either exon 19 deletion \n(58%) or exon 21 L858R substitutions (42%).\n\nThe co-primary endpoints include PFS by independent review and OS. Secondary endpoints include ORR \nand DCR. GIOTRIF significantly improved PFS and ORR in EGFR mutation positive patients compared to \ngefitinib. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 9.\n\n\n\n17\n\nTable 9: Efficacy results of GIOTRIF vs. gefitinib (LUX-Lung 7) based on primary analysis as of August \n2015.\n\nGIOTRIF\n(N=160)\n\nGefitinib\n(N=159)\n\nHazard Ratio/\nOdds Ratio\n\n(95%CI)\np-value2\n\nMedian PFS (months), Overall \nTrial Population\n\n18-months PFS rate\n24-months PFS rate\n\n11.0\n\n27%\n18%\n\n10.9\n\n15%\n8%\n\nHR 0.73\n(0.57-0.95)\n\n0.0165\n\nMedian OS (months)1, Overall \nTrial Population \n\nAlive at 18-months\nAlive at 24-months\n\n27.9\n\n71%\n61%\n\n24.5\n\n67%\n51%\n\nHR 0.86\n(0.66, 1.12)\n\n0.2580\n\nObjective Response Rate \n(CR+PR)3\n\n70% 56% OR 1.87\n(1.12, 2.99)\n\n0.0083\n1OS results based on primary OS analysis as of April 2016 at event rates of 109 (68.1%) and 117 (73.6%) in \nthe GIOTRIF and gefitinib arms, respectively\n2p-value for PFS/OS based on stratified log-rank test; p-value for Objective Response Rate based on \nstratified logistic regression\n3CR=complete response; PR=partial response\n\nThe PFS hazard ratio for patients with DEL 19 mutations and L858R mutations was 0.76 (95% CI \n[0.55, 1.06]; p=0.1071), and 0.71 (95% CI [0.47, 1.06]; p=0.0856) respectively for afatinib vs gefitinib.\n\nAnalysis of GIOTRIF’s efficacy in EGFR TKI naïve patients with tumours harbouring uncommon EGFR \nMutations (LUX-Lung 2, -3, and -6)\nIn three clinical trials of GIOTRIF with prospective tumour genotyping (Phase 3 trials LUX-Lung 3 and -6, \nand single arm Phase 2 trial LUX-Lung 2), an analysis was conducted of data from a total of 75 TKI-naïve\npatients with advanced (stage IIIb–IV) lung adenocarcinomas harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations, \nwhich were defined as all mutations other than Del 19 and L858R mutations. Patients were treated with \nGIOTRIF 40 mg (all three trials) or 50 mg (LUX-Lung 2) orally once daily.\n\nIn patients with tumours harbouring either G719X (N=18), L861Q (N=16), or S768I substitution mutation \n(N=8), the confirmed ORR was 72.2%, 56.3%, 75.0%, respectively, and the median duration of response was \n13.2 months, 12.9 months and 26.3 months, respectively. \n\nIn patients with tumours harbouring exon 20 insertions (N=23) the confirmed ORR was 8.7% and the median \nduration of response was 7.1 months. In patients with tumours harbouring de-novo T790M mutations (N=14) \nthe confirmed ORR was 14.3% and the median duration of response was 8.3 months.\n\nGIOTRIF in patients with NSCLC of squamous histology\n\nThe efficacy and safety of GIOTRIF as second-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC of \nsquamous histology was investigated in a randomized open-label global Phase III trial LUX-Lung 8. Patients \nwho received at least 4 cycles of platinum-based therapy in the first line setting were subsequently \nrandomized 1:1 to daily GIOTRIF 40 mg or erlotinib 150 mg until progression. Randomization was stratified \nby race (Eastern Asian vs non Eastern Asian). The primary endpoint was PFS; OS was the key secondary \nendpoint. Other secondary endpoints included ORR, DCR, change in tumour size and HRQOL.\nAmong 795 patients randomized, the majority were males (84%), white (73%), current or former smokers \n(95%) with baseline performance status ECOG 1 (67%) and ECOG 0 (33%).\n\n\n\n18\n\nSecond-line GIOTRIF significantly improved PFS and OS of patients with squamous NSCLC compared to \nerlotinib.

Cmax and AUC0-∞ values increased slightly more than proportionally in the dose range from 20 mg to \n50 mg GIOTRIF. Systemic exposure to afatinib is decreased by 50% (Cmax) and 39% (AUC0-∞), when \nadministered with a high-fat meal compared to administration in the fasted state. Based on population \npharmacokinetic data derived from clinical trials in various tumour types, an average decrease of 26% in \nAUCτ,ss was observed when food was consumed within 3 hours before or 1 hour after taking GIOTRIF. \nTherefore, food should not be consumed for at least 3 hours before and at least 1 hour after taking GIOTRIF \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nDistribution\nIn vitro binding of afatinib to human plasma proteins is approximately 95%. Afatinib binds to proteins both \nnon-covalently (traditional protein binding) and covalently.\n\nBiotransformation\nEnzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions play a negligible role for afatinib in vivo. Covalent adducts to proteins \nwere the major circulating metabolites of afatinib.\n\nElimination\nIn humans, excretion of afatinib is primarily via the faeces. Following administration of an oral solution of \n15 mg afatinib, 85.4% of the dose was recovered in the faeces and 4.3% in urine. The parent compound \nafatinib accounted for 88% of the recovered dose. Afatinib is eliminated with an effective half-life of\napproximately 37 hours. Thus, steady state plasma concentrations of afatinib were achieved within 8 days of \nmultiple dosing of afatinib resulting in an accumulation of 2.77-fold (AUC0-∞) and 2.11-fold (Cmax). In \npatients treated with afatinib for more than 6 months a terminal half-life of 344 h was estimated.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nLess than 5% of a single dose of afatinib is excreted via the kidneys. Exposure to afatinib in subjects with \nrenal impairment was compared to healthy volunteers following a single dose of 40 mg GIOTRIF. Subjects \nwith moderate renal impairment (n=8; eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m², according to the Modification of Diet in \nRenal Disease [MDRD] formula) had an exposure of 101% (Cmax) and 122% (AUC0-tz) in comparison to their \nhealthy controls. Subjects with severe renal impairment (n=8; eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m², according to the \n\n\n\n20\n\nMDRD formula) had an exposure of 122% (Cmax) and 150% (AUC0-tz) in comparison to their healthy \ncontrols. Based on this trial and population pharmacokinetic analysis of data derived from clinical trials in \nvarious tumour types, it is concluded, that adjustments to the starting dose in patients with mild (eGFR \n60-89 mL/min/1.73m²), moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m²), or severe (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m²) \nrenal impairment are not necessary, but patients with severe impairment should be monitored (see \n“Population pharmacokinetic analysis in special populations” below and section 4.2). GIOTRIF has not been \nstudied in patients with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m² or on dialysis.\n\nHepatic impairment\nAfatinib is eliminated mainly by biliary/faecal excretion. Subjects with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate \n(Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment had similar exposure in comparison to healthy volunteers following a \nsingle dose of 50 mg GIOTRIF. This is consistent with population pharmacokinetic data derived from \nclinical trials in various tumour types (see “Population pharmacokinetic analysis in special populations”\nbelow). No starting dose adjustments appear necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment\n(see section 4.2). The pharmacokinetics of afatinib have not been studied in subjects with severe \n(Child Pugh C) hepatic dysfunction (see section 4.4). \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in special populations\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 927 cancer patients (764 with NSCLC) receiving \nGIOTRIF monotherapy. No starting dose adjustment was considered necessary for any of the following \ncovariates tested.\n\nAge\nNo significant impact of age (range: 28 years - 87 years) on the pharmacokinetics of afatinib could be \nobserved. \n\nBody weight\nPlasma exposure (AUCτ,ss) was increased by 26% for a 42 kg patient (2.5\n\nth percentile) and decreased by 22% \nfor a 95 kg patient (97.5th percentile) relative to a patient weighing 62 kg (median body weight of patients in \nthe overall patient population). \n\nGender\nFemale patients had a 15% higher plasma exposure (AUCτ,ss, body weight corrected) than male patients. \n\nRace\nRace had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of afatinib based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, \nincluding patients of Asian, White, and Black racial groups. Data on Black racial groups was limited.\n\nRenal impairment\nExposure to afatinib moderately increased with lowering of the creatinine clearance (CrCL, calculated \naccording to Cockcroft Gault), i.e. for a patient with a CrCL of 60 mL/min or 30 mL/min exposure (AUCτ,ss) \nto afatinib increased by 13% and 42%, respectively, and decreased by 6% and 20% for a patient with CrCL \nof 90 mL/min or 120 mL/min, respectively, compared to a patient with the CrCL of 79 mL/min (median \nCrCL of patients in the overall patient population analysed). \n\nHepatic impairment\nPatients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment as identified by abnormal liver tests did not correlate \nwith any significant change in afatinib exposure. There was limited data available for moderate and severe \nhepatic impairment.\n\nOther patient characteristics/intrinsic factors\nOther patient characteristics/intrinsic factors found with a significant impact on afatinib exposure were: \nECOG performance score, lactate dehydrogenase levels, alkaline phosphatase levels and total protein. The \nindividual effect sizes of these covariates were considered not clinically relevant. Smoking history, alcohol \nconsumption (limited data), or presence of liver metastases had no significant impact on the \npharmacokinetics of afatinib. \n\n\n\n21\n\nOther information on drug-drug interactions\n\nInteractions with drug uptake transport systems \nIn vitro data indicated that drug-drug interactions with afatinib due to inhibition of OATB1B1, OATP1B3, \nOATP2B1, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3 transporters are considered unlikely.\n\nInteractions with Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes\nIn humans it was found that enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions play a negligible role for the metabolism \nof afatinib. Approximately 2% of the afatinib dose was metabolized by FMO3 and the CYP3A4-dependent \nN-demethylation was too low to be quantitatively detected. Afatinib is not an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP \nenzymes. Therefore, this medicinal product is unlikely to interact with other medicines that modulate or are \nmetabolised by CYP enzymes.\n\nEffect of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibition on afatinib\nIn vitro data indicated that drug-drug interactions with afatinib due to inhibition of UGT1A1 are considered \nunlikely.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nOral administration of single doses to mice and rats indicated a low acute toxic potential of afatinib. In oral \nrepeated-dose studies for up to 26 weeks in rats or 52 weeks in minipigs the main effects were identified in \nthe skin (dermal changes, epithelial atrophy and folliculitis in rats), the gastrointestinal tract (diarrhoea, \nerosions in the stomach, epithelial atrophy in rats and minipigs) and the kidneys (papillary necrosis in rats). \nDepending on the finding, these changes occurred at exposures below, in the range of or above clinically \nrelevant levels. Additionally, in various organs pharmacodynamically mediated atrophy of epithelia was \nobserved in both species.\n\nReproduction toxicity\nBased on the mechanism of action, all EGFR targeting medicinal products including GIOTRIF have the \npotential to cause foetal harm. The embryo-foetal development studies performed on afatinib revealed no \nindication of teratogenicity. The respective total systemic exposure (AUC) was either slightly above \n(2.2 times in rats) or below (0.3 times in rabbits) compared with levels in patients. \n\nRadiolabelled afatinib administered orally to rats on Day 11 of lactation was excreted in the breast milk of \nthe dams. \n\nA fertility study in male and female rats up to the maximum tolerated dose revealed no significant impact on \nfertility. The total systemic exposure (AUC0-24) in male and female rats was in the range or less than that \nobserved in patients (1.3 times and 0.51 times, respectively).  \nA study in rats up to the maximum tolerated doses revealed no significant impact on pre-/postnatal \ndevelopment. The highest total systemic exposure (AUC0-24) in female rats was less than that observed in \npatients (0.23 times).\n\nPhototoxicity \nAn in vitro 3T3 test showed that afatinib may have phototoxicity potential. \n\nCarcinogenicity\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with GIOTRIF.\n\n\n\n22\n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If any of these side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \n\ntell your doctor or pharmacist.

How to store GIOTRIF \n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What GIOTRIF is and what it is used for\n\nGIOTRIF is a medicine which contains the active substance afatinib. It works by blocking the activity of a \ngroup of proteins called the ErbB family (including EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor or ErbB1], \nHER2 [ErbB2], ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells, and \ncan be affected by changes (mutations) in the genes that produce them. By blocking the activity of these\nproteins this medicine can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\nThis medicine is used on its own to treat adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung (non-small \ncell lung cancer):\n\n that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR. GIOTRIF can be prescribed to you as \nyour first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.\n\n of squamous type if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient. \n\n2.

Also, tell your doctor if you had gastrointestinal ulcers or diverticular \ndisease in the past, or are concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (used to \ntreat pain relief and swelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and allergies), as this may increase \nthis risk.\n\n if you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred vision \nand/or sensitivity to light. You may need urgent treatment.\n\nSee also section 4 “Possible side effects”.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nGIOTRIF has not been studied in children or adolescents.

It works by blocking the activity of a \ngroup of proteins called the ErbB family (including EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor or ErbB1], \nHER2 [ErbB2], ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells, and \ncan be affected by changes (mutations) in the genes that produce them. By blocking the activity of these \nproteins this medicine can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\nThis medicine is used on its own to treat adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung (non-small \ncell lung cancer):\n\n that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR.

How to store GIOTRIF \n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What GIOTRIF is and what it is used for\n\nGIOTRIF is a medicine which contains the active substance afatinib. It works by blocking the activity of a \ngroup of proteins called the ErbB family (including EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor or ErbB1], \nHER2 [ErbB2], ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells, and \ncan be affected by changes (mutations) in the genes that produce them. By blocking the activity of these \nproteins this medicine can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\nThis medicine is used on its own to treat adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung (non-small \ncell lung cancer):\n\n that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR. GIOTRIF can be prescribed to you as \nyour first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.\n\n of squamous type if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient. \n\n2.
