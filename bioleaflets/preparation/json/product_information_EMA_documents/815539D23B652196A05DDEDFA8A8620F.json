This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nZEPATIER 50 mg/100 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 50 mg elbasvir and 100 mg grazoprevir.\n\nExcipients with known effect\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 87.02 mg of lactose (as monohydrate) and 69.85 mg of sodium.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet.\n\nBeige, oval tablet of dimensions 21 mm x 10 mm debossed with “770” on one side and plain on the\nother.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZEPATIER is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4\nand 5.1).\n\nFor hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-specific activity see sections 4.4 and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nZEPATIER treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of patients with CHC.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet once daily.\n\nRecommended regimens and treatment durations are provided in Table 1 below (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.1):\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1: Recommended ZEPATIER therapy for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in \npatients with or without compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A only)\nHCV genotype Treatment and duration \n\n1a ZEPATIER for 12 weeks\n\nZEPATIER for 16 weeks plus ribavirinA should be considered in \npatients with baseline HCV RNA level >800,000 IU/mL and/or the\npresence of specific NS5A polymorphisms causing at least a 5-fold \nreduction in activity of elbasvir to minimise the risk of treatment failure \n(see section 5.1).\n\n1b ZEPATIER for 12 weeks\n\n4 ZEPATIER for 12 weeks\n\nZEPATIER for 16 weeks plus ribavirinA should be considered in \npatients with baseline HCV RNA level >800,000 IU/mL to minimise \nthe risk of treatment failure (see section 5.1).\n\nA In the clinical studies, the dose of ribavirin was weight-based (< 66 kg = 800 mg/day, 66 to 80 kg =\n1,000 mg/day, 81 to 105 kg = 1,200 mg/day, > 105 kg = 1,400 mg/day) administered in two divided \ndoses with food.\n\nFor specific dosage instructions for ribavirin, including dose modification, refer to the ribavirin \nSummary of Product Characteristics.\n\nPatients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 4 hours of dosing, an additional tablet can \nbe taken up to 8 hours before the next dose. If vomiting occurs more than 4 hours after dosing, no \nfurther dose is needed.\n\nIn case a dose of ZEPATIER is missed and it is within 16 hours of the time ZEPATIER is usually \ntaken, the patient should be instructed to take ZEPATIER as soon as possible and then take the next \ndose of ZEPATIER at the usual time. If more than 16 hours have passed since ZEPATIER is usually\ntaken, then the patient should be instructed that the missed dose should NOT be taken and to take the \nnext dose per the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required for elderly patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment and end stage renal disease (ESRD)\nNo dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal \nimpairment (including patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nA). ZEPATIER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nB or C) (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nThe safety and efficacy of ZEPATIER have not been established in liver transplant recipients. \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of ZEPATIER in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor oral use.\n\nThe film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and may be taken with or without food (see \nsection 5.2). \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nCo-administration with inhibitors of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B (OATP1B), such as \nrifampicin, atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, cobicistat or ciclosporin (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), such as \nefavirenz, phenytoin, carbamazepine, bosentan, etravirine, modafinil or St. John’s wort (Hypericum \nperforatum) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nALT elevations\n\nThe rate of late ALT elevations during treatment is directly related to the plasma exposure to \ngrazoprevir. During clinical studies with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin, < 1 % of subjects \nexperienced elevations of ALT from normal levels to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal \n(ULN), (see section 4.8). Higher rates of late ALT elevations occurred in females (2 % [11/652]),\nAsians (2 % [4/165]), and subjects aged ≥ 65 years (2 % [3/187]) (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). These late \nALT elevations generally occurred at or after treatment week 8.\n\nHepatic laboratory testing should be performed prior to therapy, at treatment week 8, and as clinically \nindicated. For patients receiving 16 weeks of therapy, additional hepatic laboratory testing should be \nperformed at treatment week 12.\n Patients should be instructed to consult their healthcare professional without delay if they have \n\nonset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discoloured\nfaeces.\n\n Discontinuation of ZEPATIER should be considered if ALT levels are confirmed to be greater \nthan 10 times the ULN.\n\n ZEPATIER should be discontinued if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of \nliver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or international \nnormalised ratio (INR).\n\nGenotype-specific activity\n\nThe efficacy of ZEPATIER has not been demonstrated in HCV genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6. ZEPATIER is \nnot recommended in patients infected with these genotypes.\n\nRetreatment\n\nThe efficacy of ZEPATIER in patients previously exposed to ZEPATIER, or to medicinal products of \nthe same classes as those of ZEPATIER (NS5A inhibitors or NS3/4A inhibitors other than telaprevir, \nsimeprevir, boceprevir), has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\n\nCo-administration of ZEPATIER and OATP1B inhibitors is contraindicated because it may \nsignificantly increase grazoprevir plasma concentrations. \n\nCo-administration of ZEPATIER and CYP3A or P-gp inducers is contraindicated because it may \nsignificantly decrease elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced \ntherapeutic effect of ZEPATIER (see sections 4.3, 4.5 and 5.2). \n\nThe concomitant use of ZEPATIER and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases elbasvir and grazoprevir \nconcentrations, and co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\nHCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection\n\nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should \ntherefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.\n\nUse in diabetic patients\n\nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control potentially resulting in symptomatic \n\nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. Glucose levels of \n\ndiabetic patients initiating DAA therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the first \n\n3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the \n\ndiabetic care of the patient should be informed when DAA therapy is initiated.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nZEPATIER is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because the \nsafety and efficacy have not been established in this population.\n\nExcipients\n\nZEPATIER contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct.\n\nZEPATIER contains 69.85 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 3.5 % of the WHO recommended\nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ZEPATIER\n\nGrazoprevir is a substrate of OATP1B drug transporters. Co-administration of ZEPATIER with \nmedicinal products that inhibit OATP1B transporters is contraindicated because it may result in a\nsignificant increase in the plasma concentration of grazoprevir (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nElbasvir and grazoprevir are substrates of CYP3A and P-gp. Co-administration of inducers of CYP3A\nor P-gp with ZEPATIER is contraindicated because it may decrease elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma \nconcentrations, which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of ZEPATIER (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\nCo-administration of ZEPATIER with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases elbasvir and grazoprevir \nplasma concentrations, and co-administration is not recommended (see Table 2 and section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nCo-administration of ZEPATIER with P-gp inhibitors is expected to have a minimal effect on the \nplasma concentrations of ZEPATIER.\n\nThe potential for grazoprevir to be a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrate cannot be \nexcluded.\n\nPotential for ZEPATIER to affect other medicinal products\n\nElbasvir and grazoprevir are inhibitors of the drug transporter BCRP at the intestinal level in humans \nand may increase plasma concentrations of co-administered BCRP substrates. Elbasvir is not a \nCYP3A inhibitor in vitro and grazoprevir is a weak CYP3A inhibitor in humans. Co-administration \nwith grazoprevir did not result in clinically relevant increases in exposures of CYP3A substrates. \nTherefore, no dose adjustment is required for CYP3A substrates when co-administered with \nZEPATIER. \n\nElbasvir has minimal intestinal P-gp inhibition in humans, and does not result in clinically relevant \nincreases in concentrations of digoxin (a P-gp substrate), with an 11% increase in plasma AUC. \nGrazoprevir is not a P-gp inhibitor based on in vitro data. Elbasvir and grazoprevir are not OATP1B \ninhibitors in humans. Based on in vitro data, clinically significant interactions with ZEPATIER as an \ninhibitor of other CYP enzymes, UGT1A1, esterases (CES1, CES2, and CatA), OAT1, OAT3, and \nOCT2 are not expected. Based on in vitro data, a potential for GZR to inhibit BSEP cannot be\nexcluded. Multiple-dose administration of elbasvir or grazoprevir is unlikely to induce the metabolism \nof medicinal products metabolised by CYP isoforms based on in vitro data.\n\nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \n\nAs liver function may change during treatment with ZEPATIER, a close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.\n\nImpact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver\n\nGrazoprevir’s weak inhibition of CYP3A may increase levels of CYP3A substrates. In addition, the \nplasma concentrations of drugs that are CYP3A substrates may be decreased by improvement in liver \nfunction during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV. Therefore, close monitoring and potential \ndose adjustment of CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) \nmay be required during therapy, as drug levels may change (see Table 2).\n\nInteractions between ZEPATIER and other medicinal products \n\nTable 2 provides a listing of assessed or potential medicinal product interactions. An up “↑” or down \n“↓” arrow represents a change in exposure that requires monitoring or a dose adjustment of that \nmedication, or the co-administration is not recommended or contraindicated. No clinically relevant \nchange in exposure is represented by a horizontal arrow “↔”. \n\nThe medicinal product interactions described are based on results from studies conducted with either \nZEPATIER or elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal \nproduct interactions that may occur with elbasvir or grazoprevir.

Animal \nstudies do not indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Because reproduction \n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nanimal studies are not always predictive of human response, ZEPATIER should be used only if the \npotential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether elbasvir or grazoprevir and their metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals has shown excretion of elbasvir and grazoprevir in milk. A \ndecision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nZEPATIER therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of elbasvir and grazoprevir on fertility are available. Animal studies do \nnot indicate harmful effects of elbasvir or grazoprevir on fertility at elbasvir and grazoprevir exposures \nhigher than the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nZEPATIER (administered alone or in combination with ribavirin) is not likely to have an effect on the \nability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that fatigue has been reported during \ntreatment with ZEPATIER (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety of ZEPATIER was assessed based on 3 placebo-controlled studies and 7 uncontrolled \nPhase 2 and 3 clinical studies in approximately 2,000 subjects with chronic hepatitis C infection with \ncompensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis).\n\nIn clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were fatigue and \nheadache. Less than 1 % of subjects treated with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin had serious \nadverse reactions (abdominal pain, transient ischaemic attack and anaemia). Less than 1 % of subjects \ntreated with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse \nreactions. The frequency of serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in \nsubjects with compensated cirrhosis were comparable to those seen in subjects without cirrhosis.\n\nWhen elbasvir/grazoprevir was studied with ribavirin, the most frequent adverse reactions to \nelbasvir/grazoprevir + ribavirin combination therapy were consistent with the known safety profile of \nribavirin.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions were identified in patients taking ZEPATIER without ribavirin for 12 \nweeks. The adverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies \nare defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or very rare (< 1/10,000).\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nTable 3: Adverse reactions identified with ZEPATIER*\n\nFrequency Adverse reactions\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders:\nCommon decreased appetite\nPsychiatric disorders:\nCommon insomnia, anxiety, depression\nNervous system disorders: \nVery common headache\nCommon dizziness\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nCommon nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, upper abdominal pain, abdominal \n\npain, dry mouth, vomiting\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nCommon pruritus, alopecia\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:\nCommon arthralgia, myalgia\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common fatigue\nCommon asthenia, irritability\n*Based on pooled data from patients treated with ZEPATIER for 12 weeks without ribavirin\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nLaboratory abnormalities\n\nChanges in selected laboratory parameters are described in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Selected treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities\nLaboratory Parameters ZEPATIER*\n\nN = 834\nn (%)\n\nALT (IU/L)\n  5.1-10.0 × ULN† (Grade 3) 6 (0.7%)\n  >10.0 × ULN (Grade 4) 6 (0.7%)\nTotal Bilirubin (mg/dL)\n  2.6-5.0 × ULN (Grade 3) 3 (0.4%)\n\n  >5.0 × ULN (Grade 4) 0\n*Based on pooled data from patients treated with ZEPATIER for 12 weeks without ribavirin\n†ULN: Upper limit of normal according to testing laboratory.\n\nSerum Late ALT elevations\n\nDuring clinical studies with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin, regardless of treatment duration, \n< 1 % (13/1,690) of subjects experienced elevations of ALT from normal levels to greater than 5 times \nthe ULN, generally at or after treatment week 8 (mean onset time 10 weeks, range 6-12 weeks). These \nlate ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic. Most late ALT elevations resolved with ongoing \ntherapy with ZEPATIER or after completion of therapy (see section 4.4). The frequency of late ALT \nelevations was higher in subjects with higher grazoprevir plasma concentration (see sections 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.2). The incidence of late ALT elevations was not affected by treatment duration. Cirrhosis was \nnot a risk factor for late ALT elevations. Less than 1% of subjects treated with ZEPATIER with or\nwithout ribavirin experienced ALT elevations >2.5 – 5 times the ULN during treatment; there were no \ntreatment discontinuations due to these ALT elevations. \n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nPaediatric population\n\nNo data are available.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of overdose with ZEPATIER is limited. The highest dose of elbasvir was 200 mg \nonce daily for 10 days, and a single dose of 800 mg. The highest dose of grazoprevir was 1,000 mg \nonce daily for 10 days, and a single dose of 1,600 mg. In these healthy volunteer studies, adverse \nreactions were similar in frequency and severity to those reported in the placebo groups.\n\nIn case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of \nadverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. \n\nHaemodialysis does not remove elbasvir or grazoprevir. Elbasvir and grazoprevir are not expected to \nbe removed by peritoneal dialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, Direct acting antivirals, Antivirals for \ntreatment of HCV infections, ATC code: J05AP54.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nZEPATIER combines two direct-acting antiviral agents with distinct mechanisms of action and non-\noverlapping resistance profiles to target HCV at multiple steps in the viral lifecycle.\n\nElbasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication and virion \nassembly. \n\nGrazoprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic \ncleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and \nNS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication. In a biochemical assay, grazoprevir inhibited the \nproteolytic activity of the recombinant NS3/4A protease enzymes from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 3 and\n4a with IC50 values ranging from 4 to 690 pM. \n\nAntiviral activity\n\nThe EC50 values of elbasvir and grazoprevir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5A \nor NS3 sequences from reference sequences and clinical isolates are presented in Table 5.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23\n\nTable 5: Activities of elbasvir and grazoprevir in GT1a, GT1b and GT4 reference sequences and \nclinical isolates in replicon cells\n\nElbasvir Grazoprevir\n\nReference EC50 nM\n\nGT1a (H77) 0.004 0.4\n\nGT1b (con 1) 0.003 0.5\n\nGT4 (ED43) 0.0003 0.3\n\nClinical Isolates Median EC50 (range) nM\n\nGT1a 0.005 (0.003 – 0.009)a 0.8 (0.4 – 5.1)d\n\nGT1b 0.009 (0.005 – 0.01)b 0.3 (0.2 – 5.9)e\n\nGT4 0.0007 (0.0002 – 34)c 0.2 (0.11 – 0.33)a\n\nNumber of isolates tested: a=5, b=4, c=14, d=10, e=9\n\nResistance\n\nIn cell culture \nHCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to elbasvir and grazoprevir have been selected in cell \nculture for genotypes 1a, 1b and 4. \n\nFor elbasvir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons, single NS5A substitutions Q30D/E/H/R, L31M/V and \nY93C/H/N reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 6- to 2,000-fold. In genotype 1b replicons, single \nNS5A substitutions L31F and Y93H reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 17-fold. In genotype 4 \nreplicons, single NS5A substitutions L30S, M31V, and Y93H reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 3-\nto 23-fold. In general, in HCV genotype 1a, 1b or 4 combinations of elbasvir resistance-associated \nsubstitutions further reduced elbasvir antiviral activity.\n\nFor grazoprevir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons, single NS3 substitutions D168A/E/G/S/V reduced \ngrazoprevir antiviral activity by 2- to 81-fold. In genotype 1b replicons, single NS3 substitutions \nF43S, A156S/T/V, and D168A/G/V reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity by 3- to 375-fold. In \ngenotype 4 replicons, single NS3 substitutions D168A/V reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity by 110-\nto 320-fold. In general, in HCV genotype 1a, 1b or 4 replicons, combinations of grazoprevir \nresistance-associated substitutions further reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity.\n\nIn clinical studies\nIn a pooled analysis of subjects treated with regimens containing elbasvir/grazoprevir or elbasvir + \ngrazoprevir with or without ribavirin in Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, resistance analyses were \nconducted for 50 subjects who experienced virologic failure and had sequence data available (6 with \non-treatment virologic failure, 44 with post-treatment relapse). \n\nTreatment-emergent substitutions observed in the viral populations of these subjects based on \ngenotypes are shown in Table 6. Treatment-emergent substitutions were detected in both HCV drug \ntargets in 23/37 (62 %) genotype 1a, 1/8 (13 %) genotype 1b and 2/5 (40 %) genotype 4 subjects.\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nTable 6: Treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in the pooled analysis of ZEPATIER\nwith and without ribavirin regimens in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies\n\nTarget Emergent Amino Acid \nSubstitutions\n\nGenotype 1a\nN = 37\n% (n)\n\nGenotype 1b\nN = 8\n% (n)\n\nGenotype 4\nN = 5\n% (n)\n\nNS5A Any of the following NS5A \nsubstitutions: M/L28A/G/T/S* \nQ30H/K/R/Y, L/M31F/M/I/V, \nH/P58D, Y93H/N/S \n\n81% (30) 88% (7) 100% (5)\n\nM/L28A/G/T/S 19% (7) 13% (1) 60% (3)\n\nQ30H/K/Y 14% (5) -- --\n\nQ30R 46% (17) -- --\n\nL/M31M/F/I/V† 11% (4) 25% (2) 40% (2)\n\nH/P58D‡ 5% (3) -- 20% (1)\n\nY93H/N/S 14% (5) 63% (5) 20% (1)\n\nNS3 Any of the following NS3 \nsubstitutions: V36L/M, Y56F/H,\nV107I, R155I/K, A156G/M/T/V, \nV158A, D168A/C/E/G/N/V/Y, \nV170I\n\n78% (29) 25% (2) 40% (2)\n\nV36L/M 11% (4) -- --\n\nY56F/H 14% (5) 13% (1) --\n\nV107I 3% (1) 13% (1) --\n\nR155I/K 5% (2) -- --\n\nA156T 27% (10) 13% (1) 20% (1)\n\nA156G/V/M 8% (3) -- 60% (3)\n\nV158A 5% (2) -- --\n\nD168A 35% (13) -- 20% (1)\n\nD168C/E/G/N/V/Y 14% (5) -- 20% (1)\n\nV170I -- -- 20% (1)\n*Reference sequences for NS5A at amino acid 28 are M (genotype 1a) and L (genotype 1b and genotype 4a and \n4d).\n†Reference sequences for NS5A at amino acid 31 are L (genotype 1a and genotype 1b) and M (genotype 4a and \n4d).\n‡Reference sequences for NS5A at amino acid 58 are H (genotype 1a) and P (genotype 1b and genotype 4a and \n4d).\n\nCross-resistance\n\nElbasvir is active in vitro against genotype 1a NS5A substitutions, M28V and Q30L, genotype 1b \nsubstitutions, L28M/V, R30Q, L31V, Y93C, and genotype 4 substitution, M31V, which confer \nresistance to other NS5A inhibitors. In general, other NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to \nNS5A inhibitors may also confer resistance to elbasvir. NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to \nelbasvir may reduce the antiviral activity of other NS5A inhibitors. \n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nGrazoprevir is active in vitro against the following genotype 1a NS3 substitutions which confer \nresistance to other NS3/4A protease inhibitors: V36A/L/M, Q41R, F43L, T54A/S, V55A/I, Y56F, \nQ80K/R, V107I, S122A/G/R/T, I132V, R155K, A156S, D168N/S, I170T/V. Grazoprevir is active in \nvitro against the following genotype 1b NS3 substitutions conferring resistance to other NS3/4A\nprotease inhibitors: V36A/I/L/M, Q41L/R, F43S, T54A/C/G/S, V55A/I, Y56F, Q80L/R, V107I,\nS122A/G/R, R155E/K/N/Q/S, A156G/S, D168E/N/S, V170A/I/T. Some NS3 substitutions at A156 \nand at D168 confer reduced antiviral activity to grazoprevir as well as to other NS3/4A protease \ninhibitors. \n\nThe substitutions associated with resistance to NS5B inhibitors do not affect the activity of elbasvir or \ngrazoprevir.\n\nPersistence of resistance-associated substitutions \n\nThe persistence of elbasvir and grazoprevir treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in NS5A, and\nNS3, respectively, was assessed in genotype 1-infected subjects in Phase 2 and 3 studies whose virus \nhad treatment-emergent resistance-associated substitution in the drug target, and with available data \nthrough at least 24 weeks post-treatment using population (or Sanger) sequencing. \n\nViral populations with treatment-emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions were generally \nmore persistent than NS3 resistance associated substitutions. Among genotype 1a-infected subjects, \nNS5A resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels at follow-up week 12 in 95% \n(35/37) of subjects and in 100% (9/9) of subjects with follow-up week 24 data.

grazoprevir peak plasma \nconcentrations occur at a median Tmax of 2 hours (range of 30 minutes to 3 hours). For elbasvir, the \nabsolute bioavailability is estimated to be 32%. For grazoprevir, the absolute bioavailability after a \n200 mg single dose ranged from 15 – 27% and after multiple 200 mg doses ranged from 20 – 40%.\n\nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of elbasvir/grazoprevir with a high-\nfat (900 kcal, 500 kcal from fat) meal to healthy subjects resulted in decreases in elbasvir AUC0-inf and \nCmax of approximately 11 % and 15 %, respectively, and increases in grazoprevir AUC0-inf and Cmax of \napproximately 1.5-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. These differences in elbasvir and grazoprevir \nexposure are not clinically relevant; therefore, elbasvir/grazoprevir may be taken without regard to \nfood.\n\nElbasvir pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HCV-infected subjects. Grazoprevir oral \nexposures are approximately 2-fold greater in HCV-infected subjects as compared to healthy subjects.\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic modeling in non-cirrhotic, HCV-infected subjects, the \ngeometric mean steady-state elbasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax at 50 mg were 2,180 nM•hr and 137 nM,\nrespectively, and the geometric mean steady-state grazoprevir AUC0-24 and Cmax at 100 mg were \n1,860 nM•hr and 220 nM, respectively. Following once daily administration of elbasvir/grazoprevir to \nHCV-infected subjects, elbasvir and grazoprevir reached steady state within approximately 6 days.\n\nDistribution\n\nElbasvir and grazoprevir are extensively bound (> 99.9 % and 98.8 %, respectively) to human plasma \nproteins. Both elbasvir and grazoprevir bind to human serum albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein.\nPlasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\n\nElimination\n\nThe geometric mean apparent terminal half-life (% geometric mean coefficient of variation) is \napproximately 24 (24 %) hours at 50 mg elbasvir and approximately 31 (34 %) hours at 100 mg \ngrazoprevir in HCV-infected subjects. \n\nMetabolism\n\nElbasvir and grazoprevir are partially eliminated by oxidative metabolism, primarily by CYP3A. No \ncirculating metabolites of either elbasvir or grazoprevir were detected in human plasma.\n\nExcretion\n\nThe primary route of elimination of elbasvir and grazoprevir is through faeces with almost all \n(> 90 %) of the radiolabeled dose recovered in faeces compared to < 1 % in urine.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nElbasvir pharmacokinetics were approximately dose-proportional over the range of 5-100 mg once \ndaily. Grazoprevir pharmacokinetics increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner over the \nrange of 10-800 mg once daily in HCV-infected subjects.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nRenal impairment\nIn non-HCV-infected subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who were \nnot on dialysis, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUC values were increased by 86 % and 65 %, respectively, \ncompared to non-HCV-infected subjects with normal renal function (eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). In \nnon-HCV-infected subjects with dialysis-dependent, severe renal impairment, elbasvir and grazoprevir \nAUC values were unchanged compared to subjects with normal renal function. Concentrations of\nelbasvir were not quantifiable in the dialysate samples. Less than 0.5 % of grazoprevir was recovered \nin dialysate over a 4-hour dialysis session.\n\nIn population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs were \n25 % and 10 % higher, respectively, in dialysis-dependent patients and 46 % and 40 % higher, \nrespectively, in non-dialysis-dependent patients with severe renal impairment compared to elbasvir \nand grazoprevir AUC in patients without severe renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn non-HCV-infected subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A [CP-A], score of 5-6), \nelbasvir AUC0-inf was decreased by 40% and grazoprevir steady-state AUC0-24 was increased 70 % \ncompared to matched healthy subjects.\n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\nIn non-HCV-infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B [CP-B], score of 7-9), \nand severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C [CP-C], score of 10-15) elbasvir AUC decreased by \n28 % and 12%, respectively, while the grazoprevir steady-state AUC0-24 was increased 5-fold and \n12-fold respectively, compared to matched healthy subjects (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n\nPopulation PK analyses of HCV-infected patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies demonstrated that \ngrazoprevir steady-state AUC0-24 increased by approximately 65 % in HCV-infected patients with \ncompensated cirrhosis (all with CP-A) compared to HCV-infected non-cirrhotic patients, while \nelbasvir steady-state AUC was similar (see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of elbasvir/grazoprevir in paediatric patients less than 18 years of age have not \nbeen established (see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\nIn population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 16 % and \n45 % higher, respectively, in subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared to subjects less than 65 years of age.\nThese changes are not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is \nrecommended based on age (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nGender\nIn population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 50 % and \n30 % higher, respectively, in females compared to males. These changes are not clinically relevant; \ntherefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended based on sex (see section 4.4).\n\nWeight/BMI\nIn population pharmacokinetic analyses, there was no effect of weight on elbasvir pharmacokinetics. \nGrazoprevir AUC is estimated to be 15 % higher in a 53 kg subject compared to a 77 kg subject. This \nchange is not clinically relevant for grazoprevir. Therefore, no dose adjustment of \nelbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended based on weight/BMI (see section 4.4).\n\nRace/Ethnicity\nIn population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 15 % and \n50 % higher, respectively, for Asians compared to Whites. Population pharmacokinetics estimates of \nexposure of elbasvir and grazoprevir were comparable between Whites and Black/African Americans.\nThese changes are not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is \nrecommended based on race/ethnicity (see section 4.4).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development \nwith grazoprevir or elbasvir. Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures \nconsidered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to \nclinical use. Carcinogenicity studies for grazoprevir and elbasvir have not been conducted.\n\nEmbryo fetal and post natal development\n\nElbasvir\nElbasvir was given to rats and rabbits without eliciting adverse effects on embryofetal or post natal \ndevelopment at up to the highest doses tested (approximately 9- and 17-fold above human exposure in \nrats and rabbits, respectively). Elbasvir has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. \nElbasvir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with concentrations 4-fold that of the maternal \nplasma concentrations.\n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\nGrazoprevir\nGrazoprevir was given to rats and rabbits without eliciting adverse effects on embryofetal or post natal \ndevelopment at up to highest doses tested (approximately 79- and 39-fold above human exposure in \nrats and rabbits, respectively). Grazoprevir has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. \nGrazoprevir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with concentrations < 1-fold of the maternal \nplasma concentrations.\n\n6.

The active substances in the medicine work together by \nblocking two different proteins that the hepatitis C virus needs to grow and reproduce. This allows the \ninfection to be permanently removed from the body. \n\nZEPATIER is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin.\n\nIt is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with\nZEPATIER. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n2.
