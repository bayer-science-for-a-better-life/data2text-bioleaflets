CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNeuropathic pain \nPregabalin Zentiva k.s. is indicated for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in \nadults. \n \nEpilepsy \nPregabalin Zentiva k.s. is indicated as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without \nsecondary generalisation. \n \nGeneralised anxiety disorder \nPregabalin Zentiva k.s. is indicated for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given in either two or three divided doses. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nNeuropathic pain \n\nPregabalin treatment can be started at a dose of 150 mg per day given as two or three divided doses. \nBased on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day \nafter an interval of 3 to 7 days, and if needed, to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day after \nan additional 7-day interval. \n \n\nEpilepsy \n\nPregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150 mg per day given as two or three divided doses. \nBased on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day \nafter 1 week. The maximum dose of 600 mg per day may be achieved after an additional week. \n \nGeneralised anxiety disorder \n\nThe dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given as two or three divided doses. The need for treatment \nshould be reassessed regularly. Pregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150 mg per day. \nBased on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day \nafter 1 week. Following an additional week the dose may be increased to 450 mg per day. \nThe maximum dose of 600 mg per day may be achieved after an additional week. \n \nDiscontinuation of pregabalin \n\nIn accordance with current clinical practice, if pregabalin has to be discontinued it is recommended \nthis should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week independent of the indication (see sections \n4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nPregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. \nAs pregabalin clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see section 5.2), dose \nreduction in patients with compromised renal function must be individualised according to creatinine \nclearance (CLcr), as indicated in table 1 determined using the following formula. \n \n \n \nPregabalin is removed effectively from plasma by haemodialysis (50% of drug in 4 hours). \nFor patients receiving haemodialysis, the pregabalin daily dose should be adjusted based on renal \nfunction. In addition to the daily dose, a supplementary dose should be given immediately following \nevery 4 hour haemodialysis treatment (see table 1). \n \nTable 1. Pregabalin dose adjustment based on renal function \n \n\nCreatinine clearance (CLcr) \n(ml/min) \n\nTotal pregabalin daily dose * Dose regimen \n\n Starting dose \n(mg/day) \n\nMaximum dose \n(mg/day) \n\n \n\n≥ 60 150 600 BID or TID \n≥30 – <60 75 300 BID or TID \n≥15 – <30 25 – 50 150 Once daily or BID \n< 15 25 75 Once daily \nSupplementary dosage following haemodialysis (mg) \n 25 100 Single dose + \n\nTID = Three divided doses. \nBID = Two divided doses. \n* Total daily dose (mg/day) should be divided as indicated by dose regimen to provide mg/dose. \n+ Supplementary dose is a single additional dose. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \n\nCLcr (ml/min) =  (× 0.85 for female patients) 1.23 × [140 - age (years)] × weight (kg) serum creatinine (µmol/l) \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pregabalin in children below the age of 12 years and in adolescents (12 – 17 \nyears of age) have not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and \n5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nElderly \n\nElderly patients may require a dose reduction of pregabalin due to a decreased renal function \n(see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nPregabalin Zentiva k.s. may be taken with or without food. \nPregabalin Zentiva k.s. is for oral use only. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDiabetic patients \nIn accordance with current clinical practice, some diabetic patients who gain weight on pregabalin \ntreatment may need to adjust hypoglycaemic medicinal products. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nThere have been reports in the post-marketing experience of hypersensitivity reactions, including \ncases of angioedema. Pregabalin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, \nsuch as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. \n \nDizziness, somnolence, loss of consciousness, confusion, and mental impairment \nPregabalin treatment has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which could increase \nthe occurrence of accidental injury (fall) in the elderly population. There have also been post-\nmarketing reports of loss of consciousness, confusion and mental impairment. Therefore, patients \nshould be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicinal \nproduct. \n \nVision-related effects \nIn controlled trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred vision than \ndid patients treated with placebo which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. \nIn the clinical studies where ophthalmologic testing was conducted, the incidence of visual acuity \nreduction and visual field changes was greater in pregabalin-treated patients than in placebo-treated \npatients; the incidence of fundoscopic changes was greater in placebo-treated patients (see section \n5.1). \nIn the post-marketing experience, visual adverse reactions have also been reported, including loss \nof vision, visual blurring or other changes of visual acuity, many of which were transient. \nDiscontinuation of pregabalin may result in resolution or improvement of these visual symptoms. \n \nRenal failure \nCases of renal failure have been reported and in some cases discontinuation of pregabalin did show \nreversibility of this adverse reaction. \n \nWithdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products \nThere are insufficient data for the withdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products, once \nseizure control with pregabalin in the add-on situation has been reached, in order to reach \nmonotherapy on pregabalin. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nWithdrawal symptoms \nAfter discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with pregabalin withdrawal symptoms \nhave been observed in some patients. The following events have been mentioned: insomnia, headache, \nnausea, anxiety, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, nervousness, depression, pain, convulsion, hyperhidrosis and \ndizziness, suggestive of physical dependence. The patient should be informed about this at the start \nof the treatment. \nConvulsions, including status epilepticus and grand mal convulsions, may occur during pregabalin use \nor shortly after discontinuing pregabalin. \nConcerning discontinuation of long-term treatment of pregabalin data suggest that the incidence and \nseverity of withdrawal symptoms may be dose-related. \n \nCongestive heart failure \nThere have been post-marketing reports of congestive heart failure in some patients receiving \npregabalin. These reactions are mostly seen in elderly cardiovascular compromised patients during \npregabalin treatment for a neuropathic indication. Pregabalin should be used with caution in these \npatients. Discontinuation of pregabalin may resolve the reaction. \n \nTreatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury \nIn the treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury the incidence of adverse reactions \nin general, central nervous system adverse reactions and especially somnolence was increased. This \nmay be attributed to an additive effect due to concomitant medicinal products (e.g. anti-spasticity \nagents) needed for this condition. This should be considered when prescribing pregabalin in this \ncondition. \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents \nin several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled studies of anti-epileptic \ndrugs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of this \nrisk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for \npregabalin. \nTherefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nReduced lower gastrointestinal tract function \nThere are post-marketing reports of events related to reduced lower gastrointestinal tract function \n(e.g. intestinal obstruction, paralytic ileus, constipation) when pregabalin was co-administered with \nmedications that have the potential to produce constipation, such as opioid analgesics. When \npregabalin and opioids will be used in combination, measures to prevent constipation may \nbe considered (especially in female patients and elderly). \n \nConcomitant use with opioids \nCaution is advised when prescribing pregabalin concomitantly with opioids due to risk of CNS \ndepression (see section 4.5). In a case-control study of opioid users, those patients who took \npregabalin concomitantly with an opioid had an increased risk for opioid-related death compared to \nopioid use alone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.68 [95% CI, 1.19 – 2.36]). This increased risk was \nobserved at low doses of pregabalin (≤ 300 mg, aOR 1.52 [95% CI, 1.04 – 2.22]) and there was a trend \nfor a greater risk at high doses of pregabalin (> 300 mg, aOR 2.51 [95% CI 1.24 – 5.06]). \n \nMisuse, abuse potential or dependence \nCases of misuse, abuse and dependence have been reported. Caution should be exercised in patients \nwith a history of substance abuse and the patient should be monitored for symptoms of pregabalin \nmisuse, abuse or dependence (development of tolerance, dose escalation, drug-seeking behaviour have \nbeen reported). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nEncephalopathy \nCases of encephalopathy have been reported, mostly in patients with underlying conditions that may \nprecipitate encephalopathy. \n \nLactose intolerance \nPregabalin Zentiva k.s. contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems \nof galactose intolerance, the total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not \ntake this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSince pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism \nin humans (< 2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibit drug metabolism \nin vitro, and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, \npharmacokinetic interactions. \n \nIn vivo studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis \nAccordingly, in in vivo studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed \nbetween pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, lorazepam, \noxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that oral antidiabetics, diuretics, \ninsulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine and topiramate had no clinically significant effect on pregabalin \nclearance. \n \nOral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol \nCo-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol \ndoes not influence the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either substance. \n \nCentral nervous system influencing medical products \nPregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and lorazepam. \n \nIn the post-marketing experience, there are reports of respiratory failure, coma and deaths in patients \ntaking pregabalin and opioids and/or other central nervous system (CNS) depressant medicinal \nproducts. Pregabalin appears to be additive in the impairment of cognitive and gross motor function \ncaused by oxycodone. \n \nInteractions and the elderly \nNo specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted in elderly volunteers. Interaction \nstudies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nAs the potential risk for humans is unknown, effective contraception must be used in women of child \nbearing potential. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of pregabalin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nPregabalin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother \nclearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). \n \nBreast-feeding \nPregabalin is excreted into human milk (see section 5.2). The effect of pregabalin on newborns/infants \nis unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue \npregabalin therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit \nof therapy for the woman. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFertility \nThere are no clinical data on the effects of pregabalin on female fertility. \nIn a clinical trial to assess the effect of pregabalin on sperm motility, healthy male subjects were \nexposed to pregabalin at a dose of 600 mg/day. After 3 months of treatment, there were no effects \non sperm motility. \nA fertility study in female rats has shown adverse reproductive effects. Fertility studies in male rats \nhave shown adverse reproductive and developmental effects. The clinical relevance of these findings \nis unknown (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPregabalin may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Pregabalin \nmay cause dizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the ability to drive or use machines. \nPatients are advised not to drive, operate complex machinery or engage in other potentially hazardous \nactivities until it is known whether this medicinal product affects their ability to perform these \nactivities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe pregabalin clinical programme involved over 8,900 patients exposed to pregabalin, of whom over \n5,600 were in double-blind placebo controlled trials. The most commonly reported adverse reactions \nwere dizziness and somnolence. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity. In all \ncontrolled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12% for patients receiving \npregabalin and 5% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting \nin discontinuation from pregabalin treatment groups were dizziness and somnolence. \nIn table 2 below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo and in more \nthan one patient, are listed by class and frequency: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 \nto < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \nThe adverse reactions listed may also be associated with the underlying disease and/or concomitant \nmedicinal products. \nIn the treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury the incidence of adverse reactions  \nin general, CNS adverse reactions and especially somnolence was increased (see section 4.4). \nAdditional reactions reported from post-marketing experience are included in italics in the list below. \n \nTable 2: Pregabalin Adverse Drug Reactions \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse drug reactions \nInfections and infestations \nCommon Nasopharyngitis \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon Neutropaenia \nImmune system disorders \nUncommon Hypersensitivity \nRare Angioedema, allergic reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon Appetite increased \nUncommon Anorexia, hypoglycaemia \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon Euphoric mood, confusion, irritability, disorientation, \n\ninsomnia, libido decreased \nUncommon Hallucination, panic attack, restlessness, agitation, \n\ndepression, depressed mood, elevated mood, aggression, \nmood swings, depersonalisation, word finding difficulty, \nabnormal dreams, libido increased, anorgasmia, apathy \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse drug reactions \nRare Disinhibition \nNervous system disorders \nVery common Dizziness, somnolence, headache \nCommon Ataxia, coordination abnormal, tremor, dysarthria, \n\namnesia, memory impairment, disturbance in attention, \nparaesthesia, hypoaesthesia, sedation, balance disorder, \nlethargy \n\nUncommon Syncope, stupor, myoclonus, loss of consciousness, \npsychomotor hyperactivity, dyskinesia, dizziness \npostural, intention tremor, nystagmus, cognitive \ndisorder, mental impairment, speech disorder, \nhyporeflexia, hyperaesthesia, burning sensation, \nageusia, malaise \n\nRare Convulsions, parosmia, hypokinesia, dysgraphia \nEye disorders \nCommon Vision blurred, diplopia \nUncommon Peripheral vision loss, visual disturbance, eye swelling, \n\nvisual field defect, visual acuity reduced, eye pain, \nasthenopia, photopsia, dry eye, lacrimation increased, \neye irritation \n\nRare Vision loss, keratitis, oscillopsia, altered visual depth \nperception, mydriasis, strabismus, visual brightness \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon Vertigo \nUncommon Hyperacusis \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon Tachycardia, atrioventricular block first degree, sinus \n\nbradycardia, congestive heart failure \nRare QT prolongation, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia \nVascular disorders \nUncommon Hypotension, hypertension, hot flushes, flushing, \n\nperipheral coldness \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon Dyspnoea, epistaxis, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, \n\nsnoring, nasal dryness \nRare Pulmonary oedema, throat tightness \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon Vomiting, nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, \n\nabdominal distension, dry mouth \nUncommon Gastrooesophageal reflux disease, salivary \n\nhypersecretion, hypoaesthesia oral \nRare Ascites, pancreatitis, swollen tongue, dysphagia \nHepatobiliary disorders \nUncommon Elevated liver enzymes* \nRare Jaundice \nVery rare Hepatic failure, hepatitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon Rash papular, urticaria, hyperhidrosis, pruritus \nRare Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cold sweat \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon Muscle cramp, arthralgia, back pain, pain in limb, \n\ncervical spasm \nUncommon Joint swelling, myalgia, muscle twitching, neck pain, \n\nmuscle stiffness \nRare Rhabdomyolysis \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse drug reactions \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon Urinary incontinence, dysuria \nRare Renal failure, oliguria, urinary retention \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon Erectile dysfunction \nUncommon Sexual dysfunction, ejaculation delayed, \n\ndysmenorrhoea, breast pain \nRare Amenorrhoea, breast discharge, breast enlargement, \n\ngynaecomastia \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon Oedema peripheral, oedema, gait abnormal, fall, feeling \n\ndrunk, feeling abnormal, fatigue \nUncommon Generalised oedema, face oedema, chest tightness, pain, \n\npyrexia, thirst, chills, asthenia \nInvestigations \nCommon Weight increased \nUncommon Blood creatine phosphokinase increased, blood glucose \n\nincreased, platelet count decreased, blood creatinine \nincreased, blood potassium decreased, weight decreased \n\nRare White blood cell count decreased \n* Alanine aminotransferase increased (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase increased (AST). \n \nAfter discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with pregabalin withdrawal symptoms \nhave been observed in some patients. The following reactions have been mentioned: insomnia, \nheadache, nausea, anxiety, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, convulsions, nervousness, depression, pain, \nhyperhidrosis and dizziness, suggestive of physical dependence. The patient should be informed about \nthis at the start of the treatment. \nConcerning discontinuation of long-term treatment of pregabalin, data suggest that the incidence and \nseverity of withdrawal symptoms may be dose-related. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe pregabalin safety profile observed in four paediatric studies in patients with partial seizures \nwith or without secondary generalisation (12-week efficacy and safety study in patients \n4 to 16 years of age, n = 295; 14-day efficacy and safety study in patients 1 month to younger \nthan 4 years of age, n = 175; pharmacokinetic and tolerability study, n = 65; and 1 year open \nlabel follow on safety study, n = 54) was similar to that observed in the adult studies of patients \nwith epilepsy. The most common adverse events observed in the 12-week study with pregabalin \ntreatment were somnolence, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, increased appetite, weight \nincreased, and nasopharyngitis. The most common adverse events observed in the 14-day study \nwith pregabalin treatment were somnolence, upper respiratory tract infection, and pyrexia (see \nsections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the post-marketing experience, the most commonly reported adverse reactions observed when \npregabalin was taken in overdose included somnolence, confusional state, agitation, and restlessness. \nSeizures were also reported. \nIn rare occasions, cases of coma have been reported. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nTreatment of pregabalin overdose should include general supportive measures and may include \nhaemodialysis if necessary (see section 4.2 table 1). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-epileptics, other anti-epileptics; \nATC code: N03AX16. \n \nThe active substance, pregabalin, is a gamma-aminobutyric acid analogue [(S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-\nmethylhexanoic acid]. \n \nMechanism of action \nPregabalin binds to an auxiliary subunit (α2-δ protein) of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central \nnervous system. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nNeuropathic pain \n\nEfficacy has been shown in trials in diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia and spinal cord \ninjury. Efficacy has not been studied in other models of neuropathic pain. \n \nPregabalin has been studied in 10 controlled clinical trials of up to 13 weeks with twice a day dosing \n(BID) and up to 8 weeks with three times a day (TID) dosing. Overall, the safety and efficacy profiles \nfor BID and TID dosing regimens were similar. \n \nIn clinical trials up to 12 weeks for both peripheral and central neuropathic pain, a reduction in pain \nwas seen by week 1 and was maintained throughout the treatment period. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials in peripheral neuropathic pain 35% of the pregabalin treated patients and \n18% of the patients on placebo had a 50% improvement in pain score. For patients not experiencing \nsomnolence, such an improvement was observed in 33% of patients treated with pregabalin and 18% \nof patients on placebo. For patients who experienced somnolence the responder rates were 48% \non pregabalin and 16% on placebo. \n \nIn the controlled clinical trial in central neuropathic pain 22% of the pregabalin treated patients and \n7% of the patients on placebo had a 50% improvement in pain score. \n \nEpilepsy \n\nAdjunctive treatment \nPregabalin has been studied in 3 controlled clinical trials of 12 week duration with either BID or TID \ndosing. Overall, the safety and efficacy profiles for BID and TID dosing regimens were similar. \nA reduction in seizure frequency was observed by Week 1. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe efficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive treatment for epilepsy in paediatric patients below \nthe age of 12 and adolescents has not been established. The adverse events observed in a \npharmacokinetic and tolerability study that enrolled patients from 3 months to 16 years of age (n = 65) \nwith partial onset seizures were similar to those observed in adults. Results of a 12-week placebo \ncontrolled study of 295 paediatric patients aged 4 to 16 years and a 14-day placebo-controlled study \nof 175 paediatric patients aged 1 month to younger than 4 years of age performed to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures and a \n1 year open label safety study in 54 paediatric patients from 3 months to 16 years of age with epilepsy \nindicate that the adverse events of pyrexia and upper respiratory infections were observed more \nfrequently than in adult studies of patients with epilepsy (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn the 12-week placebo controlled study, paediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age) were assigned to \npregabalin 2.5 mg/kg/day (maximum, 150 mg/day), pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (maximum, \n600 mg/day), or placebo. The percentage of subjects with at least a 50% reduction in partial onset \nseizures as compared to baseline was 40.6% of subjects treated with pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day \n(p = 0.0068 versus placebo), 29.1% of subjects treated with pregabalin 2.5 mg/kg/day \n(p = 0.2600 versus placebo) and 22.6% of those receiving placebo. \nIn the 14-day placebo-controlled study, paediatric patients (1 month to younger than 4 years of age) \nwere assigned to pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day, pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, or placebo. Median 24-hour \nseizure frequencies at baseline and at the final visit were 4.7 and 3.8 for pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day, \n5.4 and 1.4 for pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, and 2.9 and 2.3 for placebo, respectively. Pregabalin \n14 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the log-transformed partial onset seizure frequency versus placebo \n(p=0.0223); pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day did not show improvement relative to placebo. \n \nMonotherapy (newly diagnosed patients) \nPregabalin has been studied in 1 controlled clinical trial of 56 week duration with BID dosing. \nPregabalin did not achieve non-inferiority to lamotrigine based on the 6-month seizure freedom \nendpoint. Pregabalin and lamotrigine were similarly safe and well tolerated. \n \nGeneralised anxiety disorder \n\nPregabalin has been studied in 6 controlled trials of 4 – 6 week duration, an elderly study of 8 week \nduration and a long-term relapse prevention study with a double blind relapse prevention phase \nof 6 months duration. \nRelief of the symptoms of GAD as reflected by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) was \nobserved by Week 1. \nIn controlled clinical trials (4 – 8 week duration) 52% of the pregabalin treated patients and 38% \nof the patients on placebo had at least a 50% improvement in HAM-A total score from baseline \nto endpoint. \nIn controlled trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred vision than \ndid patients treated with placebo which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. \nOphthalmologic testing (including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing and dilated \nfunduscopic examination) was conducted in over 3600 patients within controlled clinical trials. \nIn these patients, visual acuity was reduced in 6.5% of patients treated with pregabalin, and 4.8% \nof placebo-treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 12.4% of pregabalin-treated, \nand 11.7% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 1.7% of pregabalin-\ntreated and 2.1% of placebo-treated patients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPregabalin steady-state pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy volunteers, patients with epilepsy \nreceiving anti-epileptic drugs and patients with chronic pain. \n \nAbsorption \nPregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered in the fasted state, with peak plasma concentrations \noccurring within 1 hour following both single and multiple dose administration. Pregabalin oral \nbioavailability is estimated to be ≥ 90% and is independent of dose. Following repeated \nadministration, steady state is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. The rate of pregabalin absorption \nis decreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in Cmax by approximately 25 – 30% and \na delay in tmax to approximately 2.5 hours. However, administration of pregabalin with food has \nno clinically significant effect on the extent of pregabalin absorption. \n \nDistribution \nIn preclinical studies, pregabalin has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in mice, rats, and \nmonkeys. Pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk of lactating \nrats. In humans, the apparent volume of distribution of pregabalin following oral administration \nis approximately 0.56 l/kg. Pregabalin is not bound to plasma proteins. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nBiotransformation \nPregabalin undergoes negligible metabolism in humans. Following a dose of radiolabelled pregabalin, \napproximately 98% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was unchanged pregabalin. \nThe N- methylated derivative of pregabalin, the major metabolite of pregabalin found in urine, \naccounted for 0.9% of the dose. In preclinical studies, there was no indication of racemisation \nof pregabalin S-enantiomer to the R-enantiomer. \n \nElimination \nPregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. \nPregabalin mean elimination half-life is 6.3 hours. Pregabalin plasma clearance and renal clearance are \ndirectly proportional to creatinine clearance (see section 5.2 Renal impairment). \nDose adjustment in patients with reduced renal function or undergoing haemodialysis is necessary \n(see section 4.2 table 1). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics are linear over the recommended daily dose range. Inter-subject \npharmacokinetic variability for pregabalin is low (< 20%). Multiple dose pharmacokinetics \nare predictable from single-dose data. Therefore, there is no need for routine monitoring of plasma \nconcentrations of pregabalin. \n \nGender \nClinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma \nconcentrations of pregabalin. \n \nRenal impairment \nPregabalin clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. In addition, pregabalin \nis effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis (following a 4 hour haemodialysis treatment \nplasma pregabalin concentrations are reduced by approximately 50%). Because renal elimination is \nthe major elimination pathway, dose reduction in patients with renal impairment and dose \nsupplementation following haemodialysis is necessary (see section 4.2 table 1). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo specific pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in patients with impaired liver function. Since \npregabalin does not undergo significant metabolism and is excreted predominantly as unchanged drug \nin the urine, impaired liver function would not be expected to significantly alter pregabalin plasma \nconcentrations. \n \nPaediatric population \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics were evaluated in paediatric patients with epilepsy (age groups: 1 to 23 \nmonths, 2 to 6 years, 7 to 11 years and 12 to 16 years) at dose levels of 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day \nin a pharmacokinetic and tolerability study. \n \nAfter oral administration of pregabalin in paediatric patients in the fasted state, in general, time \nto reach peak plasma concentration was similar across the entire age group and occurred 0.5 hours to 2 \nhours postdose. \n \nPregabalin Cmax and AUC parameters increased in a linear manner with increasing dose within each \nage group. The AUC was lower by 30% in paediatric patients below a weight of 30 kg due \nto an increased body weight adjusted clearance of 43% for these patients in comparison to patients \nweighing ≥ 30 kg. \n \nPregabalin terminal half-life averaged about 3 to 4 hours in paediatric patients up to 6 years of age, \nand 4 to 6 hours in those 7 years of age and older. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed that creatinine clearance was a significant covariate \nof pregabalin oral clearance, body weight was a significant covariate of pregabalin apparent oral \nvolume of distribution, and these relationships were similar in paediatric and adult patients. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics in patients younger than 3 months old have not been studied (see sections \n4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nElderly \nPregabalin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age. This decrease in pregabalin oral clearance \nis consistent with decreases in creatinine clearance associated with increasing age. Reduction \nof pregabalin dose may be required in patients who have age related compromised renal function \n(see section 4.2 table 1). \n \nBreast-feeding mothers \nThe pharmacokinetics of 150 mg pregabalin given every 12 hours (300 mg daily dose) was evaluated \nin 10 lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum. Lactation had little to no influence \non pregabalin pharmacokinetics. Pregabalin was excreted into breast milk with average steady-state \nconcentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated infant dose from breast \nmilk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 ml/kg/day) of women receiving 300 mg/day or the \nmaximum dose of 600 mg/day would be 0.31 or 0.62 mg/kg/day, respectively. These estimated doses \nare approximately 7% of the total daily maternal dose on a mg/kg basis. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn conventional safety pharmacology studies in animals, pregabalin was well-tolerated at clinically \nrelevant doses. In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys CNS effects were observed, \nincluding hypoactivity, hyperactivity and ataxia. An increased incidence of retinal atrophy commonly \nobserved in aged albino rats was seen after long-term exposure to pregabalin at exposures ≥ 5 times \nthe mean human exposure at the maximum recommended clinical dose. \nPregabalin was not teratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits. Foetal toxicity in rats and rabbits occurred only \nat exposures sufficiently above human exposure. In prenatal/postnatal toxicity studies, pregabalin \ninduced offspring developmental toxicity in rats at exposures > 2 times the maximum recommended \nhuman exposure. \nAdverse effects on fertility in male and female rats were only observed at exposures sufficiently \nin excess of therapeutic exposure. Adverse effects on male reproductive organs and sperm parameters \nwere reversible and occurred only at exposures sufficiently in excess of therapeutic exposure or were \nassociated with spontaneous degenerative processes in male reproductive organs in the rat. Therefore \nthe effects were considered of little or no clinical relevance. \nPregabalin is not genotoxic based on results of a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \nTwo-year carcinogenicity studies with pregabalin were conducted in rats and mice. No tumours were \nobserved in rats at exposures up to 24 times the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended \nclinical dose of 600 mg/day. In mice, no increased incidence of tumours was found at exposures \nsimilar to the mean human exposure, but an increased incidence of haemangiosarcoma was observed \nat higher exposures. The non-genotoxic mechanism of pregabalin-induced tumour formation in mice \ninvolves platelet changes and associated endothelial cell proliferation. These platelet changes were not \npresent in rats or in humans based on short-term and limited long-term clinical data. There \nis no evidence to suggest an associated risk to humans. \nIn juvenile rats the types of toxicity do not differ qualitatively from those observed in adult rats. \nHowever, juvenile rats are more sensitive. At therapeutic exposures, there was evidence of CNS \nclinical signs of hyperactivity and bruxism and some changes in growth (transient body weight gain \nsuppression). Effects on the oestrus cycle were observed at 5-fold the human therapeutic exposure. \nReduced acoustic startle response was observed in juvenile rats 1 – 2 weeks after exposure at > 2 times \nthe human therapeutic exposure. Nine weeks after exposure, this effect was no longer observable. \n \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n6.
