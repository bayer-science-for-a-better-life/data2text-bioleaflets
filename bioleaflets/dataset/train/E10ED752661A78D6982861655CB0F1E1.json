NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTargretin 75 mg soft capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach capsule contains 75 mg of bexarotene.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: sorbitol\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSoft capsule. \n\nOff-white capsule, containing a liquid suspension and imprinted with \u201cTargretin\u201d.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTargretin is indicated for the treatment of skin manifestations of advanced stage cutaneous T-cell \nlymphoma (CTCL) in adult patients refractory to at least one systemic treatment. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nBexarotene therapy should only be initiated and maintained by physicians experienced in the treatment \nof patients with CTCL.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended initial dose is 300 mg/m2/day. Initial dose calculations according to body surface \narea are as follows:\n\nTable 1 Recommended initial dose\nInitial dose level (300 mg/m2/day) Number of 75 mg Targretin \n\ncapsulesBody Surface Area (m2) Total daily dose (mg/day)\n0.88 \u2013 1.12 300 4\n1.13 - 1.37 375 5\n1.38 - 1.62 450 6\n1.63 - 1.87 525 7\n1.88 - 2.12 600 8\n2.13 - 2.37 675 9\n2.38 - 2.62 750 10\n\nDose modification guidelines\nThe 300 mg/m2/day dose level may be adjusted to 200 mg/m2/day then to 100 mg/m2/day, or \ntemporarily suspended, if necessitated by toxicity. When toxicity is controlled, doses may be carefully \nreadjusted upward. With appropriate clinical monitoring, individual patients may benefit from doses \nabove 300 mg/m2/day. Doses greater than 650 mg/m2/day have not been evaluated in patients with \nCTCL. In clinical trials, bexarotene was administered for up to 118 weeks to patients with CTCL. \nTreatment should be continued as long as the patient is deriving benefit.\n\n\n\n3\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of bexarotene in children (aged below 18 years) have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nElderly patients\nOf the total number of patients with CTCL in clinical studies, 61% were 60 years or older, while 30% \nwere 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or \nolder and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be \nruled out. The standard dose should be used in the elderly.\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nNo formal studies have been conducted in patients with renal insufficiency. Clinical pharmacokinetic \ndata indicate that urinary elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites is a minor excretory pathway \nfor bexarotene. In all evaluated patients, the estimated renal clearance of bexarotene was less than \n1 ml/minute. In view of the limited data, patients with renal insufficiency should be monitored \ncarefully while on bexarotene therapy.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor oral use.\n\nTargretin capsules should be taken as a single oral daily dose with a meal. The capsule should not be \nchewed.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nPregnancy and lactation.\nWomen of child-bearing potential without effective birth-control measures.\nHistory of pancreatitis.\nUncontrolled hypercholesterolaemia.\nUncontrolled hypertriglyceridaemia.\nHypervitaminosis A.\nUncontrolled thyroid disease.\nHepatic insufficiency.\nOngoing systemic infection.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nTargretin capsules should be used with caution in patients with a known hypersensitivity to retinoids. \nNo clinical instances of cross-reactivity have been noted. Patients receiving bexarotene should not \ndonate blood for transfusion. Butylated hydroxyanisole, an ingredient in Targretin, may cause \nirritation to the mucous membranes, therefore the capsules must be swallowed intact and not chewed.\n\nLipids\nHyperlipidaemia has been identified as an effect associated with the use of bexarotene in clinical \nstudies. Fasting blood lipid determinations (triglycerides and cholesterol) should be performed before \nbexarotene therapy is initiated and at weekly intervals until the lipid response to bexarotene is \nestablished, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and then at intervals no less than monthly \nthereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalised with appropriate intervention prior to \nbexarotene therapy. Every attempt should be made to maintain triglyceride levels below 4.52 mmol/l \nin order to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae. If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated \nduring treatment, institution of antilipaemic therapy is recommended, and if necessary, dose \nreductions (from 300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene to 200 mg/m2/day, and if necessary to 100 mg/m2/day) \nor treatment discontinuation. Data from clinical studies indicate that bexarotene concentrations were \nnot affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin. However, concomitant administration of \n\n\n\n4\n\ngemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene and therefore, \nconcomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nElevations of serum cholesterol should be managed according to current medical practice.\n\nPancreatitis\nAcute pancreatitis associated with elevations of fasting serum triglycerides has been reported in \nclinical studies. Patients with CTCL having risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior episodes of \npancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes \nmellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated \nwith pancreatic toxicity) should not be treated with bexarotene, unless the potential benefit outweighs \nthe risk.\n\nLiver Function Test (LFT) abnormalities\nLFT elevations associated with the use of bexarotene have been reported. Based on data from ongoing \nclinical trials, elevation of LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in \ndose or discontinuation of therapy. Baseline LFTs should be obtained, and LFTs should be carefully \nmonitored weekly during the first month and then monthly thereafter. Consideration should be given \nto a suspension or discontinuation of bexarotene if test results reach greater than three times the upper \nlimit of normal values for SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, or bilirubin.\n\nThyroid function test alterations\nChanges in thyroid function tests have been observed in patients receiving bexarotene, most often \nnoted as a reversible reduction in thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored at least \nmonthly during treatment and as indicated by the emergence of symptoms consistent with \nhypothyroidism. Patients with symptomatic hypothyroidism on bexarotene therapy have been treated \nwith thyroid hormone supplements with resolution of symptoms. \n\nLeucopenia\nLeucopenia associated with bexarotene therapy has been reported in clinical studies. The majority of \ncases resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Determination of white blood cell \ncount with differential count should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first month and then \nmonthly thereafter.\n\nAnaemia\nAnaemia associated with bexarotene therapy has been reported in clinical studies. Determination of \nhaemoglobin should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first month and then monthly \nthereafter. Decreases of haemoglobin should be managed according to current medical practice.\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nDepression, depression aggravated, anxiety, and mood alterations have been reported in patients \ntreated with systemic retinoids, including bexarotene. Particular care should be taken in patients with a \nhistory of depression. Patients should be monitored for signs of depression and referred for appropriate \ntreatment if necessary. Awareness by family or friends may be useful to detect mental health \ndeterioration.\n\nLens opacities\nFollowing bexarotene treatment, some patients were observed to have previously undetected lens \nopacities or a change in pre-existing lens opacities unrelated to treatment duration or dose level of \nexposure. Given the high prevalence and natural rate of cataract formation in the older patient \npopulation represented in the clinical studies, there was no apparent association between the incidence \nof lens opacity formation and bexarotene administration. However, an adverse effect of long-term \nbexarotene treatment on lens opacity formation in humans has not been excluded. Any patient treated \nwith bexarotene who experiences visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic \nexamination.\n\n\n\n5\n\nVitamin A supplementation\nBecause of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A \nsupplements to \uf0a315,000 IU/day to avoid potential additive toxic effects. \n\nPatients with diabetes mellitus\nCaution should be exercised when administering bexarotene in patients using insulin, agents \nenhancing insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitisers (e.g. thiazolidinediones). Based \non the known mechanism of action, bexarotene may potentially enhance the action of these agents, \nresulting in hypoglycaemia. No cases of hypoglycaemia associated with the use of bexarotene as \nmonotherapy have been reported.\n\nPhotosensitivity\nThe use of some retinoids has been associated with photosensitivity. Patients should be advised to \nminimise exposure to sunlight and avoid sun lamps during therapy with bexarotene, as in vitro data \nindicate that bexarotene may potentially have a photosensitising effect. \n\nOral contraceptives\nBexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the efficacy of \noestroprogestive contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a woman of \nchildbearing potential, a reliable, non-hormonal form of contraception is also required, because \nbexarotene belongs to a therapeutic class for which the human malformative risk is high.\n\nPaediatric population\nTargretin is not recommended in children (aged below 18 years).\n\nTargretin contains a small amount of sorbitol, therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of \nfructose intolerance should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffects of other substances on bexarotene\nNo formal studies to evaluate interactions with bexarotene have been conducted. On the basis of the \noxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), coadministration with other \nCYP3A4 substrates such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, protease inhibitors, clarithromycin and \nerythromycin may theoretically lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations. Furthermore, \nco-administration with CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin, dexamethasone or \nphenobarbital may theoretically cause a reduction in plasma bexarotene concentrations.\n\nCaution is advised in case of combination with CYP3A4 substrates having a narrow therapeutic \nmargin i.e. immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) as well as \nCYP3A4-metabolised cytotoxics, i.e. cyclophosphamide, etoposide, finasteride, ifosfamide, \ntamoxifen, vinca-alcaloids.\n\nA population analysis of plasma bexarotene concentrations in patients with CTCL indicated that \nconcomitant administration of gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of \nbexarotene. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Under similar conditions, bexarotene \nconcentrations were not affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin or levothyroxine. \nConcomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended.\n\nEffects of bexarotene on other substances\nThere are indications that bexarotene may induce CYP3A4. Therefore, repeated administration of \nbexarotene may result in an auto-induction of its own metabolism and, particularly at dose levels \ngreater than 300 mg/m2/day, may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of \nother substances metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4, such as tamoxifen. For example bexarotene \nmay reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).\n\n\n\n6\n\nBexarotene may potentially enhance the action of insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g. \nsulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitisers (e.g. thiazolidinediones), resulting in hypoglycaemia (see section \n4.4).\n\nLaboratory test interactions\nCA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be accentuated with bexarotene therapy.\n\nFood interactions\nIn all clinical trials, patients were instructed to take Targretin capsules with or immediately following \na meal. In one clinical study, plasma bexarotene AUC and Cmax values were substantially higher \nfollowing the administration of a fat-containing meal versus those following the administration of a \nglucose solution. Because safety and efficacy data from clinical trials are based upon administration \nwith food, it is recommended that Targretin capsules be administered with food.\n\nOn the basis of the oxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome P450 3A4, grapefruit juice may \ntheoretically lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of bexarotene in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity. Based on the comparison of animal and patient exposures to bexarotene, \na margin of safety for human teratogenicity has not been demonstrated (see section 5.3). Bexarotene is \ncontraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).\n\nIf this medicinal product is used inadvertently during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant \nwhile taking this medicinal product, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the \nfoetus.\n\nContraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential must use adequate birth-control measures when bexarotene is used.\nA negative, sensitive, pregnancy test (e.g. serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, beta-HCG) \nshould be obtained within one week prior to bexarotene therapy. Effective contraception must be used \nfrom the time of the negative pregnancy test through the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at \nleast one month following discontinuation of therapy. Whenever contraception is required, it is \nrecommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously. Bexarotene can \npotentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the efficacy of \noestroprogestative contraceptives (see section 4.5). Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a \nwoman with childbearing potential, a reliable, non-hormonal contraceptive method is also \nrecommended. Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or may \npotentially become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and \nfor at least one month after the last dose. \n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether bexarotene is excreted in human milk. Bexarotene should not be used in \nbreast-feeding mothers.\n\nFertility\nThere are no human data on the effect of bexarotene on fertility. In male dogs, some effects have been \ndocumented (see section 5.3). Effects on fertility cannot be excluded.  \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \ndizziness and visual difficulties have been reported in patients taking Targretin. Patients who \nexperience dizziness or visual difficulties during therapy must not drive or operate machinery.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety of bexarotene has been examined in clinical studies of 193 patients with CTCL who \nreceived bexarotene for up to 118 weeks and in 420 non-CTCL cancer patients in other studies.\n\nIn 109 patients with CTCL treated at the recommended initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day, the most \ncommonly reported adverse reactions to Targretin were hyperlipaemia ((primarily elevated \ntriglycerides) 74%), hypothyroidism (29%), hypercholesterolaemia (28%), headache (27%), \nleucopenia (20%), pruritus (20%), asthenia (19%), rash (16%), exfoliative dermatitis (15%), and pain \n(12%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following Targretin-related adverse reactions were reported during clinical studies in patients with \nCTCL (N=109) treated at the recommended initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day. The frequencies of adverse \nreactions are classified as very common (>1/10), common (>1/100, <1/10), uncommon \n(>1/1,000, <1/100), rare (>1/10,000, <1/1,000), and very rare (<1/10,000).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions reported in patients in clinical trials\nSystem Organ \nClass\n(MedDRA

CTCL at an initial dose >300mg/m2/day or in non-CTCL cancer \nindications):\n\n\n\n9\n\nNewly observed adverse reactions\nEcchymosis, petechia, abnormal white blood cells, thromboplastin  decreased,

observations of the following were also reported: bone marrow depression, decreased \nprothrombin, decreased gonadotrophic luteinizing hormone, increased amylase, hyponatraemia, \nhypokalaemia, hyperuricaemia, hypocholesterolaemia, hypolipaemia, hypomagnesaemia, abnormal \ngait, stupor, circumoral paraesthesia, abnormal thinking, eye pain, hypovolaemia, subdural \nhaematoma, congestive heart

\narthritis, joint disorder, urinary retention, impaired urination, polyuria, nocturia, impotence, urine \nabnormality, breast enlargement, carcinoma, photosensitivity reaction, face oedema, malaise, viral \ninfection, enlarged abdomen.\n\nThe majority of adverse reactions were noted at a higher incidence at doses greater than \n300 mg/m2/day. Generally, these resolved without sequelae on dose reduction or withdrawal of \ntreatment. However, among a total of 810 patients, including those without malignancy, treated with \nbexarotene, there were three serious adverse reactions with fatal outcome (acute pancreatitis, subdural \nhaematoma and liver failure). Of these, liver failure, subsequently determined to be not related to \nbexarotene, was the only one to occur in a CTCL patient.\n\nHypothyroidism generally occurs 4-8 weeks after commencement of therapy. It may be asymptomatic \nand responds to treatment with thyroxine and resolves upon withdrawal of treatment.\n\nBexarotene has a different adverse reaction profile to other oral, non-retinoid X receptor \n(RXR)-selective retinoids. Owing to its primarily RXR-binding activity, bexarotene is less likely to \ncause mucocutaneous, nail, and hair toxicities; arthralgia; and myalgia; which are frequently reported \nwith retinoic acid receptor (RAR) -binding agents.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo clinical experience with an overdose of Targretin has been reported. Any overdose should be \ntreated with supportive care for the signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient.\n\nDoses up to 1000 mg/m2/day of bexarotene have been administered in clinical studies with no acute \ntoxic effects. Single doses of 1500 mg/kg (9000 mg/m2) and 720 mg/kg (14,400 mg/m2) were tolerated \nwithout significant toxicity in rats and dogs, respectively.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX25\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBexarotene is a synthetic compound that exerts its biological action through selective binding and \nactivation of the three RXRs: \uf061, \uf062, and \uf067. Once activated, these receptors function as transcription \nfactors that regulate processes such as cellular differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin \nsensitisation. The ability of the RXRs to form heterodimers with various receptor partners that are \nimportant in cellular function and in physiology indicates that the biological activities of bexarotene \nare more diverse than those of compounds that activate the RARs. \n\nIn vitro, bexarotene inhibits the growth of tumour cell lines of haematopoietic and squamous cell \norigin. In vivo, bexarotene causes tumour regression in some animal models and prevents tumour \ninduction in others.  However, the exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of \ncutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown.\n\nClinical results\n\nBexarotene capsules were evaluated in clinical trials of 193 patients with CTCL of whom 93 had \nadvanced stage disease refractory to prior systemic therapy. Among the 61 patients treated at an initial \ndose of 300 mg/m2/day, the overall response rate, according to a global assessment by the physician, \nwas 51% (31/61) with a clinical complete response rate of 3%. Responses were also determined by a \ncomposite score of five clinical signs (surface area, erythema, plaque elevation, scaling and \nhypo/hyperpigmentation) which also considered all extracutaneous CTCL manifestations. The overall \nresponse rate according to this composite assessment was 31% (19/61) with a clinical complete \nresponse rate of 7% (4/61).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nAbsorption/dose proportionality: pharmacokinetics were linear up to a dose of 650 mg/m2. Terminal \nelimination half-life values were generally between one and three hours. Following repeat once daily \ndose administration at dose levels \uf0b3 230 mg/m2, Cmax and AUC in some patients were less than \nrespective single dose values. No evidence of prolonged accumulation was observed. At the \nrecommended initial daily-dose level (300 mg/m2), single-dose and repeated daily-dose bexarotene \npharmacokinetic parameters were similar. \n\nDistribution\n\nProtein binding/distribution: bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The uptake of \nbexarotene by organs or tissues has not been evaluated.\n\nBiotransformation  \n\nMetabolism: bexarotene metabolites in plasma include 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and \n7-oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest glucuronidation as a metabolic pathway, and that \ncytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 isozyme responsible for formation of the \noxidative metabolites. Based on the in vitro binding and the retinoid receptor activation profile of the \nmetabolites, and on the relative amounts of individual metabolites in plasma, the metabolites have \nlittle impact on the pharmacological profile of retinoid receptor activation by bexarotene.\n\n\n\n11\n\nElimination\n\nExcretion: neither bexarotene nor its metabolites are excreted in urine in any appreciable amounts. \nThe estimated renal clearance of bexarotene is less than 1 ml/minute. Renal excretion is not a \nsignificant elimination pathway for bexarotene.\n\nPharmacokinetics in Special Populations\nAge: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged \u2265 65 years and \n343 patients aged < 65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene \npharmacokinetics.\n\nBody Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients \nwith a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body \nweight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics.\n\nRace: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black \npatients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians.  There are insufficient \ndata to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nBexarotene is not genotoxic. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. Fertility studies have \nnot been conducted; however, in sexually immature male dogs, reversible aspermatogenesis (28-day \nstudy) and testicular degeneration (91-day study) were seen. When bexarotene was administered for \nsix months to sexually mature dogs, no testicular effects were seen. Effects on fertility cannot be \nexcluded. Bexarotene, in common with the majority of retinoids, was teratogenic and embryotoxic in \nan animal test species at systemic exposures that are achievable clinically in humans.

What you need to know before you take Targretin\n3. How to take Targretin\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Targretin\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Targretin is and what it is used for\n\nThe active substance in Targretin, bexarotene, belongs to a group of medicines known as retinoids, \nwhich are related to vitamin A. \n\nTargretin capsules are used by patients with advanced stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) \nwhose disease has not responded to other therapies. CTCL is a condition in which certain cells of the \nbody\u2019s lymph system called T-lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Targretin\n\nDo not take Targretin:\n\n- if you are allergic to bexarotene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).\n\n- if you are pregnant or breast feeding or if you can become pregnant and are not using effective \nbirth control measures.\n\n- if you have a history of pancreatitis, have uncontrolled lipid (blood fats) elevations (high blood \ncholesterol or high blood triglycerides), have a condition known as hypervitaminosis A, have \nuncontrolled thyroid disease, have insufficient liver function or have an ongoing systemic \ninfection.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking Targretin\n- if you have a known hypersensitivity to retinoids (related to vitamin A), suffer from liver \n\ndisease, have high blood lipids or take medicines which may cause high blood lipids, have \nuncontrolled diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), have had gall bladder or biliary tract disease, or \nconsume excessive amounts of alcohol.\n\n- if you have ever had any mental health problems including depression, aggressive tendencies or \nmood changes. This is because taking Targretin may affect your mood.\n\nYour fasting blood lipid determinations may have to be performed before therapy is initiated and at \nweekly intervals afterwards, and then monthly while taking this medicine.\n\n\n\n21\n\nBlood tests to evaluate the function of your liver and thyroid gland and to monitor your red blood cell \nand white blood cell counts will be obtained before therapy is started and will be monitored during \ntherapy.\n\nPeriodic eye exams may be needed if you experience visual difficulties while taking this medicine.\n\nMinimise exposure to sunlight as much as possible and avoid exposure to sun lamps. \n\nDo not take more than 15,000 International Units of vitamin A supplements per day during treatment.\n\nMental health problems\nYou may not notice some changes in your mood and behaviour and so it is very important that you tell \nyour friends and family that this medicine could affect your mood and behaviour. They may notice \nthese changes and help you identify any problems that you need to talk to your doctor about.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nTargretin capsules should not be used in children or adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Targretin\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, such as\n\uf0b7 ketoconazole and itraconazole (used against fungal infections),\n\uf0b7 erythromycin, clarithromycin and rifampicin (used against bacterial infections),\n\uf0b7 phenytoin and phenobarbital (used against seizures),\n\uf0b7 gemfibrozil (used to reduce high levels of fats in the blood such as triglycerides and \n\ncholesterol),\n\uf0b7 vitamin A supplements, protease inhibitors (used against viral infections),\n\uf0b7 tamoxifen (used against some forms of cancer),\n\uf0b7 dexamethasone (used for inflammatory conditions),\n\uf0b7 insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion, or insulin-sensitisers (used against diabetes \n\nmellitus).\n\nThis is important as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the \neffect of the medicines.\n\nTargretin with food and drink\nTargretin should be taken with food (see section 3). If you regularly consume grapefruit or grapefruit \njuice, please consult your doctor as these have the potential to alter your body\u2019s response to Targretin \ntherapy.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTargretin may be harmful to a developing foetus.  DO NOT use Targretin if you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to \nhave a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nIf you are capable of becoming pregnant, you must have a pregnancy test within one week before you \nstart therapy, confirming you are not pregnant. You must use effective contraception (birth control) \ncontinuously starting one month before beginning therapy until one month after you stop taking \nTargretin. It is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used together. If you are \ntaking a hormonal contraceptive (for example, birth control pills), you should discuss this with your \ndoctor.\n\nIf you are male and your partner is pregnant or capable of becoming pregnant, you must use condoms \nduring sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose.\n\n\n\n22\n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is not known whether Targretin has an effect on your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. If \nyou experience dizziness or problems with your vision during therapy, do not drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\nTargretin contains sorbitol and butylated hydroxyanisole\nTargretin contains a small amount of sorbitol (a type of sugar).
