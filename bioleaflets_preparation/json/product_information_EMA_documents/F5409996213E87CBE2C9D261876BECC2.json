This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nExviera 250 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 250 mg of dasabuvir (as sodium monohydrate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 45 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nBeige, ovaloid, film-coated tablets with dimensions of 14.0 mm x 8.0 mm and debossed on one side \nwith ‘AV2’. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nExviera is indicated in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (CHC) in adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nFor hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype specific activity, see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with dasabuvir should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of chronic hepatitis C. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 250 mg of dasabuvir (one tablet) twice daily (morning and evening). \n \n Dasabuvir must not be administered as monotherapy. Dasabuvir should be used in combination with \nother medicinal products for the treatment of HCV (see section 5.1). Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of the medicinal products that are used in combination with dasabuvir. \n \nThe recommended co-administered medicinal product(s) and treatment duration for dasabuvir \ncombination therapy are provided in Table 1.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nTable 1. Recommended co-administered medicinal product(s) and treatment duration for \ndasabuvir by patient population \n \n\nPatient population Treatment* Duration \n\nGenotype 1b, without cirrhosis or \nwith compensated cirrhosis \n\ndasabuvir + \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir  \n\n12 weeks  \n \n\n8 weeks may be considered in \npreviously untreated genotype 1b-\ninfected patients with minimal to \n\nmoderate fibrosis** (see section 5.1, \nGARNET study) \n\nGenotype 1a, \nwithout cirrhosis \n\ndasabuvir + \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + \n\nribavirin* \n12 weeks \n\nGenotype 1a, \nwith compensated cirrhosis \n\ndasabuvir + \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + \n\nribavirin* \n24 weeks (see section 5.1.) \n\n*Note: Follow the genotype 1a dosing recommendations in patients with an unknown genotype 1 subtype or \nwith mixed genotype 1 infection. \n** When assessing severity of liver disease using non-invasive methods, a combination of blood biomarkers or \nthe combination of liver stiffness measurement and a blood test improves accuracy and should be undertaken \nprior to 8 week treatment in all patients with moderate fibrosis. \n \nMissed doses \nIn case a dose of dasabuvir is missed, the prescribed dose can be taken within 6 hours. If more than 6 \nhours have passed since dasabuvir is usually taken, the missed dose should NOT be taken and the \npatient should take the next dose per the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed not to \ntake a double dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHIV-1 Co-infection \nThe dosing recommendations in Table 1 should be followed. For dosing recommendations with HIV \nantiviral medicinal products, refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5. See sections 4.8 and 5.1 for additional \ninformation. \n \nLiver transplant recipients \nDasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in combination with ribavirin is recommended for \n24 weeks in liver transplant recipients. Lower ribavirin dose at initiation may be appropriate. In the \npost-liver transplant study, ribavirin dosing was individualized and most subjects received 600 to \n800 mg per day (see section 5.1). For dosing recommendations with calcineurin inhibitors refer to \nsection 4.5.  \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment of dasabuvir is warranted in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment of dasabuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal \nimpairment or end-stage-renal disease on dialysis (see section 5.2). For patients that require ribavirin, \nrefer to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics for information regarding use in patients \nwith renal impairment. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment of dasabuvir is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). \nDasabuvir should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B \nor C) (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of dasabuvir in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe film-coated tablets are for oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole (i.e. \npatients should not chew, break or dissolve the tablet). To maximise absorption, dasabuvir tablets \nshould be taken with food, without regard to fat and calorie content (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see section 5.2). \n \nUse of ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products such as those contained in most combined oral \ncontraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers \nis expected to decrease dasabuvir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect (see section \n4.5. Examples of contraindicated inducers are provided below. \n \nEnzyme inducers: \n \n\n• carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital \n• efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine \n• apalutamide, enzalutamide \n• mitotane \n• rifampicin \n• St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\n \nMedicinal products that are strong CYP2C8 inhibitors may increase dasabuvir plasma concentrations \nand must not be co-administered with dasabuvir (see section 4.5). Examples of contraindicated \nCYP2C8 inhibitors are provided below.  \n \nCYP2C8 inhibitor: \n \n\n• gemfibrozil \n \nDasabuvir is administered with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir. For contra-indications with \nombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nDasabuvir is not recommended for administration as monotherapy and must be used in combination \nwith other medicinal products for the treatment of hepatitis C infection (see section 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nRisk of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure in patients with cirrhosis \n \nHepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or fatal outcomes, have \nbeen reported post-marketing in patients treated with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nwith and without ribavirin. Most patients with these severe outcomes had evidence of advanced or \ndecompensated cirrhosis prior to initiating therapy. Although causality is difficult to establish due to \nbackground advanced liver disease, a potential risk cannot be excluded.  \n \nDasabuvir should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B \nor C) (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nFor patients with cirrhosis: \n\n• Monitoring should be performed for clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation \n(such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage). \n\n• Hepatic laboratory testing including direct bilirubin levels should be performed at baseline, \nduring the first 4 weeks of starting treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter. \n\n• Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop evidence of hepatic \ndecompensation. \n\n \nALT elevations \n \nDuring clinical trials with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin, \ntransient elevations of ALT to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in \napproximately 1% of subjects (35 of 3,039). ALT elevations were asymptomatic and generally \noccurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, without concomitant elevations of bilirubin, and \ndeclined within approximately two weeks of onset with continued dosing of dasabuvir and \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin.  \n \nThese ALT elevations were significantly more frequent in the subgroup of subjects who were using \nethinyloestradiol -containing medicinal products such as combined oral contraceptives or \ncontraceptive vaginal rings (6 of 25 subjects); (see section 4.3). In contrast, the rate of ALT elevations \nin subjects using other types of oestrogens as typically used in hormonal replacement therapy (i.e., oral \nand topical oestradiol and conjugated oestrogens) was similar to the rate observed in subjects who \nwere not using oestrogen-containing products (approximately 1% in each group).  \n \nPatients who are taking ethinyloestradiol -containing medicinal products (i.e. most combined oral \ncontraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings) must switch to an alternative method of contraception \n(e.g., progestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) prior to initiating dasabuvir with \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir therapy (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nAlthough ALT elevations associated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir have been \nasymptomatic, patients should be instructed to watch for early warning signs of liver inflammation, \nsuch as fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, as well as later signs such as \njaundice and discoloured faeces, and to consult a doctor without delay if such symptoms occur. \nRoutine monitoring of liver enzymes is not necessary in patients that do not have cirrhosis (for \ncirrhotics, see above). Early discontinuation may result in drug resistance, but implications for future \ntherapy are not known. \n \nPregnancy and concomitant use with ribavirin \n \nAlso see section 4.6.  \n \nExtreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male \npatients when dasabuvir is taken in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.6 and refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nUse with tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus  \n \nCo-administration of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with systemic tacrolimus, \nsirolimus or everolimus increases the concentrations of the immunosuppressant due to CYP3A \ninhibition by ritonavir (see section 4.5). Serious and/or life threatening events have been observed with \nco-administration of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with systemic tacrolimus, and a \nsimilar risk can be expected with sirolimus and everolimus.  \n  \nAvoid concomitant use of tacrolimus or sirolimus with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nunless the benefits outweigh the risks. If tacrolimus or sirolimus are used together with dasabuvir and \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, caution is advised, and recommended doses and monitoring \nstrategies can be found in section 4.5. Everolimus cannot be used due to lack of suitable dose strengths \nfor dose adjustments.  \n \nTacrolimus or sirolimus whole blood concentrations should be monitored upon initiation and \nthroughout co-administration with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and the dose and/or \ndosing frequency should be adjusted as needed.  Patients should be monitored frequently for any \nchanges in renal function or tacrolimus or sirolimus associated adverse reactions. Refer to the \ntacrolimus or sirolimus Summary of Product Characteristics for additional dosing and monitoring \ninstructions. \n \nDepression or psychiatric illness \n \nCases of depression and more rarely of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt have been reported with \ndasabuvir with or without ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir treatment in combination with ribavirin in \nthe majority of the cases. Although some cases had previous history of depression, psychiatric illness \nand/or substance abuse, a causal relation with dasabuvir with or without \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir treatment cannot be excluded. Caution should be used in patients with \na pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Patients and caregivers should be instructed \nto notify the prescriber of any changes in behaviour or mood and of any suicidal ideation. \n \nGenotype-specific activity \n \nConcerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning \ngenotype-specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1. \n \nThe efficacy of dasabuvir has not been established in patients with HCV genotypes other than \ngenotype 1; dasabuvir should not be used for the treatment of patients infected with other genotypes \nthan 1. \n \nCo-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV \n \nDasabuvir safety and efficacy have been established in combination with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir \n/ritonavir with or without ribavirin. Co-administration of dasabuvir with other antivirals has not been \nstudied and, therefore, cannot be recommended. \n \nRetreatment \n \nThe efficacy of dasabuvir in patients previously exposed to dasabuvir, or to medicinal products \nanticipated to be cross-resistant, has not been demonstrated. \n \nUse with statins  \n \nRosuvastatin \nDasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is expected to increase the exposure to rosuvastatin \nmore than 3-fold. If rosuvastatin treatment is required during the treatment period, the maximum daily \ndose of rosuvastatin should be 5 mg (see section 4.5, Table 2).  \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \nPitavastatin and fluvastatin \nThe interactions with pitavastatin and fluvastatin have not been investigated. Theoretically, dasabuvir \nwith ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is expected to increase the exposure to pitavastatin and \nfluvastatin. A temporary suspension of pitavastatin/fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of \ntreatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. If statin treatment is required during the treatment \nperiod, a switch to a reduced dose of pravastatin/rosuvastatin is possible (see section 4.5, Table 2). \n \nTreatment of patients with HIV co-infection \n \nDasabuvir is recommended in combination with paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir, and ritonavir may \nselect for PI resistance in HIV co-infected patients without ongoing antiretroviral therapy. HIV co-\ninfected patients without suppressive antiretroviral therapy should not be treated with dasabuvir. \nDrug interactions need to be carefully taken into account in the setting of HIV co-infection (for details \nsee section 4.5, Table 2). \n \nAtazanavir can be used in combination with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir if \nadministered at the same time. To be noted, atazanavir should be taken without ritonavir, since \nritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose \ncombination. The combination carries an increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia (including ocular \nicterus), in particular when ribavirin is part of the hepatitis C regimen. \n \nDarunavir, dosed 800 mg once daily, if administered at the same time as \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, can be used in the absence of extensive PI resistance (darunavir \nexposure lowered). To be noted, darunavir should be taken without ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg \nonce daily is provided as part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose combination. \n \nFor the use of HIV protease inhibitors other than atazanavir and darunavir refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics of ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir. \n \nRaltegravir exposure is substantially increased (2-fold). The combination was not linked to any \nparticular safety issues in a limited set of patients treated for 12-24 weeks. \n \nRilpivirine exposure is substantially increased (3-fold) when rilpivirine is given in combination with \ndasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with a consequent potential for QT-prolongation. If \nan HIV protease inhibitor is added (atazanavir, darunavir), rilpivirine exposure may increase even \nfurther and is, therefore, not recommended. Rilpivirine should be used cautiously, in the setting of \nrepeated ECG monitoring. \n \nNNRTIs other than rilpivirine (efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine) are contraindicated (see section \n4.3). \n \nHepatitis B virus reactivation \n \nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should, \ntherefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. \n \nUse in diabetic patients  \n \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic \npatients initiating direct acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the \nfirst 3 months, and their diabetic medicinal products modified when necessary. The physician in \ncharge of the diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct acting antiviral therapy is \ninitiated.  \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \n. \n \nLactose \n \nExviera contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDasabuvir must always be administered together with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir . When co-\nadministered they exert mutual effects on each other (see section 5.2). Therefore, the interaction \nprofile of the compounds must be considered as a combination. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nCoadministration with enzyme inducers may lead to an increased risk of adverse reactions and ALT \nelevations (see Table 2). \nCoadministration with ethinyloestradiol may lead to increased risk of ALT elevations (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). Contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nPotential for dasabuvir to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \nIn vivo drug interaction studies evaluated the net effect of the combination treatment, including \nritonavir. The following section describes the specific transporters and metabolizing enzymes that are \naffected by dasabuvir when combined with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. See Table 2 for guidance \nregarding potential drug interactions and dosing recommendations for dasabuvir administered with \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4 \nRefer to the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir Summary of Product Characteristics for details. (see also \nTable 2).  \n \nMedicinal products transported by the OATP family  \nRefer to the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir Summary of Product Characteristics for details on \nOATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 substrates (see also Table 2). \n \nMedicinal products transported by BCRP \nDasabuvir is an inhibitor of BCRP in vivo. Co-administration of dasabuvir with \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir together with medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP may \nincrease plasma concentrations of these transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose \nadjustment/clinical monitoring. Such medicinal products include sulfasalazine, imatinib and some of \nthe statins (see Table 2). See also Table 2 for specific advice on rosuvastatin which has been evaluated \nin a drug interaction study. \n \nMedicinal products transported by Pgp in the intestine \nWhile dasabuvir is an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp, no significant change was observed in the exposure of \nthe P-gp substrate, digoxin, when administered with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. \nIt may not be excluded that the systemic exposure of dabigatran etexilate is increased by dasabuvir due \nto inhibition of P-gp in the intestine. \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by glucuronidation \nDasabuvir is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 in vivo. Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products \nthat are primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 result in increased plasma concentrations of such \nmedicinal products; routine clinical monitoring is recommended for narrow therapeutic index \nmedicinal products (i.e. levothyroxine). See also Table 2 for specific advice on raltegravir and \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nbuprenorphine which have been evaluated in drug interaction studies. Dasabuvir has also been found \nto inhibit UGT1A4, 1A6 and intestinal UGT2B7 in vitro at in vivo relevant concentrations. \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 \nCo-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir can decrease exposures of \nmedicinal products that are metabolized by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole, esomeprazole, s-\n mephenytoin), which may require dose adjustment/clinical monitoring. CYP2C19 substrates \nevaluated in drug interaction studies include omeprazole and escitalopram (Table 2).  \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 \nDasabuvir administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir did not affect the exposures of the \nCYP2C9 substrate warfarin. Other CYP2C9 substrates (NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), antidiabetics (e.g. \nglimepiride, glipizide) are not expected to require dose adjustments.  \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 \nDasabuvir administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir did not affect the exposures of the \nCYP2D6 /CYP1A2 substrate duloxetine. Exposures of cyclobenzaprine, a CYP1A2 substrate, were \ndecreased. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may be needed for other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. \nciprofloxacin, cyclobenzaprine, theophylline and caffeine). CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine, \nmetoprolol and dextromethorphan) are not expected to require dose adjustments.  \n \nMedicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins \nDasabuvir does not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo as shown by the lack of \ninteraction with tenofovir (OAT1 substrate). In vitro studies show that dasabuvir is not an inhibitor of \norganic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion transporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin \nextrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n \nTherefore, dasabuvir is not expected to affect medicinal products which are primarily excreted by the \nrenal route via these transporters (see section 5.2).  \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of dasabuvir \n \nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP2C8 \nCo-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that inhibit CYP2C8 (e.g. teriflunomide, \ndeferasirox) may increase dasabuvir plasma concentrations. Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors are \ncontraindicated with dasabuvir (see section 4.3 and Table 2). \n\n \nEnzyme inducers  \nCo-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that are moderate or strong enzyme inducers \nis expected to decrease dasabuvir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. \nContraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3 and Table 2.  \n \nDasabuvir is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP and its major metabolite M1 is a substrate of OCT1 in \nvitro. Inhibition of P-gp and BCRP is not expected to show clinically relevant increases in exposures \nof dasabuvir (Table 2). \n \nDasabuvir M1 metabolite was quantified in all the drug interaction studies. Changes in exposures of \nthe metabolite were generally consistent with that observed with dasabuvir except for studies with \nCYP2C8 inhibitor, gemfibrozil, where the metabolite exposures decreased by up to 95% and CYP3A \ninducer, carbamazepine, where the metabolite exposures decreased by only up to 39%. \n \nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \n \nAs liver function may change during treatment with dasabuvir administered with \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, a close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is \nrecommended. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nDrug interaction studies \n \nRecommendations for co-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for a \nnumber of medicinal products are provided in Table 2. \n \nIf a patient is already taking medicinal product(s) or initiating a medicinal product while receiving \ndasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for which potential for drug interaction is expected, \ndose adjustment of the concomitant medicinal product(s) or appropriate clinical monitoring should be \nconsidered (Table 2). \n \nIf dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products are made due to treatment with dasabuvir and \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, doses should be re-adjusted after administration of dasabuvir and \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is completed. \n \nTable 2 provides the Least Squares Means Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of \ndasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and concomitant medicinal products.  \nThe direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the change in exposures (Cmax, and AUC) in the \nparitaprevir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir and the co-administered medicinal product (↑= increase more than \n20%, ↓ = decrease more than 20%, ↔ = no change or change less than 20%).  \n \nThis is not an exclusive list. Dasabuvir is administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. For \ninteractions with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \nTable 2.

Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have \nbeen demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin; therefore, ribavirin is contraindicated in \nwomen who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Refer to the Summary \nof Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information. \n \nFemale patients: Women of childbearing potential should not receive ribavirin unless they are using \nan effective form of contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 4 months after treatment.  \n \nMale patients and their female partners: Either male patients or their female partners of childbearing \npotential must use a form of effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 7 months \nafter treatment.  \n \nEthinyloestradiol is contraindicated in combination with dasabuvir (see section 4.3). See additional \ninformation on specific hormonal contraceptives in sections 4.3 and 4.4. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are very limited data from the use of dasabuvir in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a \nprecautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of dasabuvir during pregnancy. \n \nIf ribavirin is co-administered with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, the \ncontraindications regarding use of ribavirin during pregnancy apply (see also the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of ribavirin).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether dasabuvir and metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of dasabuvir and metabolites in milk (see \nsection 5.3). Because of the potential for adverse reactions from the medicinal product in breastfed \ninfants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue treatment with \ndasabuvir, taking into account the importance of the therapy to the mother. Patients receiving ribavirin \nshould also refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of dasabuvir on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDasabuvir has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Patients should be \ninformed that fatigue has been reported during treatment with dasabuvir in combination with \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \n \nIn subjects receiving dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin, the most \ncommonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 20% of subjects) were fatigue and nausea. The \nproportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.2% \n(5/2,044) and 4.8% (99/2,044) of subjects had ribavirin dose reductions due to adverse reactions. \n \n \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety summary is based on pooled data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in subjects who received \ndasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin.  The majority of adverse \nreactions presented in Table 3 were of grade 1 severity in dasabuvir- and \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir-containing regimens. \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined \nas follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000).  \n \nTable 3.

As the incidence of such elevations was 26% among women \ntaking a concomitant ethinyloestradiol-containing medicine, such medicinal products are \ncontraindicated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. No increase in incidence of ALT \nelevations was observed with other types of systemic oestrogens commonly used for hormone \nreplacement therapy (e.g., oestradiol and conjugated oestrogens). ALT elevations were typically \nasymptomatic, generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment (mean time 20 days, range 8-\n57 days) and most resolved with ongoing therapy. Two patients discontinued dasabuvir and \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to elevated ALT, including one on ethinyloestradiol. Three \ninterrupted dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for one to seven days, including one on \nethinyloestradiol. The majority of these ALT elevations were transient and assessed as related to \ndasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Elevations in ALT were generally not associated with \nbilirubin elevations. Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT (see section 4.4). \n \nSerum bilirubin elevations  \n \nTransient elevations in serum bilirubin (predominantly indirect) were observed in subjects receiving \ndasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin, related to the inhibition of the bilirubin \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\ntransporters OATP1B1/1B3 by paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced haemolysis. Bilirubin elevations \noccurred after initiation of treatment, peaked by study Week 1, and generally resolved with ongoing \ntherapy. Bilirubin elevations were not associated with aminotransferase elevations. The frequency of \nindirect bilirubin elevations was lower among subjects who did not receive ribavirin. \n \nLiver transplant recipients \n \nThe overall safety profile in HCV-infected transplant recipients who were administered dasabuvir and \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin (in addition to their immunosuppressant medicinal \nproducts) was similar to subjects treated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and \nribavirin in phase 3 clinical trials, although some adverse reactions were increased in frequency. 10 \nsubjects (29.4%) had at least one post baseline haemoglobin value of less than 10 g/dL. 10 of 34 \nsubjects (29.4%) dose modified ribavirin due to decrease in haemoglobin and 2.9% (1/34) had an \ninterruption of ribavirin. Ribavirin dose modification did not impact SVR rates. 5 subjects required \nerythropoietin, all of whom initiated ribavirin at the starting dose of 1000 to 1200 mg daily. No subject \nreceived a blood transfusion. \n \nHIV/HCV co-infected patients \n \nThe overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV \nmono-infected subjects. Transient elevations in total bilirubin >3 x ULN (mostly indirect) occurred in \n17 (27.0%) subjects; 15 of these subjects were receiving atazanavir. None of the subjects with \nhyperbilirubinemia had concomitant elevations of aminotransferases. \n \nGT1-infected subjects with or without cirrhosis with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) \nDasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin were assessed in 68 subjects \nwith genotype 1 infection with or without cirrhosis who have severe renal impairment or ESRD (see \nSection 5.1). The overall safety profile in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that \nseen in prior Phase 3 studies in subjects without severe renal impairment, except that a greater \nproportion of subjects required intervention due to ribavirin-associated decreases in serum \nhaemoglobin. The mean baseline haemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in \nhaemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking RBV was 1.2 g/dL.  Thirty-nine of the 50 \nsubjects who received ribavirin required interruption of ribavirin, and 11 of these subjects were also \ntreated with erythropoietin. Four subjects experienced a haemoglobin level < 8 g/dL.  Two subjects \nreceived a blood transfusion.  Adverse events of anaemia were not seen in the 18 GT1b-infected \nsubjects who did not receive ribavirin. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir was \nalso evaluated without ribavirin in 18 GT1a- and GT4-infected patients; no adverse events of anaemia \nwere seen in these subjects. \n \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of dasabuvir in children and adolescents aged < 18 years has not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest documented single dose of dasabuvir administered to healthy volunteers was 2 g. No \nstudy drug-related adverse reactions or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were observed. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n31 \n \n\nIn case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of \nadverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; direct-acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AP09 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDasabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the \nNS5B gene, which is essential for replication of the viral genome.  \n \nCo-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir combines three direct-acting \nantiviral medicinal products with distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance \nprofiles to target HCV at multiple steps in the viral lifecycle. Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for its pharmacological properties. \n \nActivity in cell culture and biochemical studies \n \nThe EC50 of dasabuvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture \nassays was 7.7 and 1.8 nM, respectively. The replicon activity of dasabuvir was attenuated 12- to 13-\nfold in the presence of 40% human plasma. The mean EC50 of dasabuvir against replicons containing \nNS5B from a panel of treatment-naïve genotype 1a and 1b isolates in the HCV replicon cell culture \nassay was 0.77 nM (range 0.4 to 2.1 nM; n=11) and 0.46 nM (range 0.2 to 2 nM; n=10), respectively. \nIn biochemical assays, dasabuvir inhibited a panel of genotype 1a and 1b polymerases with a mean \nIC50 value of 4.2 nM (range 2.2 to 10.7 nM; n=7). \n \nThe M1 metabolite of dasabuvir had EC50 values of 39 and 8 nM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-\nCon1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays, respectively, and the activity of the M1 metabolite \nwas attenuated 3- to 4-fold in the presence of 40% human plasma. Dasabuvir had reduced activity in \nbiochemical assays against NS5B polymerases from HCV genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a and 4a (IC50 values \nranging from 900 nM to >20 μM). \n \nResistance \n \nIn cell culture \nResistance to dasabuvir conferred by variants in NS5B selected in cell culture or identified in Phase 2b \nand 3 clinical trials were phenotypically characterised in the appropriate genotype 1a or 1b replicons. \n \nIn genotype 1a, substitutions C316Y, M414T, Y448H, A553T, G554S, S556G/R, and Y561H in HCV \nNS5B reduced susceptibility to dasabuvir. In the genotype 1a replicon, the activity of dasabuvir was \nreduced 21- to 32-fold by the M414T, S556G or Y561H substitutions; 152- to 261-fold by the A553T, \nG554S or S556R substitutions; and 1472- and 975-fold by the C316Y and Y448H substitutions, \nrespectively. G558R and D559G/N were observed as treatment-emergent substitutions but the activity \nof dasabuvir against these variants could not be evaluated due to poor replication capacity. In genotype \n1b, substitutions C316N, C316Y, M414T, Y448H, and S556G in HCV NS5B reduced susceptibility to \ndasabuvir. The activity of dasabuvir was reduced by 5- and 11-fold by C316N and S556G, \nrespectively; 46-fold by M414T or Y448H; and 1569-fold by the C316Y substitutions in the genotype \n1b replicon. Dasabuvir retained full activity against replicons containing substitutions S282T in the \nnucleoside binding site, M423T in the lower thumb site, and P495A/S, P496S or V499A in the upper \nthumb site.  \n \nEffect of baseline HCV substitutions/polymorphisms on treatment response \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nA pooled analysis of subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection, who were treated with dasabuvir, \nombitasvir and paritaprevir with or without ribavirin in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials, was conducted to \nexplore the association between baseline NS3/4A, NS5A or NS5B substitutions/polymorphisms and \ntreatment outcome in these recommended regimens.  \n \nIn the greater than 500 genotype 1a baseline samples in this analysis, the most frequently observed \nresistance-associated variants were M28V (7.4%) in NS5A and S556G (2.9%) in NS5B. Q80K, \nalthough a highly prevalent polymorphism in NS3 (41.2% of samples), confers minimal resistance to \nparitaprevir. Resistance-associated variants at amino acid positions R155 and D168 in NS3 were rarely \nobserved (less than 1%) at baseline. In the greater than 200 genotype 1b baseline samples in this \nanalysis, the most frequently observed resistance-associated variants observed were Y93H (7.5%) in \nNS5A, and C316N (17.0%) and S556G (15%) in NS5B. Given the low virologic failure rates observed \nwith recommended treatment regimens for HCV genotype 1a- and 1b-infected subjects, the presence \nof baseline variants appears to have little impact on the likelihood of achieving SVR. \n \nIn clinical studies \nOf the 2,510 HCV genotype 1 infected subjects who were treated with regimens containing dasabuvir, \nombitasvir and paritaprevir with or without ribavirin (for 8, 12 or 24 weeks) in Phase 2b and 3 clinical \ntrials, a total of 74 subjects (3%) experienced virologic failure (primarily post-treatment relapse). \nTreatment-emergent variants and their prevalence in these virologic failure populations are shown in \nTable 5. In the 67 genotype 1a infected subjects, NS3 variants were observed in 50 subjects, NS5A \nvariants were observed in 46 subjects, NS5B variants were observed in 37 subjects, and treatment-\nemergent variants were seen in all 3 drug targets in 30 subjects. In the 7 genotype 1b infected subjects, \ntreatment-emergent variants were observed in NS3 in 4 subjects, in NS5A in 2 subjects, and in both \nNS3 and NS5A in 1 subject. No genotype 1b infected subjects had treatment-emergent variants in all 3 \ndrug targets. \n \nTable 5.

Dasabuvir treatment-emergent variants M414T, G554S, S556G, G558R or D559G/N \nin NS5B were observed in 34 subjects. Ombitasvir treatment-emergent variants M28T, M28V or \nQ30R in NS5A were observed in 32 subjects. Paritaprevir treatment-emergent variants V36A/M, \nR155K or D168V were observed in NS3 in 47 subjects. \n \nNS3 variants V36A/M and R155K and NS5B variants M414T and S556G remained detectable at post-\ntreatment Week 48, whereas NS3 variant D168V and all other NS5B variants were not observed at \npost-treatment Week 48. All treatment-emergent variants in NS5A remained detectable at post-\ntreatment Week 48. Due to high SVR rates in genotype 1b, trends in persistence of treatment-emergent \nvariants in this genotype could not be established. \n \nThe lack of detection of virus containing a resistance-associated substitution does not indicate that the \nresistant virus is no longer present at clinically significant levels. The long-term clinical impact of the \nemergence or persistence of virus containing dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir -\nresistance-associated substitutions on future treatment is unknown. \n \nCross-resistance \n \nCross-resistance is expected among NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, and non-nucleoside \nNS5B inhibitors by class. The impact of prior dasabuvir, ombitasvir, or paritaprevir treatment \nexperience on the efficacy of other NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, or NS5B inhibitors \nhas not been studied. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of dasabuvir in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with and \nwithout ribavirin was evaluated in eight Phase 3 clinical trials, including two trials exclusively in \nsubjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), in over 2,360 subjects with genotype 1 chronic \nhepatitis C infection as summarised in Table 6. \n \nTable 6.

In \nPart 1a, SVR12 was achieved by 29/31 (93.5%) subjects on the 12-week arm (95% CI: 79.3% – \n98.2%) and by 29/32 (90.6%) subjects on the 24-week arm (95% CI: 75.8% – 96.8%). There was 1 \nrelapse in the 12-week arm and 1 on-treatment virologic failure in the 24-week arm. In Part 1b, \nSVR12 was achieved by 22/22 (100%) subjects (95% CI: 85.1%, 100%). In Part 2, SVR12 was \nachieved by 27/28 (96.4%) subjects with HCV GT4/HIV-1 coinfection (95% CI: 82.3%, 99.4%) with \nno virologic failures. \n \nThe SVR12 rates in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects were thus consistent with SVR12 rates in the \nphase 3 trials of HCV mono-infected subjects.  \nCORAL-I: treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced, GT 1 or GT4 infected, at least 3 months \npost liver transplant or 12 months post renal transplant  \n \nDesign:  randomised, global multicentre, open-label \nTreatment:  dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for 12 or 24 weeks with or without \nribavirin (investigator chosen dose) for GT1 and GT4 infection \n \nIn subjects with liver transplant, no cirrhosis and GT1 infection, patients were dosed with dasabuvir \nand ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for 12-24 weeks, with and without RBV.

Treated subjects had a median age of \n51 years (range: 26 to 64); 65.8% were male and 5.3% were Black. A majority (86.8%) had baseline \nHCV RNA levels of at least 800,000 IU/mL and a majority (84.2%) had genotype 1a infection; 15.8% \nhad portal fibrosis (F2) and 5.3% had bridging fibrosis (F3); and 94.7% were naïve to prior HCV \ntreatment. \n \nOverall, 37 (97.4%) of 38 subjects achieved SVR12.

Treated subjects (N=68) had \na median age of 58 years (range: 32-77 years); 83.8% were male; 58.8% were Black; 73.5% of \nsubjects were infected with HCV GT1a; 75.0%% had Stage 5 CKD and 69.1% were on haemodialysis.  \n \nSixty four of 68 (94.1%) subjects achieved SVR12. One subject experienced relapse at Post-Treatment \nWeek 4, 2 subjects prematurely discontinued study drug and 1 subject had missing SVR12 data. \n \nSee also Section 4.8 for discussion of safety information for RUBY-I. \n \nIn another open-label phase 3b study evaluating 12 weeks of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or \nwithout dasabuvir and without RBV in non-cirrhotic, treatment-naive GT1a and GT4 patients with \nCKD stage 4 or 5 (Ruby II), the SVR12 rate was 94.4% (17/18), with no subjects experiencing on-\ntreatment virologic failure or relapse. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ndasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in one or more subsets of the paediatric populations in \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of the combination of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nhave been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. Table 18 shows \nmean Cmax and AUC of dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \n25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily following multiple doses with food in healthy volunteers. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nTable 18. Geometric mean Cmax, AUC of multiple doses of dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily and \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily with food in healthy \nvolunteers \n \n\n Cmax (ng/ml) (CV%) AUC (ng*hr/ml) (CV%) \nDasabuvir 1030 (31) 6840 (32) \n\n \nAbsorption \n \nDasabuvir was absorbed after oral administration with mean Tmax of approximately 4 to 5 hours. \nDasabuvir exposures increased in a dose proportional manner and accumulation is minimal. \nPharmacokinetic steady state for dasabuvir when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nis achieved after approximately 12 days of dosing. \n \nEffects of food \n \nDasabuvir should be administered with food. All clinical trials with dasabuvir have been conducted \nfollowing administration with food. \n \nFood increased the exposure (AUC) of dasabuvir by up to 30% relative to the fasting state. The \nincrease in exposure was similar regardless of meal type (e.g., high-fat versus moderate-fat) or calorie \ncontent (approximately 600 kcal versus approximately 1000 kcal). To maximise absorption, dasabuvir \nshould be taken with food without regard to fat or calorie content. \n \nDistribution \n \nDasabuvir is highly bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in \npatients with renal or hepatic impairment. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human ranged \nfrom 0.5 to 0.7 indicating that dasabuvir was preferentially distributed in the plasma compartment of \nwhole blood. Dasabuvir was greater than 99.5%, and M1 major metabolite of dasabuvir was 94.5% \nbound to human plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.05 to 5 µg/mL. At steady-state the \nexposures ratio of M1 to dasabuvir is approximately 0.6. Taking into account the protein binding and \nin vitro activity of M1 against HCV genotype 1, its contribution to efficacy is expected to be similar to \nthat of dasabuvir. In addition, M1 is a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP family and \nOCT1 and thus, the hepatocyte concentration and thereby contribution to efficacy, may be larger than \ndasabuvir.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDasabuvir is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A. Following a \n400 mg 14C-dasabuvir dose in humans, unchanged dasabuvir was the major component (approximately \n60%) of drug related radioactivity in plasma. Seven metabolites were identified in plasma. The most \nabundant plasma metabolite was M1, which represented 21% of drug-related radioactivity (AUC) in \ncirculation following single dose; it’s formed via oxidative metabolism predominantly by CYP2C8. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing dosing of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir, mean plasma half-life of \ndasabuvir was approximately 6 hours. Following a 400 mg 14C-dasabuvir dose, approximately 94% of \nthe radioactivity was recovered in faeces with limited radioactivity (approximately 2%) in urine. \nUnchanged dasabuvir accounted for 26.2% and M1 for 31.5% of the total dose in faeces. M1 is mainly \ncleared through direct biliary excretion with the contribution of UGT-mediated glucuronidation and, to \na small extent, oxidative metabolism. \n \nDasabuvir does not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo and is not expected to inhibit \norganic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion transporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nextrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations; therefore, dasabuvir \ndoes not affect medicinal product transport by these proteins. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, a 10 year increase \nor decrease in age from 54 years (median age in the Phase 3 studies) would results in <10% change in \ndasabuvir exposures. There is no pharmacokinetic information in patients >75 years. \n \nSex or body weight \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, female subjects \nwould have approximately 14 to 30% higher dasabuvir exposures than male subjects. A 10 kg change \nin body weight from 76 kg (median weight in the Phase 3 studies) would result in <10% change in \ndasabuvir exposures. \n \nRace or ethnicity \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, Asian subjects \nhad 29% to 39% higher dasabuvir exposures than non-Asian subjects. \n  \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 150 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, \nwith dasabuvir 400 mg were evaluated in subjects with mild (CrCl: 60 to 89 ml/min), moderate (CrCl: \n30 to 59 ml/min) and severe (CrCl: 15 to 29 ml/min) renal impairment, relative to subjects with \nnormal renal function. \n \nIn subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, dasabuvir mean AUC values were 21% \nhigher, 37% higher and 50% higher, respectively. Dasabuvir M1 AUC values were 6% lower, 10% \nlower, and 13% lower, respectively.  \n \nThe changes in dasabuvir exposures in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment are \nnot considered to be clinically significant. Limited data in patients with end-stage renal disease \nindicate no clinically significant changes in exposure also in this patient group. No dose adjustment of \ndasabuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or end-stage-renal \ndisease on dialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetics of the combination of dasabuvir 400 mg, with ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir \n200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg were evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-\nPugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, relative to subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction. \n \nIn subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, dasabuvir AUC values were 17% \nhigher, 16% lower and 325% higher, respectively. The AUC values of dasabuvir M1 metabolite were \nunchanged, 57% lower, and 77% higher, respectively. Plasma protein binding of dasabuvir and its M1 \nmetabolite were not meaningfully different in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to normal \ncontrol subjects (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in paediatric patients has not \nbeen investigated (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDasabuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, \nchromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat micronucleus \nassays. \n \nDasabuvir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic mouse study up to the highest dosage tested \n(2 g/kg/day), resulting in dasabuvir AUC exposures approximately 19-fold higher than those in \nhumans at the recommended dose of 500 mg (250 mg twice daily). \n \nSimilarly, dasabuvir was not carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study up to the highest dose tested (800 \nmg/kg/day), resulting in dasabuvir exposures approximately 19-fold higher than those in humans at \n500 mg. \n \nDasabuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rodents and were not teratogenic \nin two species. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of offspring were \nreported. The highest dasabuvir dose tested produced exposures equal to 16 to 24-fold (rat) or 6-fold \n(rabbit) the exposures in humans at the maximum recommended clinical dose.  \n \nDasabuvir was the predominant component observed in the milk of lactating rats, without effect on \nnursing pups. Elimination half-life in rat milk was slightly shorter than in plasma, AUC was about 2 \nfold of that in plasma. Since dasabuvir is a BCRP substrate, distribution to the milk may change if this \ntransporter is inhibited or induced by co-administration of other medicinal products. Dasabuvir-\nderived material was minimally transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n  \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nExviera 250 mg film-coated tablets \ndasabuvir \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Exviera is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Exviera \n3. How to take Exviera \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Exviera \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Exviera is and what it is used for \n \nExviera contains the active substance dasabuvir. Exviera is an antiviral medicine used to treat adults \nwith chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (an infectious disease that affects the liver, caused by the hepatitis \nC virus).  \n \nExviera works by stopping the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and infecting new cells, thus \nclearing the virus from your blood over a period of time. \n \nExviera tablets do not work on their own. They are always taken with another antiviral medicine \ncontaining ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Some patients may also take an antiviral medicine called \nribavirin. Your doctor will talk with you about which of these medicines to take with Exviera. \n \nIt is very important that you also read the package leaflets for the other antiviral medicines that you \ntake with Exviera. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Exviera \n \nDo not take Exviera: \n• If you are allergic to dasabuvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n• If you have moderate to severe liver problems other than hepatitis C. \n• If you are taking any of the medicines listed in the following table. This is because serious or life-\n\nthreatening effects can occur when Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir are taken with \nthese medicines. These medicines can affect the way Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nwork and Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir can affect the way these other medicines \nwork. \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\nMedicines you must not take with Exviera \nMedicine or active substance Purpose of the medicine \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital for epilepsy \nefavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine for HIV infection \nApalutamide, enzalutamide for prostate cancer \nethinyloestradiol containing medicines such as \nthose contained in most contraceptive pills \nand vaginal rings used for contraception \n\nfor contraception \n\ngemfibrozil to lower cholesterol and other fats in the \nblood \n\nmitotane for some tumours of the adrenal glands \nrifampicin for bacterial infections \nSt. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) a herbal medicine for anxiety and mild \n\ndepression. This medicine is available \nwithout a prescription \n\n \nDo not take Exviera if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Exviera. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Exviera if you: \n- have liver disease other than hepatitis C; \n- have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to monitor \nyou more closely. \n- have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or adjustment of \nyour diabetes medicines after starting Exviera. Some diabetic patients have experienced low sugar \nlevels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines like Exviera. \n \nWhen taking Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, tell your doctor if you have the following \nsymptoms as they may be a sign of worsening liver problems:  \n- Feel sick (nauseous), are sick (vomit) or lose your appetite. \n- Notice yellowing of your skin or eyes. \n- Your urine is darker than normal. \n- Confusion \n- Notice swelling of your stomach area \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nExviera. \n \nTell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including \nsuicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly \nin patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness or in patients taking ribavirin with \nthis medicine. You or your caregiver should also immediately inform your doctor of any changes in \nbehaviour or mood and of any suicidal thoughts you may have. \n \nBlood tests \nYour doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Exviera. This is so that \nyour doctor can: \n• Decide what other medicines you should take with Exviera and for how long. \n• Confirm if your treatment has worked and if you are free of the hepatitis C virus. \n• Check for side effects of Exviera or other antiviral medicines your doctor has prescribed for you to \n\nuse with Exviera (such as “ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir” and “ribavirin”). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give Exviera to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Exviera in children \nand adolescents has not yet been studied. \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \nOther medicines and Exviera \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nThere are some medicines you must not take with Exviera - see the previous table “Medicines you \nmust not take with Exviera”. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Exviera, if you are taking any of the medicines in the \ntable below. The doctor may need to change your dose of these medicines. Tell your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Exviera if you are also using hormonal contraceptives. See the section on \ncontraception below. \n \n\nMedicines you must tell your doctor about before taking Exviera \nMedicine or active substance Purpose of the medicine \nalprazolam, diazepam for anxiety, panic attacks and trouble \n\nsleeping \nciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus to suppress the immune system \ncyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol for muscle spasms \ndabigatran to thin the blood \ndeferasirox to help reduce iron levels in the blood  \ndigoxin, amlodipine for heart problems or high blood \n\npressure \nfurosemide for the build-up of too much fluid in \n\nthe body \nhydrocodone for pain \nimatinib for the treatment of some cancers of \n\nthe blood \nlevothyroxine for thyroid problems \ndarunavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, rilpivirine for HIV infection  \nomeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole for stomach ulcers and other stomach \n\nproblems \nrosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin  to lower blood cholesterol \ns-mephenytoin for epilepsy \nteriflunomide for multiple sclerosis \nsulfasalazine to treat and manage inflammatory \n\nbowel disease or to treat rheumatoid \narthritis \n\nwarfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin \nK antagonists* \n\nto thin the blood \n\n*Your doctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood \ncan clot. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nExviera. \n \nPregnancy and contraception  \n \nThe effects of Exviera during pregnancy are not known. Exviera should not be used during pregnancy \nor in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. \n \n• You or your partner must use an effective method of contraception during treatment. \n\nContraceptive medicines that contains ethinyloestradiol cannot be used in combination with \nExviera. Ask your doctor about the best contraception for you. \n\n  \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nExtra precautions are needed if Exviera is taken together with ribavirin. Ribavirin may cause severe \nbirth defects. Ribavirin stays for a long time in the body after treatment is stopped, and effective \ncontraception is therefore needed both during treatment and for some time afterwards. \n \n\n• There is a risk for birth defects when ribavirin is given to a female patient that becomes \npregnant.  \n\n \n• There may also be a risk for birth defects if ribavirin is taken by a male patient, whose female \n\npartner becomes pregnant.  \n \n• Read the “Contraception” section of the package leaflet for ribavirin very carefully. It is \n\nimportant that both men and women read the information. \n \n• If you or your partner becomes pregnant during treatment with Exviera and ribavirin or in the \n\nmonths that follow, you must contact your doctor immediately. \n \nBreastfeeding \nYou should not breastfeed during treatment with Exviera. It is not known whether the active substance \nin Exviera (dasabuvir), passes into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome patients have reported feeling very tired when taking Exviera with other medicines for their \nhepatitis C infection. If you feel tired, do not drive or use any machines. \n \nExviera contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Exviera \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nExviera tablets do not work on their own. They are always taken with other antiviral medicines such as \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Your doctor may also give you an antiviral medicine called ribavirin. \n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is one tablet, twice a day. Take one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the \nevening. \n \nHow to take \n• Take the tablets with food. The type of food is not important. \n• Swallow the tablets whole with water.  \n• Do not chew, crush or break the tablets as they may have a bitter taste. \n \nHow long to take Exviera for \nYou will take Exviera for 8, 12 or 24 weeks. Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment will \nlast. Do not stop taking Exviera unless your doctor tells you to. It is very important that you complete \nthe full course of treatment. This will give the medicines the best chance to clear the hepatitis C virus \ninfection. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nIf you take more Exviera than you should \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose, you should contact your doctor or go to the \nnearest hospital straight away. Keep the medicine pack with you so you can easily describe what you \nhave taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Exviera \nIt is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. If you do miss a dose and it is: \n• More than 6 hours until your next dose - take the missed dose with food as soon as possible. \n• Less than 6 hours until your next dose - do not take the missed dose, take your next dose as usual \n\nwith food. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
