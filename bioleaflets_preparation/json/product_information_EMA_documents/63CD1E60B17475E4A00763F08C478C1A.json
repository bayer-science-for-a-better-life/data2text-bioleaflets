NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nImprida HCT 5 mg/160 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 5 mg of amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate), 160 mg of valsartan, \n\nand 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n\n \n\nWhite, ovaloid, biconvex tablets with bevelled edge, debossed “NVR” on one side and “VCL” on the \n\nother side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is \n\nadequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), \n\ntaken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component \n\nformulation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\nBefore switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the \n\nmonocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of \n\nthe individual components of the combination at the time of switching. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular \n\nfiltration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDue to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without \n\ncholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not \n\nsuitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nThere is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in \n\npatients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure \n\nand coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for \n\nthe indication of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nImprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some \n\nwater, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine \n\nderivatives, or to any of the excipients. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis. \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nExcessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with \n\nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of \n\nvalsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) \n\npatients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in \n\npatients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. \n\n \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nIf excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position \n\nand, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once \n\nblood pressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\nSerum electrolyte changes \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. \n\nIn other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum \n\nelectrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. \n\n \n\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at \n\nappropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk \n\nfactors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior \n\nelectrolyte imbalances. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not \n\nrecommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nTreatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including \n\npotassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery \n\nstenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent \n\nkidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised \n\nby the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of \n\npatients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been \n\nassociated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or \n\ndeath. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the \n\nmaximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient \n\npopulations is limited. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or \n\nobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in this population. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nOther metabolic disturbances \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of \n\nuric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum \n\ncalcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. \n\nSerum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. \n\n \n\nThe primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or \n\nsurgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk \n\nfactors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or \n\npenicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nCaution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, \n\nonly information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual \n\nactive substances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of \n\nother antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nValsartan \n\nand \n\nHCT \n\nLithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and \n\ntoxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE \n\ninhibitors and thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nDespite the lack of experience with concomitant use of \n\nvalsartan and lithium, this combination is not \n\nrecommended. If the combination proves necessary, \n\ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nValsartan Potassium-sparing \n\ndiuretics, potassium \n\nsupplements, salt \n\nsubstitutes containing \n\npotassium and other \n\nsubstances that may \n\nincrease potassium \n\nlevels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is \n\nconsidered necessary in combination with valsartan, \n\nfrequent monitoring of potassium plasma levels is \n\nadvised. \n\nAmlodipine Grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice is not recommended as bioavailability may be \n\nincreased in some patients, resulting in increased blood \n\npressure lowering effects. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nAmlodipine CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(i.e. ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, ritonavir) \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, \n\nmacrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil \n\nor diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in \n\namlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these \n\npharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in \n\nthe elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may \n\nthus be required. \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\n(anticonvulsant agents \n\n[e.g. carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, \n\nprimidone], rifampicin, \n\nHypericum perforatum \n\n[St. John’s wort]) \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers on amlodipine. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may \n\ngive a lower plasma concentration of amlodipine. \n\nAmlodipine should be used with caution together with \n\nCYP3A4 inducers. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n Simvastatin Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine \n\nwith 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in \n\nexposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It \n\nis recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg \n\ndaily in patients on amlodipine. \n\nDantrolene (infusion) In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and \n\ncardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and \n\nintravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalaemia, it is \n\nrecommended that the co-administration of calcium \n\nchannel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided in \n\npatients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the \n\nmanagement of malignant hyperthermia. \n\nValsartan \n\nand HCT \n\nNon-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory \n\nmedicines (NSAIDs), \n\nincluding selective \n\ncyclooxygenase-2 \n\ninhibitors (COX-2 \n\ninhibitors), \n\nacetylsalicylic acid \n\n(>3 g/day), and non-\n\nselective NSAIDs \n\nNSAIDS can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of both \n\nangiotensin II antagonists and hydrochlorothiazide when \n\nadministered simultaneously. Furthermore, concomitant \n\nuse of Imprida HCT and NSAIDs may lead to worsening \n\nof renal function and an increase in serum potassium. \n\nTherefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning \n\nof the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate \n\nhydration of the patient. \n\nValsartan Inhibitors of the uptake \n\ntransporter (rifampicin, \n\nciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue \n\nindicate that valsartan is a substrate of the hepatic uptake \n\ntransporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux \n\ntransporter MRP2. Co-administration of inhibitors of the \n\nuptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure \n\nto valsartan. \n\nHCT Alcohol, barbiturates \n\nor narcotics \n\nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with \n\nsubstances that also have a blood pressure lowering effect \n\n(e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic \n\nhypotension. \n\nAmantadine Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase \n\nthe risk of adverse reactions caused by amantadine. \n\nAnticholinergic agents \n\nand other medicinal \n\nproducts affecting \n\ngastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be \n\nincreased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, \n\nbiperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal \n\nmotility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it is \n\nanticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride \n\nmay decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\nAntidiabetic agents \n\n(e.g. insulin and oral \n\nantidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of \n\nthe antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary. \n\n Metformin Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk \n\nof lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nBeta blockers and \n\ndiazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic \n\neffect of diazoxide. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n Ciclosporin Concomitant treatment with ciclosporin may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperuricaemia and gout-type complications. \n\n Cytotoxic agents Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the \n\nrenal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \n\nmyelosuppressive effects. \n\n Digitalis glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of \n\ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n Iodine contrasting \n\nagents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an \n\nincreased risk of acute renal failure, especially with high \n\ndoses of iodine products. Patients should be re-hydrated \n\nbefore the administration. \n\n Ion exchange resins Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of \n\nthiazide diuretics. However, staggering the dosage of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and resin such that \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins \n\nwould potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum \n\npotassium level \n\nThe hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be \n\nincreased by concomitant administration of kaliuretic \n\ndiuretics, corticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic \n\nhormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G and salicylic acid derivatives or \n\nantiarrhythmics. If these medicinal products are to be \n\nprescribed with the amlodipine /valsartan \n\n/hydrochlorothiazide combination, monitoring of \n\npotassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum sodium \n\nlevel \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified \n\nby concomitant administration of medicinal products such \n\nas antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. \n\nCaution is indicated in long-term administration of these \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nthat could induce \n\ntorsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould be administered with caution when associated with \n\nmedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, \n\nin particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and \n\nsome antipsychotics. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nused in the treatment of \n\ngout (probenecid, \n\nsulfinpyrazone and \n\nallopurinol) \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be \n\nnecessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of \n\nserum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or \n\nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n Methyldopa There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia \n\noccurring with concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nand methyldopa. \n\n Non-depolarising \n\nskeletal muscle \n\nrelaxants (e.g. \n\ntubocurarine) \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of curare derivatives. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nOther anti-hypertensive \n\ndrugs \n\nThiazides potentiate the antihypertensive action of other \n\nantihypertensive drugs (e.g. guanethidine, methyldopa, \n\nbeta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, \n\nACE inhibitors, ARBs and Direct Renin Inhibitors \n\n[DRIs]). \n\nPressor amines (e.g. \n\nnoradrenaline, \n\nadrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor \n\namines such as noradrenaline.

Concomitant use \n\nof thiazide type diuretics may lead to hypercalcaemia in \n\npatients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. \n\nhyperparathyroidism, malignancy or vitamin-D-mediated \n\nconditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\nNo interaction \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nValsartan  Others \n\n(cimetidine, warfarin, \n\nfurosemide, digoxin, \n\natenolol, indometacin, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, \n\namlodipine, \n\nglibenclamide) \n\nIn monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical \n\nsignificance have been found with the following \n\nsubstances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, \n\natenolol, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, \n\nglibenclamide. \n\n \n\nSome of these substances could interact with the \n\nhydrochlorothiazide component of Imprida HCT (see \n\ninteractions related to HCT). \n\nAmlodipine Others In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin or \n\nciclosporin. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections \n\n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data \n\nwith the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contra-\n\nindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not \n\nrecommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\nAlternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, \n\nespecially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis \n\n(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When driving \n\nvehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness \n\nmay occur. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of Imprida HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nImprida HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nInformation on Imprida HCT \n\nThe safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one \n\ncontrolled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in \n\ncombination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and \n\ntransient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled \n\nclinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were \n\ndizziness and hypotension (0.7%). \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were \n\nobserved with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual \n\ntherapy components. \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the \n\ncombination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of \n\naction of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the \n\nhypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and

\n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with \n\nvalsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in \n\nexcessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged \n\nsystemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in \n\nrestoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. \n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nIf ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. \n\nAmlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and \n\nsymptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or \n\naccentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain anti-\n\narrhythmic medicinal products. \n\nThe degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with \n\ndihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: \n\nC09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium \n\nantagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these \n\nsubstances has an additive antihypertensive effect. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nImprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total \n\nof 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were \n\nassigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by \n\nweek 2. \n\n \n\nAt week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with \n\nImprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with \n\namlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple \n\ncombination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in \n\nreduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure \n\nwith Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, \n\n6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with \n\namlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after \n\nbeing on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved \n\nblood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual \n\ncombination therapies (45-54%) (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and \n\nstatistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with \n\nthe triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle \n\nand vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into \n\nthese cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels \n\nwith chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. \n\n \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The \n\nantihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the \n\nmaximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na\n+\nCl\n\n-\n symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl\n\n-\n site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nImprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations \n\nof amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, \n\nrespectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from \n\nImprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as \n\nbetween 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have \n\nshown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive \n\nmetabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for \n\n7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nAbsorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan \n\nare reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as \n\nmeasured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, \n\nalthough from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted \n\ngroups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in \n\nthe therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is \n\nabout 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is \n\nhighly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is \n\nrecovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations \n\n(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of \n\ndose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan \n\nis about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of \n\nvalsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 hours). \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nbound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in \n\nerythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. \n\n \n\nElimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours \n\nin the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on \n\nrepeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed \n\ndose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of \n\npassive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric patients (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this \n\nhas not been shown to have any clinical significance. \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nSince the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose \n\nregimens are recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As \n\nexpected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no \n\ncorrelation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nare increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of \n\napproximately 40–60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, \n\nexposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched \n\nby age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target \n\norgan toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in \n\nhumans. \n\n \n\nPreclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of \n\nred blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum \n\nurea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in \n\nthe kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after \n\na 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nThe amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or \n\ncarcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have \n\nbeen on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have \n\nbeen tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2 \nbasis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and \n\nbasophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney \n\nwhere the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were \n\nconsidered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged \n\nhypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy \n\nof the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is \n\nadequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), \n\ntaken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component \n\nformulation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\nBefore switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the \n\nmonocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of \n\nthe individual components of the combination at the time of switching. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular \n\nfiltration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDue to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without \n\ncholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not \n\nsuitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nThere is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in \n\npatients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure \n\nand coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for \n\nthe indication of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nImprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some \n\nwater, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine \n\nderivatives, or to any of the excipients. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis. \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nExcessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with \n\nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of \n\nvalsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) \n\npatients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in \n\npatients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. \n\n \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nIf excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position \n\nand, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once \n\nblood pressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\nSerum electrolyte changes \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. \n\nIn other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum \n\nelectrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. \n\n \n\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at \n\nappropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk \n\nfactors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior \n\nelectrolyte imbalances. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not \n\nrecommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nTreatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including \n\npotassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery \n\nstenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent \n\nkidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised \n\nby the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of \n\npatients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been \n\nassociated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or \n\ndeath. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the \n\nmaximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient \n\npopulations is limited. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or \n\nobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in this population. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nOther metabolic disturbances \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of \n\nuric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum \n\ncalcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. \n\nSerum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. \n\n \n\nThe primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or \n\nsurgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk \n\nfactors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or \n\npenicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nCaution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, \n\nonly information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual \n\nactive substances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of \n\nother antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nValsartan \n\nand \n\nHCT \n\nLithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and \n\ntoxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE \n\ninhibitors and thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nDespite the lack of experience with concomitant use of \n\nvalsartan and lithium, this combination is not \n\nrecommended. If the combination proves necessary, \n\ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nValsartan Potassium-sparing \n\ndiuretics, potassium \n\nsupplements, salt \n\nsubstitutes containing \n\npotassium and other \n\nsubstances that may \n\nincrease potassium \n\nlevels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is \n\nconsidered necessary in combination with valsartan, \n\nfrequent monitoring of potassium plasma levels is \n\nadvised. \n\nAmlodipine Grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice is not recommended as bioavailability may be \n\nincreased in some patients, resulting in increased blood \n\npressure lowering effects. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nAmlodipine CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(i.e. ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, ritonavir) \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, \n\nmacrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil \n\nor diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in \n\namlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these \n\npharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in \n\nthe elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may \n\nthus be required. \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\n(anticonvulsant agents \n\n[e.g. carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, \n\nprimidone], rifampicin, \n\nHypericum perforatum \n\n[St. John’s wort]) \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers on amlodipine. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may \n\ngive a lower plasma concentration of amlodipine. \n\nAmlodipine should be used with caution together with \n\nCYP3A4 inducers. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n Simvastatin Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine \n\nwith 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in \n\nexposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It \n\nis recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg \n\ndaily in patients on amlodipine. \n\nDantrolene (infusion) In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and \n\ncardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and \n\nintravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalaemia, it is \n\nrecommended that the co-administration of calcium \n\nchannel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided in \n\npatients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the \n\nmanagement of malignant hyperthermia. \n\nValsartan \n\nand HCT \n\nNon-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory \n\nmedicines (NSAIDs), \n\nincluding selective \n\ncyclooxygenase-2 \n\ninhibitors (COX-2 \n\ninhibitors), \n\nacetylsalicylic acid \n\n(>3 g/day), and non-\n\nselective NSAIDs \n\nNSAIDS can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of both \n\nangiotensin II antagonists and hydrochlorothiazide when \n\nadministered simultaneously. Furthermore, concomitant \n\nuse of Imprida HCT and NSAIDs may lead to worsening \n\nof renal function and an increase in serum potassium. \n\nTherefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning \n\nof the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate \n\nhydration of the patient. \n\nValsartan Inhibitors of the uptake \n\ntransporter (rifampicin, \n\nciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue \n\nindicate that valsartan is a substrate of the hepatic uptake \n\ntransporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux \n\ntransporter MRP2. Co-administration of inhibitors of the \n\nuptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure \n\nto valsartan. \n\nHCT Alcohol, barbiturates \n\nor narcotics \n\nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with \n\nsubstances that also have a blood pressure lowering effect \n\n(e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic \n\nhypotension. \n\nAmantadine Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase \n\nthe risk of adverse reactions caused by amantadine. \n\nAnticholinergic agents \n\nand other medicinal \n\nproducts affecting \n\ngastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be \n\nincreased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, \n\nbiperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal \n\nmotility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it is \n\nanticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride \n\nmay decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\nAntidiabetic agents \n\n(e.g. insulin and oral \n\nantidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of \n\nthe antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary. \n\n Metformin Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk \n\nof lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nBeta blockers and \n\ndiazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic \n\neffect of diazoxide. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n30 \n\n Ciclosporin Concomitant treatment with ciclosporin may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperuricaemia and gout-type complications. \n\n Cytotoxic agents Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the \n\nrenal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \n\nmyelosuppressive effects. \n\n Digitalis glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of \n\ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n Iodine contrasting \n\nagents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an \n\nincreased risk of acute renal failure, especially with high \n\ndoses of iodine products. Patients should be re-hydrated \n\nbefore the administration. \n\n Ion exchange resins Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of \n\nthiazide diuretics. However, staggering the dosage of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and resin such that \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins \n\nwould potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum \n\npotassium level \n\nThe hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be \n\nincreased by concomitant administration of kaliuretic \n\ndiuretics, corticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic \n\nhormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G and salicylic acid derivatives or \n\nantiarrhythmics. If these medicinal products are to be \n\nprescribed with the amlodipine /valsartan \n\n/hydrochlorothiazide combination, monitoring of \n\npotassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum sodium \n\nlevel \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified \n\nby concomitant administration of medicinal products such \n\nas antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. \n\nCaution is indicated in long-term administration of these \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nthat could induce \n\ntorsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould be administered with caution when associated with \n\nmedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, \n\nin particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and \n\nsome antipsychotics. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nused in the treatment of \n\ngout (probenecid, \n\nsulfinpyrazone and \n\nallopurinol) \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be \n\nnecessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of \n\nserum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or \n\nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n Methyldopa There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia \n\noccurring with concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nand methyldopa. \n\n Non-depolarising \n\nskeletal muscle \n\nrelaxants (e.g. \n\ntubocurarine) \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of curare derivatives. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\nOther anti-hypertensive \n\ndrugs \n\nThiazides potentiate the antihypertensive action of other \n\nantihypertensive drugs (e.g. guanethidine, methyldopa, \n\nbeta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, \n\nACE inhibitors, ARBs and Direct Renin Inhibitors \n\n[DRIs]). \n\nPressor amines (e.g. \n\nnoradrenaline, \n\nadrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor \n\namines such as noradrenaline.

In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections \n\n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data \n\nwith the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contra-\n\nindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not \n\nrecommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\nAlternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, \n\nespecially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day.

Adverse reactions were generally mild and \n\ntransient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled \n\nclinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were \n\ndizziness and hypotension (0.7%). \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were \n\nobserved with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual \n\ntherapy components. \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the \n\ncombination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of \n\naction of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the \n\nhypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and

\n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with \n\nvalsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in \n\nexcessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged \n\nsystemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in \n\nrestoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. \n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nIf ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. \n\nAmlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and \n\nsymptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or \n\naccentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain anti-\n\narrhythmic medicinal products. \n\nThe degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with \n\ndihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: \n\nC09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium \n\nantagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these \n\nsubstances has an additive antihypertensive effect. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nImprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total \n\nof 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were \n\nassigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by \n\nweek 2. \n\n \n\nAt week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with \n\nImprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with \n\namlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple \n\ncombination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in \n\nreduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure \n\nwith Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, \n\n6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with \n\namlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after \n\nbeing on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved \n\nblood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual \n\ncombination therapies (45-54%) (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and \n\nstatistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with \n\nthe triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle \n\nand vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into \n\nthese cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels \n\nwith chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. \n\n \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The \n\nantihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the \n\nmaximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na\n+\nCl\n\n-\n symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl\n\n-\n site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nImprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations \n\nof amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, \n\nrespectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from \n\nImprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as \n\nbetween 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have \n\nshown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive \n\nmetabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for \n\n7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nAbsorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan \n\nare reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as \n\nmeasured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, \n\nalthough from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted \n\ngroups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in \n\nthe therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is \n\nabout 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is \n\nhighly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is \n\nrecovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations \n\n(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of \n\ndose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan \n\nis about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of \n\nvalsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 hours). \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nbound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in \n\nerythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. \n\n \n\nElimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours \n\nin the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on \n\nrepeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed \n\ndose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of \n\npassive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric patients (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this \n\nhas not been shown to have any clinical significance. \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nSince the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose \n\nregimens are recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As \n\nexpected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no \n\ncorrelation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nare increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of \n\napproximately 40–60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, \n\nexposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched \n\nby age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target \n\norgan toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in \n\nhumans. \n\n \n\nPreclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of \n\nred blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum \n\nurea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in \n\nthe kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after \n\na 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\nThe amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or \n\ncarcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have \n\nbeen on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have \n\nbeen tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2 \nbasis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and \n\nbasophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney \n\nwhere the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nImprida HCT 5 mg/160 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 5 mg of amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate), 160 mg of valsartan, \n\nand 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n\n \n\nYellow, ovaloid, biconvex tablets with bevelled edge, debossed “NVR” on one side and “VEL” on the \n\nother side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is \n\nadequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), \n\ntaken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component \n\nformulation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\nBefore switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the \n\nmonocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of \n\nthe individual components of the combination at the time of switching. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular \n\nfiltration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDue to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without \n\ncholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not \n\nsuitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n45 \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nThere is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in \n\npatients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure \n\nand coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for \n\nthe indication of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nImprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some \n\nwater, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine \n\nderivatives, or to any of the excipients. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis. \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nExcessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with \n\nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of \n\nvalsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) \n\npatients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in \n\npatients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. \n\n \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nIf excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position \n\nand, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once \n\nblood pressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\nSerum electrolyte changes \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. \n\nIn other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum \n\nelectrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. \n\n \n\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at \n\nappropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk \n\nfactors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior \n\nelectrolyte imbalances. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not \n\nrecommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nTreatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including \n\npotassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery \n\nstenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent \n\nkidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised \n\nby the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of \n\npatients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been \n\nassociated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or \n\ndeath. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n47 \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the \n\nmaximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient \n\npopulations is limited. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or \n\nobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in this population. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nOther metabolic disturbances \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of \n\nuric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum \n\ncalcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. \n\nSerum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n48 \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. \n\n \n\nThe primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or \n\nsurgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk \n\nfactors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or \n\npenicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nCaution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, \n\nonly information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual \n\nactive substances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of \n\nother antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n49 \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nValsartan \n\nand \n\nHCT \n\nLithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and \n\ntoxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE \n\ninhibitors and thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nDespite the lack of experience with concomitant use of \n\nvalsartan and lithium, this combination is not \n\nrecommended. If the combination proves necessary, \n\ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nValsartan Potassium-sparing \n\ndiuretics, potassium \n\nsupplements, salt \n\nsubstitutes containing \n\npotassium and other \n\nsubstances that may \n\nincrease potassium \n\nlevels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is \n\nconsidered necessary in combination with valsartan, \n\nfrequent monitoring of potassium plasma levels is \n\nadvised. \n\nAmlodipine Grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice is not recommended as bioavailability may be \n\nincreased in some patients, resulting in increased blood \n\npressure lowering effects. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nAmlodipine CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(i.e. ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, ritonavir) \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, \n\nmacrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil \n\nor diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in \n\namlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these \n\npharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in \n\nthe elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may \n\nthus be required. \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\n(anticonvulsant agents \n\n[e.g. carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, \n\nprimidone], rifampicin, \n\nHypericum perforatum \n\n[St. John’s wort]) \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers on amlodipine. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may \n\ngive a lower plasma concentration of amlodipine. \n\nAmlodipine should be used with caution together with \n\nCYP3A4 inducers. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n Simvastatin Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine \n\nwith 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in \n\nexposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It \n\nis recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg \n\ndaily in patients on amlodipine. \n\nDantrolene (infusion) In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and \n\ncardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and \n\nintravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalaemia, it is \n\nrecommended that the co-administration of calcium \n\nchannel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided in \n\npatients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the \n\nmanagement of malignant hyperthermia. \n\nValsartan \n\nand HCT \n\nNon-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory \n\nmedicines (NSAIDs), \n\nincluding selective \n\ncyclooxygenase-2 \n\ninhibitors (COX-2 \n\ninhibitors), \n\nacetylsalicylic acid \n\n(>3 g/day), and non-\n\nselective NSAIDs \n\nNSAIDS can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of both \n\nangiotensin II antagonists and hydrochlorothiazide when \n\nadministered simultaneously. Furthermore, concomitant \n\nuse of Imprida HCT and NSAIDs may lead to worsening \n\nof renal function and an increase in serum potassium. \n\nTherefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning \n\nof the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate \n\nhydration of the patient. \n\nValsartan Inhibitors of the uptake \n\ntransporter (rifampicin, \n\nciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue \n\nindicate that valsartan is a substrate of the hepatic uptake \n\ntransporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux \n\ntransporter MRP2. Co-administration of inhibitors of the \n\nuptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure \n\nto valsartan. \n\nHCT Alcohol, barbiturates \n\nor narcotics \n\nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with \n\nsubstances that also have a blood pressure lowering effect \n\n(e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic \n\nhypotension. \n\nAmantadine Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase \n\nthe risk of adverse reactions caused by amantadine. \n\nAnticholinergic agents \n\nand other medicinal \n\nproducts affecting \n\ngastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be \n\nincreased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, \n\nbiperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal \n\nmotility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it is \n\nanticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride \n\nmay decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\nAntidiabetic agents \n\n(e.g. insulin and oral \n\nantidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of \n\nthe antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary. \n\n Metformin Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk \n\nof lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nBeta blockers and \n\ndiazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic \n\neffect of diazoxide. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n51 \n\n Ciclosporin Concomitant treatment with ciclosporin may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperuricaemia and gout-type complications. \n\n Cytotoxic agents Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the \n\nrenal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \n\nmyelosuppressive effects. \n\n Digitalis glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of \n\ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n Iodine contrasting \n\nagents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an \n\nincreased risk of acute renal failure, especially with high \n\ndoses of iodine products. Patients should be re-hydrated \n\nbefore the administration. \n\n Ion exchange resins Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of \n\nthiazide diuretics. However, staggering the dosage of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and resin such that \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins \n\nwould potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum \n\npotassium level \n\nThe hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be \n\nincreased by concomitant administration of kaliuretic \n\ndiuretics, corticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic \n\nhormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G and salicylic acid derivatives or \n\nantiarrhythmics. If these medicinal products are to be \n\nprescribed with the amlodipine /valsartan \n\n/hydrochlorothiazide combination, monitoring of \n\npotassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum sodium \n\nlevel \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified \n\nby concomitant administration of medicinal products such \n\nas antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. \n\nCaution is indicated in long-term administration of these \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nthat could induce \n\ntorsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould be administered with caution when associated with \n\nmedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, \n\nin particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and \n\nsome antipsychotics. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nused in the treatment of \n\ngout (probenecid, \n\nsulfinpyrazone and \n\nallopurinol) \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be \n\nnecessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of \n\nserum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or \n\nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n Methyldopa There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia \n\noccurring with concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nand methyldopa. \n\n Non-depolarising \n\nskeletal muscle \n\nrelaxants (e.g. \n\ntubocurarine) \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of curare derivatives. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n52 \n\nOther anti-hypertensive \n\ndrugs \n\nThiazides potentiate the antihypertensive action of other \n\nantihypertensive drugs (e.g. guanethidine, methyldopa, \n\nbeta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, \n\nACE inhibitors, ARBs and Direct Renin Inhibitors \n\n[DRIs]). \n\nPressor amines (e.g. \n\nnoradrenaline, \n\nadrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor \n\namines such as noradrenaline.

In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections \n\n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data \n\nwith the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contra-\n\nindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not \n\nrecommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\nAlternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, \n\nespecially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day.

In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When driving \n\nvehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness \n\nmay occur. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of Imprida HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nImprida HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nInformation on Imprida HCT \n\nThe safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one \n\ncontrolled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in \n\ncombination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and \n\ntransient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled \n\nclinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were \n\ndizziness and hypotension (0.7%). \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were \n\nobserved with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual \n\ntherapy components. \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the \n\ncombination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of \n\naction of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the \n\nhypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and

\n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with \n\nvalsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in \n\nexcessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged \n\nsystemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in \n\nrestoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. \n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nIf ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. \n\nAmlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n58 \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and \n\nsymptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or \n\naccentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain anti-\n\narrhythmic medicinal products. \n\nThe degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with \n\ndihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: \n\nC09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium \n\nantagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these \n\nsubstances has an additive antihypertensive effect. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nImprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total \n\nof 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were \n\nassigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by \n\nweek 2. \n\n \n\nAt week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with \n\nImprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with \n\namlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple \n\ncombination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in \n\nreduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure \n\nwith Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, \n\n6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with \n\namlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after \n\nbeing on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved \n\nblood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual \n\ncombination therapies (45-54%) (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and \n\nstatistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with \n\nthe triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n59 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle \n\nand vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into \n\nthese cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels \n\nwith chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. \n\n \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The \n\nantihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the \n\nmaximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na\n+\nCl\n\n-\n symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl\n\n-\n site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nImprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations \n\nof amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, \n\nrespectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from \n\nImprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as \n\nbetween 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have \n\nshown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive \n\nmetabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for \n\n7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nAbsorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan \n\nare reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as \n\nmeasured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, \n\nalthough from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted \n\ngroups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in \n\nthe therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is \n\nabout 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is \n\nhighly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is \n\nrecovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations \n\n(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of \n\ndose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan \n\nis about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of \n\nvalsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 hours). \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nbound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in \n\nerythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. \n\n \n\nElimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours \n\nin the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on \n\nrepeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed \n\ndose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of \n\npassive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n61 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric patients (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this \n\nhas not been shown to have any clinical significance. \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nSince the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose \n\nregimens are recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As \n\nexpected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no \n\ncorrelation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nare increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of \n\napproximately 40–60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, \n\nexposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched \n\nby age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target \n\norgan toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in \n\nhumans. \n\n \n\nPreclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of \n\nred blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum \n\nurea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in \n\nthe kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after \n\na 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n62 \n\nThe amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or \n\ncarcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have \n\nbeen on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have \n\nbeen tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2 \nbasis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and \n\nbasophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney \n\nwhere the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were \n\nconsidered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged \n\nhypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy \n\nof the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n63 \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n\n \n\nBrown-yellow, ovaloid, biconvex tablets with bevelled edge, debossed “NVR” on one side and \n\n“VHL” on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is \n\nadequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), \n\ntaken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component \n\nformulation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\nBefore switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the \n\nmonocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of \n\nthe individual components of the combination at the time of switching. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular \n\nfiltration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDue to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without \n\ncholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not \n\nsuitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n66 \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nThere is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in \n\npatients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure \n\nand coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for \n\nthe indication of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nImprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some \n\nwater, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine \n\nderivatives, or to any of the excipients. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis. \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nExcessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with \n\nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of \n\nvalsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) \n\npatients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in \n\npatients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. \n\n \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nIf excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position \n\nand, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once \n\nblood pressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\nSerum electrolyte changes \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. \n\nIn other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum \n\nelectrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. \n\n \n\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at \n\nappropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk \n\nfactors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior \n\nelectrolyte imbalances. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not \n\nrecommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nTreatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including \n\npotassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery \n\nstenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent \n\nkidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised \n\nby the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of \n\npatients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been \n\nassociated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or \n\ndeath. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n68 \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the \n\nmaximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient \n\npopulations is limited. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or \n\nobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in this population. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nOther metabolic disturbances \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of \n\nuric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum \n\ncalcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. \n\nSerum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n69 \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. \n\n \n\nThe primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or \n\nsurgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk \n\nfactors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or \n\npenicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nCaution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, \n\nonly information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual \n\nactive substances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of \n\nother antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n70 \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nValsartan \n\nand \n\nHCT \n\nLithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and \n\ntoxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE \n\ninhibitors and thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nDespite the lack of experience with concomitant use of \n\nvalsartan and lithium, this combination is not \n\nrecommended. If the combination proves necessary, \n\ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nValsartan Potassium-sparing \n\ndiuretics, potassium \n\nsupplements, salt \n\nsubstitutes containing \n\npotassium and other \n\nsubstances that may \n\nincrease potassium \n\nlevels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is \n\nconsidered necessary in combination with valsartan, \n\nfrequent monitoring of potassium plasma levels is \n\nadvised. \n\nAmlodipine Grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice is not recommended as bioavailability may be \n\nincreased in some patients, resulting in increased blood \n\npressure lowering effects. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nAmlodipine CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(i.e. ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, ritonavir) \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, \n\nmacrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil \n\nor diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in \n\namlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these \n\npharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in \n\nthe elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may \n\nthus be required. \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\n(anticonvulsant agents \n\n[e.g. carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, \n\nprimidone], rifampicin, \n\nHypericum perforatum \n\n[St. John’s wort]) \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers on amlodipine. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may \n\ngive a lower plasma concentration of amlodipine. \n\nAmlodipine should be used with caution together with \n\nCYP3A4 inducers. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n Simvastatin Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine \n\nwith 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in \n\nexposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It \n\nis recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg \n\ndaily in patients on amlodipine. \n\nDantrolene (infusion) In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and \n\ncardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and \n\nintravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalaemia, it is \n\nrecommended that the co-administration of calcium \n\nchannel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided in \n\npatients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the \n\nmanagement of malignant hyperthermia. \n\nValsartan \n\nand HCT \n\nNon-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory \n\nmedicines (NSAIDs), \n\nincluding selective \n\ncyclooxygenase-2 \n\ninhibitors (COX-2 \n\ninhibitors), \n\nacetylsalicylic acid \n\n(>3 g/day), and non-\n\nselective NSAIDs \n\nNSAIDS can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of both \n\nangiotensin II antagonists and hydrochlorothiazide when \n\nadministered simultaneously. Furthermore, concomitant \n\nuse of Imprida HCT and NSAIDs may lead to worsening \n\nof renal function and an increase in serum potassium. \n\nTherefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning \n\nof the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate \n\nhydration of the patient. \n\nValsartan Inhibitors of the uptake \n\ntransporter (rifampicin, \n\nciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue \n\nindicate that valsartan is a substrate of the hepatic uptake \n\ntransporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux \n\ntransporter MRP2. Co-administration of inhibitors of the \n\nuptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure \n\nto valsartan. \n\nHCT Alcohol, barbiturates \n\nor narcotics \n\nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with \n\nsubstances that also have a blood pressure lowering effect \n\n(e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic \n\nhypotension. \n\nAmantadine Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase \n\nthe risk of adverse reactions caused by amantadine. \n\nAnticholinergic agents \n\nand other medicinal \n\nproducts affecting \n\ngastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be \n\nincreased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, \n\nbiperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal \n\nmotility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it is \n\nanticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride \n\nmay decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\nAntidiabetic agents \n\n(e.g. insulin and oral \n\nantidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of \n\nthe antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary. \n\n Metformin Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk \n\nof lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nBeta blockers and \n\ndiazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic \n\neffect of diazoxide. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n72 \n\n Ciclosporin Concomitant treatment with ciclosporin may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperuricaemia and gout-type complications. \n\n Cytotoxic agents Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the \n\nrenal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \n\nmyelosuppressive effects. \n\n Digitalis glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of \n\ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n Iodine contrasting \n\nagents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an \n\nincreased risk of acute renal failure, especially with high \n\ndoses of iodine products. Patients should be re-hydrated \n\nbefore the administration. \n\n Ion exchange resins Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of \n\nthiazide diuretics. However, staggering the dosage of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and resin such that \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins \n\nwould potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum \n\npotassium level \n\nThe hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be \n\nincreased by concomitant administration of kaliuretic \n\ndiuretics, corticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic \n\nhormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G and salicylic acid derivatives or \n\nantiarrhythmics. If these medicinal products are to be \n\nprescribed with the amlodipine /valsartan \n\n/hydrochlorothiazide combination, monitoring of \n\npotassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum sodium \n\nlevel \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified \n\nby concomitant administration of medicinal products such \n\nas antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. \n\nCaution is indicated in long-term administration of these \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nthat could induce \n\ntorsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould be administered with caution when associated with \n\nmedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, \n\nin particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and \n\nsome antipsychotics. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nused in the treatment of \n\ngout (probenecid, \n\nsulfinpyrazone and \n\nallopurinol) \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be \n\nnecessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of \n\nserum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or \n\nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n Methyldopa There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia \n\noccurring with concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nand methyldopa. \n\n Non-depolarising \n\nskeletal muscle \n\nrelaxants (e.g. \n\ntubocurarine) \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of curare derivatives. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n73 \n\nOther anti-hypertensive \n\ndrugs \n\nThiazides potentiate the antihypertensive action of other \n\nantihypertensive drugs (e.g. guanethidine, methyldopa, \n\nbeta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, \n\nACE inhibitors, ARBs and Direct Renin Inhibitors \n\n[DRIs]). \n\nPressor amines (e.g. \n\nnoradrenaline, \n\nadrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor \n\namines such as noradrenaline.

Concomitant use \n\nof thiazide type diuretics may lead to hypercalcaemia in \n\npatients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. \n\nhyperparathyroidism, malignancy or vitamin-D-mediated \n\nconditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\nNo interaction \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nValsartan  Others \n\n(cimetidine, warfarin, \n\nfurosemide, digoxin, \n\natenolol, indometacin, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, \n\namlodipine, \n\nglibenclamide) \n\nIn monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical \n\nsignificance have been found with the following \n\nsubstances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, \n\natenolol, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, \n\nglibenclamide. \n\n \n\nSome of these substances could interact with the \n\nhydrochlorothiazide component of Imprida HCT (see \n\ninteractions related to HCT). \n\nAmlodipine Others In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin or \n\nciclosporin. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n74 \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections \n\n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data \n\nwith the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contra-\n\nindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not \n\nrecommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\nAlternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, \n\nespecially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis \n\n(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n75 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When driving \n\nvehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness \n\nmay occur. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of Imprida HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nImprida HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nInformation on Imprida HCT \n\nThe safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one \n\ncontrolled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in \n\ncombination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and \n\ntransient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled \n\nclinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were \n\ndizziness and hypotension (0.7%). \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were \n\nobserved with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual \n\ntherapy components. \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the \n\ncombination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of \n\naction of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the \n\nhypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and

\n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with \n\nvalsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in \n\nexcessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged \n\nsystemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in \n\nrestoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. \n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nIf ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. \n\nAmlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n79 \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and \n\nsymptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or \n\naccentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain anti-\n\narrhythmic medicinal products. \n\nThe degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with \n\ndihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: \n\nC09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium \n\nantagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these \n\nsubstances has an additive antihypertensive effect. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nImprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total \n\nof 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were \n\nassigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by \n\nweek 2. \n\n \n\nAt week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with \n\nImprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with \n\namlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple \n\ncombination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in \n\nreduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure \n\nwith Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, \n\n6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with \n\namlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after \n\nbeing on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved \n\nblood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual \n\ncombination therapies (45-54%) (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and \n\nstatistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with \n\nthe triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n80 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle \n\nand vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into \n\nthese cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels \n\nwith chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. \n\n \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The \n\nantihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the \n\nmaximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na\n+\nCl\n\n-\n symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl\n\n-\n site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nImprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations \n\nof amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, \n\nrespectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from \n\nImprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as \n\nbetween 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have \n\nshown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive \n\nmetabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for \n\n7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nAbsorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan \n\nare reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as \n\nmeasured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, \n\nalthough from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted \n\ngroups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in \n\nthe therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is \n\nabout 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is \n\nhighly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is \n\nrecovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations \n\n(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of \n\ndose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan \n\nis about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of \n\nvalsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 hours). \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nbound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in \n\nerythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. \n\n \n\nElimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours \n\nin the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on \n\nrepeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed \n\ndose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of \n\npassive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n82 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric patients (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this \n\nhas not been shown to have any clinical significance. \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nSince the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose \n\nregimens are recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As \n\nexpected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no \n\ncorrelation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nare increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of \n\napproximately 40–60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, \n\nexposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched \n\nby age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target \n\norgan toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in \n\nhumans. \n\n \n\nPreclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of \n\nred blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum \n\nurea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in \n\nthe kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after \n\na 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n83 \n\nThe amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or \n\ncarcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have \n\nbeen on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have \n\nbeen tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2 \nbasis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and \n\nbasophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney \n\nwhere the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were \n\nconsidered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged \n\nhypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy \n\nof the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n84 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is \n\nadequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), \n\ntaken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component \n\nformulation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\nBefore switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the \n\nmonocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of \n\nthe individual components of the combination at the time of switching. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular \n\nfiltration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDue to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without \n\ncholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not \n\nsuitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n87 \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nThere is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in \n\npatients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure \n\nand coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for \n\nthe indication of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nImprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some \n\nwater, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine \n\nderivatives, or to any of the excipients. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis. \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nExcessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with \n\nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of \n\nvalsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) \n\npatients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in \n\npatients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. \n\n \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nIf excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position \n\nand, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once \n\nblood pressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\nSerum electrolyte changes \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. \n\nIn other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum \n\nelectrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. \n\n \n\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at \n\nappropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk \n\nfactors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior \n\nelectrolyte imbalances. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not \n\nrecommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nTreatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including \n\npotassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery \n\nstenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent \n\nkidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised \n\nby the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of \n\npatients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been \n\nassociated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or \n\ndeath. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n89 \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the \n\nmaximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient \n\npopulations is limited. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or \n\nobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in this population. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nOther metabolic disturbances \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of \n\nuric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum \n\ncalcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. \n\nSerum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n90 \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. \n\n \n\nThe primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or \n\nsurgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk \n\nfactors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or \n\npenicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nCaution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, \n\nonly information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual \n\nactive substances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of \n\nother antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n91 \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nValsartan \n\nand \n\nHCT \n\nLithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and \n\ntoxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE \n\ninhibitors and thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nDespite the lack of experience with concomitant use of \n\nvalsartan and lithium, this combination is not \n\nrecommended. If the combination proves necessary, \n\ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nValsartan Potassium-sparing \n\ndiuretics, potassium \n\nsupplements, salt \n\nsubstitutes containing \n\npotassium and other \n\nsubstances that may \n\nincrease potassium \n\nlevels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is \n\nconsidered necessary in combination with valsartan, \n\nfrequent monitoring of potassium plasma levels is \n\nadvised. \n\nAmlodipine Grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice is not recommended as bioavailability may be \n\nincreased in some patients, resulting in increased blood \n\npressure lowering effects. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n \n\nImprida \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nAmlodipine CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(i.e. ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, ritonavir) \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, \n\nmacrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil \n\nor diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in \n\namlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these \n\npharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in \n\nthe elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may \n\nthus be required. \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\n(anticonvulsant agents \n\n[e.g. carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, \n\nprimidone], rifampicin, \n\nHypericum perforatum \n\n[St. John’s wort]) \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers on amlodipine. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may \n\ngive a lower plasma concentration of amlodipine. \n\nAmlodipine should be used with caution together with \n\nCYP3A4 inducers. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n Simvastatin Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine \n\nwith 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in \n\nexposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It \n\nis recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg \n\ndaily in patients on amlodipine. \n\nDantrolene (infusion) In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and \n\ncardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and \n\nintravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalaemia, it is \n\nrecommended that the co-administration of calcium \n\nchannel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided in \n\npatients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the \n\nmanagement of malignant hyperthermia. \n\nValsartan \n\nand HCT \n\nNon-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory \n\nmedicines (NSAIDs), \n\nincluding selective \n\ncyclooxygenase-2 \n\ninhibitors (COX-2 \n\ninhibitors), \n\nacetylsalicylic acid \n\n(>3 g/day), and non-\n\nselective NSAIDs \n\nNSAIDS can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of both \n\nangiotensin II antagonists and hydrochlorothiazide when \n\nadministered simultaneously. Furthermore, concomitant \n\nuse of Imprida HCT and NSAIDs may lead to worsening \n\nof renal function and an increase in serum potassium. \n\nTherefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning \n\nof the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate \n\nhydration of the patient. \n\nValsartan Inhibitors of the uptake \n\ntransporter (rifampicin, \n\nciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue \n\nindicate that valsartan is a substrate of the hepatic uptake \n\ntransporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux \n\ntransporter MRP2. Co-administration of inhibitors of the \n\nuptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure \n\nto valsartan. \n\nHCT Alcohol, barbiturates \n\nor narcotics \n\nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with \n\nsubstances that also have a blood pressure lowering effect \n\n(e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic \n\nhypotension. \n\nAmantadine Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase \n\nthe risk of adverse reactions caused by amantadine. \n\nAnticholinergic agents \n\nand other medicinal \n\nproducts affecting \n\ngastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be \n\nincreased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, \n\nbiperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal \n\nmotility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it is \n\nanticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride \n\nmay decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\nAntidiabetic agents \n\n(e.g. insulin and oral \n\nantidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of \n\nthe antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary. \n\n Metformin Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk \n\nof lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nBeta blockers and \n\ndiazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic \n\neffect of diazoxide. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n93 \n\n Ciclosporin Concomitant treatment with ciclosporin may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperuricaemia and gout-type complications. \n\n Cytotoxic agents Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the \n\nrenal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \n\nmyelosuppressive effects. \n\n Digitalis glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of \n\ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n Iodine contrasting \n\nagents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an \n\nincreased risk of acute renal failure, especially with high \n\ndoses of iodine products. Patients should be re-hydrated \n\nbefore the administration. \n\n Ion exchange resins Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of \n\nthiazide diuretics. However, staggering the dosage of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and resin such that \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins \n\nwould potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum \n\npotassium level \n\nThe hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be \n\nincreased by concomitant administration of kaliuretic \n\ndiuretics, corticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic \n\nhormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G and salicylic acid derivatives or \n\nantiarrhythmics. If these medicinal products are to be \n\nprescribed with the amlodipine /valsartan \n\n/hydrochlorothiazide combination, monitoring of \n\npotassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum sodium \n\nlevel \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified \n\nby concomitant administration of medicinal products such \n\nas antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. \n\nCaution is indicated in long-term administration of these \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nthat could induce \n\ntorsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould be administered with caution when associated with \n\nmedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, \n\nin particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and \n\nsome antipsychotics. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nused in the treatment of \n\ngout (probenecid, \n\nsulfinpyrazone and \n\nallopurinol) \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be \n\nnecessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of \n\nserum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or \n\nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n Methyldopa There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia \n\noccurring with concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nand methyldopa. \n\n Non-depolarising \n\nskeletal muscle \n\nrelaxants (e.g. \n\ntubocurarine) \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of curare derivatives. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n94 \n\nOther anti-hypertensive \n\ndrugs \n\nThiazides potentiate the antihypertensive action of other \n\nantihypertensive drugs (e.g. guanethidine, methyldopa, \n\nbeta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, \n\nACE inhibitors, ARBs and Direct Renin Inhibitors \n\n[DRIs]). \n\nPressor amines (e.g. \n\nnoradrenaline, \n\nadrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor \n\namines such as noradrenaline.

In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n95 \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections \n\n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data \n\nwith the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contra-\n\nindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not \n\nrecommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\nAlternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, \n\nespecially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis \n\n(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n96 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers.

When driving \n\nvehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness \n\nmay occur. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of Imprida HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nImprida HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nInformation on Imprida HCT \n\nThe safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one \n\ncontrolled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in \n\ncombination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and \n\ntransient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled \n\nclinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were \n\ndizziness and hypotension (0.7%). \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were \n\nobserved with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual \n\ntherapy components. \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the \n\ncombination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of \n\naction of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the \n\nhypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and

\n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with \n\nvalsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in \n\nexcessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged \n\nsystemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in \n\nrestoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. \n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nIf ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. \n\nAmlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n100 \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and \n\nsymptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or \n\naccentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain anti-\n\narrhythmic medicinal products. \n\nThe degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with \n\ndihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: \n\nC09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium \n\nantagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these \n\nsubstances has an additive antihypertensive effect. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nImprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total \n\nof 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were \n\nassigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by \n\nweek 2. \n\n \n\nAt week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with \n\nImprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with \n\namlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple \n\ncombination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in \n\nreduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure \n\nwith Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, \n\n6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with \n\namlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after \n\nbeing on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved \n\nblood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual \n\ncombination therapies (45-54%) (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and \n\nstatistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with \n\nthe triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n101 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle \n\nand vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into \n\nthese cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels \n\nwith chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. \n\n \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The \n\nantihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the \n\nmaximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na\n+\nCl\n\n-\n symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl\n\n-\n site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nImprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations \n\nof amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, \n\nrespectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from \n\nImprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as \n\nbetween 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have \n\nshown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive \n\nmetabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for \n\n7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nAbsorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan \n\nare reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as \n\nmeasured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, \n\nalthough from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted \n\ngroups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in \n\nthe therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is \n\nabout 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is \n\nhighly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is \n\nrecovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations \n\n(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of \n\ndose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan \n\nis about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of \n\nvalsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 hours). \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nbound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in \n\nerythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. \n\n \n\nElimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours \n\nin the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on \n\nrepeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed \n\ndose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of \n\npassive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n103 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric patients (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this \n\nhas not been shown to have any clinical significance. \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nSince the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose \n\nregimens are recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As \n\nexpected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no \n\ncorrelation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nare increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of \n\napproximately 40–60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, \n\nexposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched \n\nby age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target \n\norgan toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in \n\nhumans. \n\n \n\nPreclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of \n\nred blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum \n\nurea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in \n\nthe kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after \n\na 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n104 \n\nThe amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or \n\ncarcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have \n\nbeen on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have \n\nbeen tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2 \nbasis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and \n\nbasophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney \n\nwhere the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species.

Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nImprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nAll of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine \n\nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \n\nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called “thiazide diuretics”. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\nAs a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three \n\nsubstances. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IMPRIDA HCT \n\n \n\nDo not take Imprida HCT \n\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Imprida HCT in early \n\npregnancy – see Pregnancy section). \n\n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, \n\nsulphonamide-derived medicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections), or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of Imprida HCT (see section 6, “What Imprida HCT contains”). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n if you have liver disease, destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver (biliary cirrhosis) \n\nleading to the build up of bile in the liver (cholestasis). \n\n if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. \n\n if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n148 \n\n if the level of potassium or sodium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n if the level of calcium in your blood is too high despite treatment. \n\n if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Imprida HCT \n\n if you have a low level of potassium or magnesium in your blood (with or without symptoms \n\nsuch as muscle weakness, muscle spasms, abnormal heart rhythm). \n\n if you have a low level of sodium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as tiredness, \n\nconfusion, muscle twitching, convulsions). \n\n if you have a high level of calcium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as nausea, \n\nvomiting, constipation, stomach pain, frequent urination, thirst, muscle weakness and \n\ntwitching). \n\n if you are taking medicines or substances that increase the amount of potassium in your blood. \n\nThese include potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-\n\nsparing medicines and heparin. It may be necessary to check the amount of potassium in your \n\nblood at regular intervals. \n\n if you have kidney problems, have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have \n\na narrowing of your kidney arteries. \n\n if you have liver problems. \n\n if you have or have had heart failure or coronary artery disease, particularly if you are taking \nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) \n\n if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic \n\nor mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \n\n“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). \n\n if you suffer from aldosteronism. This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much \n\nof the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended. \n\n if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or \n\n“SLE”). \n\n if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of \n\nmedicine also known as “water tablets”), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies \n\n if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). \n\n if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Imprida HCT, tell your doctor \n\nas soon as possible. \n\n if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to a week of taking Imprida HCT. This can \n\nlead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at this stage (see section “Pregnancy and breast-\n\nfeeding”). \n\n \n\nThe use of Imprida HCT in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT and older people (age 65 years and older) \n\nImprida HCT can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults and in \n\nthe same way as they have already taken the three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. Elderly patients, particularly those taking the maximum dose of Imprida HCT \n\n(10 mg/320 mg/25 mg), should have their blood pressure checked regularly. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.

Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nImprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nAll of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine \n\nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \n\nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called “thiazide diuretics”. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\nAs a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three \n\nsubstances. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IMPRIDA HCT \n\n \n\nDo not take Imprida HCT \n\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Imprida HCT in early \n\npregnancy – see Pregnancy section). \n\n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, \n\nsulphonamide-derived medicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections), or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of Imprida HCT (see section 6, “What Imprida HCT contains”). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n if you have liver disease, destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver (biliary cirrhosis) \n\nleading to the build up of bile in the liver (cholestasis). \n\n if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. \n\n if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n159 \n\n if the level of potassium or sodium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n if the level of calcium in your blood is too high despite treatment. \n\n if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Imprida HCT \n\n if you have a low level of potassium or magnesium in your blood (with or without symptoms \n\nsuch as muscle weakness, muscle spasms, abnormal heart rhythm). \n\n if you have a low level of sodium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as tiredness, \n\nconfusion, muscle twitching, convulsions). \n\n if you have a high level of calcium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as nausea, \n\nvomiting, constipation, stomach pain, frequent urination, thirst, muscle weakness and \n\ntwitching). \n\n if you are taking medicines or substances that increase the amount of potassium in your blood. \n\nThese include potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-\n\nsparing medicines and heparin. It may be necessary to check the amount of potassium in your \n\nblood at regular intervals. \n\n if you have kidney problems, have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have \n\na narrowing of your kidney arteries. \n\n if you have liver problems. \n\n if you have or have had heart failure or coronary artery disease, particularly if you are taking \nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) \n\n if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic \n\nor mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \n\n“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). \n\n if you suffer from aldosteronism. This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much \n\nof the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended. \n\n if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or \n\n“SLE”). \n\n if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of \n\nmedicine also known as “water tablets”), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies \n\n if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). \n\n if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Imprida HCT, tell your doctor \n\nas soon as possible. \n\n if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to a week of taking Imprida HCT. This can \n\nlead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at this stage (see section “Pregnancy and breast-\n\nfeeding”). \n\n \n\nThe use of Imprida HCT in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT and older people (age 65 years and older) \n\nImprida HCT can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults and in \n\nthe same way as they have already taken the three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. Elderly patients, particularly those taking the maximum dose of Imprida HCT \n\n(10 mg/320 mg/25 mg), should have their blood pressure checked regularly. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n160 \n\n \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.

Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be \n\nconsumed by people who are taking Imprida HCT. This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can \n\nlead to an increase in the blood levels of the active substance amlodipine, which can cause an \n\nunpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect of Imprida HCT. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nPregnancy \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will \n\nnormally advise you to stop taking Imprida HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know \n\nyou are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Imprida HCT.

Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nImprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nAll of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine \n\nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \n\nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called “thiazide diuretics”. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\nAs a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three \n\nsubstances. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IMPRIDA HCT \n\n \n\nDo not take Imprida HCT \n\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Imprida HCT in early \n\npregnancy – see Pregnancy section). \n\n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, \n\nsulphonamide-derived medicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections), or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of Imprida HCT (see section 6, “What Imprida HCT contains”). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n if you have liver disease, destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver (biliary cirrhosis) \n\nleading to the build up of bile in the liver (cholestasis). \n\n if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. \n\n if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n170 \n\n if the level of potassium or sodium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n if the level of calcium in your blood is too high despite treatment. \n\n if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Imprida HCT \n\n if you have a low level of potassium or magnesium in your blood (with or without symptoms \n\nsuch as muscle weakness, muscle spasms, abnormal heart rhythm). \n\n if you have a low level of sodium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as tiredness, \n\nconfusion, muscle twitching, convulsions). \n\n if you have a high level of calcium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as nausea, \n\nvomiting, constipation, stomach pain, frequent urination, thirst, muscle weakness and \n\ntwitching). \n\n if you are taking medicines or substances that increase the amount of potassium in your blood. \n\nThese include potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-\n\nsparing medicines and heparin. It may be necessary to check the amount of potassium in your \n\nblood at regular intervals. \n\n if you have kidney problems, have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have \n\na narrowing of your kidney arteries. \n\n if you have liver problems. \n\n if you have or have had heart failure or coronary artery disease, particularly if you are taking \nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) \n\n if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic \n\nor mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \n\n“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). \n\n if you suffer from aldosteronism. This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much \n\nof the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended. \n\n if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or \n\n“SLE”). \n\n if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of \n\nmedicine also known as “water tablets”), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies \n\n if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). \n\n if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Imprida HCT, tell your doctor \n\nas soon as possible. \n\n if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to a week of taking Imprida HCT. This can \n\nlead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at this stage (see section “Pregnancy and breast-\n\nfeeding”). \n\n \n\nThe use of Imprida HCT in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT and older people (age 65 years and older) \n\nImprida HCT can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults and in \n\nthe same way as they have already taken the three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. Elderly patients, particularly those taking the maximum dose of Imprida HCT \n\n(10 mg/320 mg/25 mg), should have their blood pressure checked regularly. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n171 \n\n \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.

Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nImprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nAll of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine \n\nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \n\nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called “thiazide diuretics”. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\nAs a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three \n\nsubstances. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IMPRIDA HCT \n\n \n\nDo not take Imprida HCT \n\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Imprida HCT in early \n\npregnancy – see Pregnancy section). \n\n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, \n\nsulphonamide-derived medicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections), or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of Imprida HCT (see section 6, “What Imprida HCT contains”). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n if you have liver disease, destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver (biliary cirrhosis) \n\nleading to the build up of bile in the liver (cholestasis). \n\n if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. \n\n if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n181 \n\n if the level of potassium or sodium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n if the level of calcium in your blood is too high despite treatment. \n\n if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Imprida HCT \n\n if you have a low level of potassium or magnesium in your blood (with or without symptoms \n\nsuch as muscle weakness, muscle spasms, abnormal heart rhythm). \n\n if you have a low level of sodium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as tiredness, \n\nconfusion, muscle twitching, convulsions). \n\n if you have a high level of calcium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as nausea, \n\nvomiting, constipation, stomach pain, frequent urination, thirst, muscle weakness and \n\ntwitching). \n\n if you are taking medicines or substances that increase the amount of potassium in your blood. \n\nThese include potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-\n\nsparing medicines and heparin. It may be necessary to check the amount of potassium in your \n\nblood at regular intervals. \n\n if you have kidney problems, have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have \n\na narrowing of your kidney arteries. \n\n if you have liver problems. \n\n if you have or have had heart failure or coronary artery disease, particularly if you are taking \nthe maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) \n\n if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic \n\nor mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \n\n“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). \n\n if you suffer from aldosteronism. This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much \n\nof the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended. \n\n if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or \n\n“SLE”). \n\n if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of \n\nmedicine also known as “water tablets”), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies \n\n if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). \n\n if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Imprida HCT, tell your doctor \n\nas soon as possible. \n\n if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to a week of taking Imprida HCT. This can \n\nlead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Imprida HCT is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at this stage (see section “Pregnancy and breast-\n\nfeeding”). \n\n \n\nThe use of Imprida HCT in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT and older people (age 65 years and older) \n\nImprida HCT can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults and in \n\nthe same way as they have already taken the three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. Elderly patients, particularly those taking the maximum dose of Imprida HCT \n\n(10 mg/320 mg/25 mg), should have their blood pressure checked regularly. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n182 \n\n \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.

Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nImprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nAll of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine \n\nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \n\nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called “thiazide diuretics”. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\nAs a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nImprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three \n\nsubstances. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IMPRIDA HCT \n\n \n\nDo not take Imprida HCT \n\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant.
