NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nVerkazia 1 mg/mL eye drops, emulsion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne mL of emulsion contains 1 mg of ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: \n\n \n\nOne mL of emulsion contains 0.05 mg cetalkonium chloride (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nEye drops, emulsion. \n\nMilky white emulsion. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n\n \n\nTreatment of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) in children from 4 years of age and \n\nadolescents.   \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nVerkazia treatment must be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional qualified in \n\nophthalmology. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nChildren from 4 years of age and adolescents  \n\nThe recommended dose is one drop of Verkazia 4 times a day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening) \n\nto be applied to each affected eye during the VKC season. If signs and symptoms of VKC persist after \n\nthe end of the season, the treatment can be maintained at the recommended dose or decreased to one \n\ndrop twice daily once adequate control of signs and symptoms is achieved. Treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued after signs and symptoms are resolved, and reinitiated upon their recurrence. \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety of Verkazia have not been studied beyond 12 months. (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued on the next instillation as normal. Patients should be \n\nadvised not to instill more than one drop for each instillation in the affected eye(s). \n\n \n\nChildren below 4 years \n\nThere is no relevant use of Verkazia in children below 4 years in the treatment of severe vernal \n\nkeratoconjunctivitis. \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe effect of Verkazia has not been studied in patients above 18 years of age. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\nThe effect of Verkazia has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. However, no \n\nspecial dose adjustment is needed in these populations. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nOcular use \n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product \n\nPatients should be instructed to first wash their hands.  \n\nPrior to administration, the single-dose container should be gently shaken. \n\n \n\nFor single use only. Each single-dose container is sufficient to treat both eyes. Any unused emulsion \n\nshould be discarded immediately. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to use nasolacrimal occlusion and to close the eyelids for 2 minutes after \n\ninstillation, to reduce the systemic absorption. This may result in a decrease in systemic undesirable \n\neffects and an increase in local activity (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be \n\nadministered at least 15 minutes apart. Verkazia should be administered last (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\nOcular or peri-ocular malignancies or premalignant conditions  \n\nActive or suspected ocular or peri-ocular infection. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nContact lenses \n\nPatients wearing contact lenses have not been studied. Therefore, the use of Verkazia with contact \n\nlenses is not recommended.  \n\n \n\nConcomitant therapy \n\nCo-administration of Verkazia with eye drops containing corticosteroids may potentiate the effects of \n\nVerkazia on the immune system. However, in clinical studies, 18 patients received Verkazia (4 times \n\ndaily) in co-administration with eye drops containing corticosteroids and no increase in the risk of \n\nadverse reactions related to the immune system was identified. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with Verkazia.  (see section 4.5) \n\n \n\nEffects on the immune system \n\nOphthalmic medicinal products, which affect the immune system, including ciclosporin, may affect \n\nhost defences against local infections and malignancies. Therefore, regular examination of the eye(s) is \n\nrecommended, e.g. every 3 to 6 months, when Verkazia is used for more than 12 months.  \n\n \n\nVerkazia has not been studied in patients with an active orofacial herpes simplex infection, a history of \n\nocular herpes, varicella-zoster, or vaccinia virus infection and should therefore be used with caution in \n\nsuch patients. \n\n \n\nExcipient \n\nVerkazia contains cetalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment duration \n\nEfficacy and safety of Verkazia have not been studied beyond 12 months. Therefore, regular \n\nexamination of the eye(s) is recommended, e.g. every 3 to 6 months, when Verkazia is used for more \n\nthan 12 months. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed with Verkazia. \n\n \n\nCombination with other medicinal products that affect the immune system \n\nCo-administration of Verkazia with eye drops containing corticosteroids may potentiate the effects of \n\nVerkazia on the immune system. However, in clinical studies, 18 patients received Verkazia (4 times \n\ndaily) in co-administration with eye drops containing corticosteroids and no increase of the risk of \n\nadverse reactions related to the immune system were identified. (see section 4.4) \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \n\nVerkazia is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nThere are no data from the use of  Verkazia in pregnant women.  \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration of ciclosporin \n\nat exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little \n\nrelevance to the clinical use of  Verkazia. \n\n  \n\n Verkazia is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs \n\nthe potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nFollowing oral administration, ciclosporin is excreted in breast milk. There is insufficient information \n\non the effects of ciclosporin in newborns/infants. However, at therapeutic doses of ciclosporin in eye \n\ndrops, it is unlikely that sufficient amounts would be present in breast milk. A decision must be made \n\nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Verkazia therapy taking into \n\naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data on the effects of Verkazia on human fertility.  \n\n \n\nNo impairment of fertility has been reported in animals receiving intravenous ciclosporin (see \n\nsection 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nVerkazia has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product may induce temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances which may \n\naffect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised not to drive or \n\nuse machines until their vision has cleared. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most common adverse reactions in the clinicial trials with Verkazia were eye pain (11%) and eye \n\npruritus (9%) which were usually transitory and occurred during instillation.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following adverse reactions listed below were observed in clinical studies. They are ranked \n\naccording to system organ class and classified according to the following convention: very common \n\n(1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nvery rare (<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan class \n\nMedDRA \n\nfrequency \n\nAdverse reaction \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\nCommon Upper respiratory tract infection. \n\nUncommon Keratitis bacterial, herpes zoster ophthalmic. \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Headache. \n\nEye disorders Very common Eye pain. \n\nCommon Eye pruritus, ocular hyperaemia, eye irritation, ocular \n\ndiscomfort, foreign body sensation in eyes, lacrimation \n\nincreased, vision blurred, erythema of eyelid, eyelid \n\noedema. \n\nUncommon Blepharitis, conjunctival oedema. \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \n\nand mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Cough. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nA topical overdose is not likely to occur after ocular administration. If overdose with Verkazia occurs, \n\ntreatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, other ophthalmologicals, ATC code: S01XA18. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n\nFollowing ocular administration, ciclosporin is passively absorbed by T-lymphocytes where its \n\nbinding to cyclophilin A inactivates calcineurin, and prevents NF-AT translocation into the nucleus, \n\nthus blocking the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 and hence T-lymphocyte \n\nactivation. Blocking NF-AT also interferes in the allergy process. Ciclosporin inhibits histamine \n\nrelease from mast cells and basophils through a reduction in IL-5 production, and may reduce \n\neosinophil recruitment and effects on the conjunctiva and cornea. Ciclosporin is also known to up-\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nregulate the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. All available evidence suggests that ciclosporin \n\nacts specifically and reversibly on lymphocytes and does not depress haematopoiesis or have any \n\neffect on the function of phagocytic cells. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nIn a 12 month double-masked, vehicle controlled, pivotal clinical trial (VEKTIS study), 169 patients \n\nwith severe VKC and severe keratitis (grade 4 or 5 on the modified Oxford scale) were randomised to \n\n4 drops of Verkazia (high dose) or 2 drops of Verkazia (low dose) and 2 drops of vehicle or 4 drops of \n\nvehicle for the first 4 months (Period 1). Patients randomised to the vehicle group were switched to \n\nVerkazia (four times or twice daily) from Month 4 to Month 12 (Period 2). \n\n \n\n168 patients [127 children (75.6%) and 41 adolescents (24.4%)] were included in the efficacy \n\nanalyses. Mean age was 9.2 years (SD: 3.3, age range: 4-17 years). There were more male [n=132 \n\n(78.6%)] than female patients [n=36 (21.4%)]. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint which was the average penalties adjusted change of the Corneal \n\nFluorescein Staining (CFS) score from baseline and over Period 1, considered all patients (n=168). \n\nEfficacy was assessed every month during the 4 month treatment period and compared with baseline \n\nusing a composite criterion based on keratitis assessed by the modified Oxford scale, the need for \n\nrescue medicinal product (use of topical steroids) and the occurrence of corneal ulceration. \n\n \n\nThe difference in the Least Square (LS) mean vs. vehicle was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.27) for the high \n\ndose group and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.16, 1.18) for the low dose group. Both differences were statistically \n\nsignificant with p=0.007 for the high dose and p=0.010 for the low dose group. \n\n \n\nClinical relevance of the primary efficacy endpoint was however difficult to address. In that context, \n\nresponder rate’s results were considered as more reliable endpoint. A responder was defined as a \npatient 1) with a mean CFS score over the 4 months of treatment ≤ 50% of baseline, 2) who did not \nwithdraw from the study for a reason possibly due to treatment, 3) with no experience of corneal \n\nulceration and 4) no use of rescue medicinal product in the last 4 months of treatment. There was a \n\nsignificantly higher number of CFS responders in both active groups as compared to vehicle (p=0.005 \n\nfor the high dose group, and p=0.010 for the low dose group) with 55.4%, 50.0% and 27.6% of \n\nresponders in the high dose, low dose and vehicle groups respectively. The excess rate with respect to \n\nvehicle was 27.8% for the high dose regimen and 22.4% for the low dose one. \n\n \n\nRescue medicinal product (topical steroids) was used more often in the vehicle than in the high dose \n\nregimen: 32.1% in the high dose group and 31.5% in the low dose group received at least one course \n\nof rescue medicinal product while they were 53.4% in the vehicle group. \n\n \n\nAll four symptoms (photophobia, tearing, itching and mucous discharge) improved over time and the \n\ndifference from baseline at Month 4 for each symptom largely exceeded 10 mm.  \n\n \n\nFor the average of VKC symptoms, the difference in the LS mean vs. vehicle in the high dose group \n\nwas statistically significant at all time points compared to vehicle: -19.4 mm (p<0.05).  \n\n \n\nPatient quality of life (Quick questionnaire) improved significantly better in the high dose group \n\ncompared to vehicle. The improvement was clinically relevant as illustrated by the effect size over 4 \n\nmonths (symptoms domain: 0.67 and daily activities domain: 0.44).  \n\n \n\nIn Period 2, analyses demonstrated stability of improvements achieved during Period 1 for both doses \n\nregimen.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFormal pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in humans with Verkazia.  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nBlood concentrations of Verkazia were measured using a specific high-pressure liquid \n\nchromatography-mass spectrometry assay. In 166 patients at baseline from one efficacy study (55 \n\npatients in the high dose group, 53 in the low dose group and 58 in the vehicle group), plasma \n\nconcentrations of ciclosporin were measured before administration and after 2, 4 and 12 months of \n\ntreatment. \n\nIn the high dose group after 4 months of ocular instillation of Verkazia 4 times daily (n=50), 20 \n\npatients had values below the lower limit of detection (0.050 ng/mL) and 13 patients had values below \n\nthe lower limit of quantification (0.100 ng/mL). Quantifiable values not exceeding 0.670 ng/mL were \n\nmeasured in 14 patients, values considered to be negligible. Ciclosporinemia was not measured for 3 \n\npatients. At Month 12, (n= 68 patients) values were below the lower limit of detection for 38 patients \n\nand below the lower limit of quantification in 10 patients. 12 patients had measurable values \n\n(maximum 0.291 ng/mL), all considered to be negligible values. Ciclosporinemia was not measured \n\nfor 8 patients. \n\nIn the low dose group, after 4 months of ocular instillation of Verkazia 2 times daily (n= 47 patients), \n\n34 patients had values below the lower limit of detection (0.050 ng/mL) and 7 patients had values \n\nbelow the lower limit of quantification (0.100 ng/mL). Quantifiable values not exceeding \n\n0.336  ng/mL were measured in 5 patients, values considered to be negligible. Ciclosporinemia was \n\nnot measured for 1 patient. At Month 12 (n= 61 patients), values were below the lower limit of \n\ndetection for 47 patients and below the lower limit of quantification in 6 patients. 5 patients had \n\nmeasurable values (maximum 0.300 ng/mL), all considered to be negligible values. Ciclosporinemia \n\nwas not measured for 3 patients. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, phototoxicity and photoallergy, genotoxicity, carcinogenic \n\npotential, toxicity to reproduction and development. \n\n \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only with systemic administration or at exposures \n\nconsidered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to \n\nclinical use. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \n\nVerkazia 1 mg/mL eye drops emulsion \n\nciclosporin \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Verkazia is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Verkazia \n\n3. How to use Verkazia \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Verkazia \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Verkazia is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nVerkazia contains the active ingredient, ciclosporin. Ciclosporin reduces the activity of the body’s \nimmune (defence) system and in this way it reduces inflammation (body response to harmful stimuli). \n\n \n\nVerkazia is used to treat children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years with severe vernal \n\nkeratoconjunctivitis (an allergic condition of the eye that occurs more frequently in spring and affects \n\nthe transparent layer in the front part of the eye and the thin membrane covering the front part of the \n\neye).  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Verkazia \n\n \n\nDo not use Verkazia \n\n- if you are allergic to ciclosporin or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\n- if you have had or have a cancer in or around your eye. \n\n- if you have an eye infection. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nOnly use Verkazia in your eye as described under section 3. Do not exceed the treatment period \n\nprescribed by your doctor. \n\nVerkazia has not been studied in adult patients. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Verkazia: \n\n- if you have had an eye infection or if you suspect you have an eye infection  \n\n- if you have any other kind of eye disease \n\n- if you wear contact lenses (the use of Verkazia is not recommended with contact lenses). \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not use Verkazia in children under the age of 4 years. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Verkazia \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor if you are using eye drops containing steroids administered in association with \n\nVerkazia as this association may increase the risk of local infections.  \n\n \n\nIf you are using Verkazia for more than 12 months, you should visit your doctor regularly, e.g. every 3 \n\nto 6 months. \n\n \n\nIf you are using other eye drops, use Verkazia at least 15 minutes after using the other eye drops. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nVerkazia should not be used if you are pregnant. If you could become pregnant you must use \n\ncontraception while using this medicine. \n\n \n\nVerkazia is likely to be present in breast milk in very small amounts. If you are breast feeding talk to \n\nyour doctor before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYour vision may be temporarily blurred after using Verkazia eye drops or you may get other \n\ndisturbances with your vision. If this happens, wait until your vision clears before you drive or use \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\nVerkazia contains cetalkonium chloride  \n\nCetalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Verkazia \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nA caregiver should help a child starting Verkazia treatment, particularly if the child is aged under 10 \n\nyears, and should continue to supervise the child until the child is able to use Verkazia properly \n\nwithout help. \n \nThe recommended dose is 1 drop of Verkazia in each affected eye 4 times a day (morning, mid-day, \n\nafternoon and evening). You should continue Verkazia as prescribed by your doctor.  \n\n \n\nInstructions for use \n\nFollow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not \n\nunderstand. \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Wash your hands \n\n2. Open the aluminium pouch, which contains 5 single-dose containers \n\n3. Take 1 single-dose container from the aluminium pouch, leaving the remaining containers \n\nin the pouch  \n\n4. Gently shake the single-dose container \n\n5. Twist off the cap (picture 1) \n\n6. Pull down your lower eyelid (picture 2) \n\n7. Tilt your head back and look up at the ceiling \n\n8. Gently squeeze one drop of the medicine onto your eye. Make sure that the tip of the \n\nsingle-dose container does not touch your eye \n\n9. Blink a few times so that the medicine spreads across your eye \n\n10. After using Verkazia, press a finger lightly on the inner corner of your eyelid, next to your \n\nnose for 2 minutes (picture 3). A small duct that drains tears away from your eye and into \n\nyour nose is located here. By pressing at this point, you close down the opening of this \n\ndrainage duct. This helps to stop Verkazia getting into the rest of the body.  \n\n11. If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps 6 to 9 for your other eye. \n\n12. Discard the single-dose container as soon as you have used it, even if there is still some \n\nmedicine left in it \n\n \n\nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\nIf you put in more Verkazia than you should, rinse your eye with water. Do not put in any more \n\ndrops until it is time for your next regular dose. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Verkazia, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not take a double dose \n\nto make up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than 1 drop 4 times a day in the affected eye(s). \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Verkazia without speaking to your doctor, your eye allergy will not be controlled \n\nand could lead to long-term problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have been reported for Verkazia: \n\nThe most common side effects are in and around the eyes. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\nPain when the drops are put into the eye. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\nCommon side effects related to the eye: \n\nItching, redness, irritation and discomfort in or around the eye including a feeling that there is \n\nsomething in the eye. Increased watering of the eye and blurred vision when the drops are put into the \n\neye. Swelling and redness of eyelid. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects which are not related to the eye: \n\nUpper respiratory tract infection, cough, headache. \n\n  \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\nSwelling of the eyelid and of the conjunctiva (thin membrane covering the front part of the eye). \n\nBacterial infection of the cornea (transparent front part of the eye). Eye infection caused by herpes \n\nzoster virus. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Verkazia \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the outer carton, on the aluminium \n\npouch label, and on the single-dose containers label after “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day \nof that month. \n\n \n\nDo not freeze. \n\n \n\nStore below 30°C. \n\n \n\nKeep single-dose containers in the pouch in order to protect from light and avoid evaporation. \n\nDiscard the opened single-dose container immediately after use. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.
