NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADCIRCA 20 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 20 mg tadalafil. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 233 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nOrange and almond shaped film-coated tablets, marked \"4467\" on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nADCIRCA is indicated in adults for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) classified \nas WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity (see section 5.1). \n \nEfficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH related to collagen vascular disease. \n  \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of PAH. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 40 mg (2 x 20 mg) taken once daily with or without food. \n \nElderly patients \nDose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment a starting dose of 20 mg once per day is \nrecommended. The dose may be increased to 40 mg once per day, based on individual efficacy and \ntolerability. In patients with severe renal impairment the use of tadalafil is not recommended (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nDue to limited clinical experience in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh \nClass A and B), following single doses of 10 mg, a starting dose of 20 mg once per day may be \nconsidered. If tadalafil is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken \nby the prescribing physician. Patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) have not \nbeen studied and therefore dosing of tadalafil is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of ADCIRCA in the paediatric population has not yet been established.  \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nADCIRCA is for oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nAcute myocardial infarction within the last 90 days. \n \nSevere hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg). \n \n\n- In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is \nthought to result from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP \npathway. Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic \nnitrate is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n \nThe co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such \nas riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy \n(NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with previous PDE5 inhibitor \nexposure (see section 4.4). \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCardiovascular \n \nThe following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in PAH clinical \nstudies: \n \n- Patients with clinically significant aortic and mitral valve disease \n- Patients with pericardial constriction \n- Patients with restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy \n- Patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction \n- Patients with life-threatening arrhythmias \n- Patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease \n- Patients with uncontrolled hypertension. \n \nSince there are no clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in these patients, the use of tadalafil is not \nrecommended.  \n \nPulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary \nveno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Since there are no clinical data on administration of tadalafil to \npatients with veno-occlusive disease, administration of tadalafil to such patients is not recommended. \nShould signs of pulmonary oedema occur when tadalafil is administered, the possibility of associated \nPVOD should be considered.  \n \nTadalafil has systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. \nPhysicians should carefully consider whether their patients with certain underlying conditions, such as \nsevere left ventricular outflow obstruction, fluid depletion, autonomic hypotension or patients with \nresting hypotension, could be adversely affected by such vasodilatory effects. \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n \nIn patients who are taking alpha1 blockers concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead to \nsymptomatic hypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). Therefore, the combination of tadalafil \nand doxazosin is not recommended. \n \nVision \n \nVisual defects and cases of NAION have been reported in connection with the intake of tadalafil and \nother PDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in \nmen with erectile dysfunction following exposure to tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be \nrelevant for all patients exposed to tadalafil, the patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual \ndefect, he should stop taking ADCIRCA and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). \nPatients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not \nincluded in the clinical studies, and use in these patients is not recommended.  \n \nDecreased or sudden hearing loss \n \nCases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors \nwere present in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension, previous hearing loss history and \nassociated connective tissue diseases) patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention in \nthe event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \n \nDue to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to \ninfluence clearance by dialysis, tadalafil is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nPatients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied and, therefore, \ndosing of tadalafil is not recommended. \n \nPriapism and anatomical deformation of the penis \n \nPriapism has been reported in men treated with PDE5 inhibitors. Patients who experience erections \nlasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not \ntreated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result. \n \nTadalafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as \nangulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may \npredispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). \n \nUse with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors \n \nFor patients chronically taking potent inducers of CYP3A4, such as rifampicin, the use of tadalafil is \nnot recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nFor patients taking concomitant potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, the \nuse of tadalafil is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n \nTreatments for erectile dysfunction \n \nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for \nerectile dysfunction have not been studied. Patients should be informed not to take ADCIRCA with \nthese medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nProstacyclin and its analogues \n \nThe efficacy and safety of tadalafil co-administered with prostacyclin or its analogues has not been \nstudied in controlled clinical studies. Therefore, caution is recommended in case of co-administration. \n \nBosentan \n \nThe efficacy of tadalafil in patients already on bosentan therapy has not been conclusively \ndemonstrated (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nLactose \n \nADCIRCA contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other substances on tadalafil \n \nCytochrome P450 Inhibitors \n \nAzole Antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole) \nKetoconazole (200 mg daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) single dose exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax \nby 15 %, relative to the AUC and Cmax values for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) \nincreased tadalafil (20 mg) single dose exposure (AUC) 4-fold and Cmax by 22 %. \n \nProtease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir) \nRitonavir (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, \nincreased tadalafil (20 mg) single dose exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in Cmax. Ritonavir \n(500 mg or 600 mg twice daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32 % and \ndecreased Cmax by 30 %.  \n \nCytochrome P450 Inducers \n \nEndothelin-1 receptor antagonists (e.g. bosentan) \nBosentan (125 mg twice daily), a substrate of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of \nCYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly CYP2C19, reduced tadalafil (40 mg once per day) systemic exposure \nby 42 % and Cmax by 27 % following multiple dose co-administration. The efficacy of tadalafil in \npatients already on bosentan therapy has not been conclusively demonstrated (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). Tadalafil did not affect the exposure (AUC and Cmax) of bosentan or its metabolites. \nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other endothelin-1 receptor antagonists have \nnot been studied. \n \nAntimicrobial medicinal products (e.g. rifampicin) \nA CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin (600 mg daily), reduced tadalafil AUC by 88 % and Cmax by 46 %, \nrelative to the AUC and Cmax values for tadalafil alone (10 mg). \n \nEffects of tadalafil on other medicinal products \n \nNitrates \nIn clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of \nnitrates. This interaction lasted for more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nhad elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using \nany form of organic nitrate is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nAnti-hypertensives (including Calcium channel blockers) \nThe co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a \nsingle dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. \nThis effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore, this \ncombination is not recommended (see section 4.4). \nIn interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not \nreported with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. \n \nIn clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil (10 and 20 mg) to augment the hypotensive \neffects of antihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive \nmedicinal products were studied either as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy. In patients \ntaking multiple antihypertensive medicinal products whose hypertension was not well controlled, \ngreater reductions in blood pressure were observed compared to patients whose blood pressure was \nwell controlled, where the reduction was minimal and similar to that in healthy subjects. In patients \nreceiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a blood \npressure decrease, which (with the exception of doxazosin -see above) is, in general, minor and not \nlikely to be clinically relevant. \n \nRiociguat \nPreclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors \nwere combined with riociguat.  In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the \nhypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors.  There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the \ncombination in the population studied.  Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including \ntadalafil, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).   \n \nAlcohol \nAlcohol concentrations were not affected by co-administration with tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In \naddition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen after co-administration with alcohol. \nTadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or \napproximately 180 ml of 40 % alcohol [vodka] in an 80 kg male), but in some subjects, postural \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were observed. The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was \nnot augmented by tadalafil (10 mg). \n \nCYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline) \nWhen tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase \ninhibitor) there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect was a small \n(3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. \n \nCYP2C9 substrates (e.g.R-warfarin) \nTadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or \nR-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by \nwarfarin.  \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid \nTadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic \nacid.  \n \nP-glycoprotein substrates (e.g. digoxin) \nTadalafil (40 mg once per day) had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. \n \nOral contraceptive pill \nAt steady-state, tadalafil (40 mg once per day) increased ethinylestradiol exposure (AUC) by 26 % and \nCmax by 70 % relative to oral contraceptive administered with placebo.  There was no statistically \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nsignificant effect of tadalafil on levonorgestrel which suggests the effect of ethinylestradiol is due to \ninhibition of gut sulphation by tadalafil. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. \n \nTerbutaline \nA similar increase in AUC and Cmax seen with ethinylestradiol may be expected with oral \nadministration of terbutaline, probably due to inhibition of gut sulphation by tadalafil. The clinical \nrelevance of this finding is uncertain. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition \nor postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the \nuse of tadalafil during pregnancy.  \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk. \nA risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. ADCIRCA should not be used during breast feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nEffects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies \nsuggest that this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in \nsome men (see sections 5.1 and 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADCIRCA has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency of \nreports of dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical studies was similar, patients should be \naware of how they react to ADCIRCA, before driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 10 % of patients in the tadalafil 40 mg \ntreatment arm, were headache, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, flushing, myalgia, nasopharingitis and \npain in extremity. The adverse reactions reported were transient, and generally mild or moderate. \nAdverse reaction data are limited in patients over 75 years of age. \n \nIn the pivotal placebo-controlled study of ADCIRCA for the treatment of PAH, a total of 323 patients \nwere treated with ADCIRCA at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 40 mg once daily and 82 patients were \ntreated with placebo.  The duration of treatment was 16 weeks. The overall frequency of \ndiscontinuation due to adverse events was low (ADCIRCA 11 %, placebo 16 %). Three hundred and \nfifty seven (357) patients who completed the pivotal study entered a long-term extension study.  Doses \nstudied were 20 mg and 40 mg once daily.  \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below lists the adverse reactions reported during the placebo-controlled clinical study in \npatients with PAH treated with ADCIRCA.  Also included in the table are some adverse reactions \nwhich have been reported in clinical studies and/or post marketing with tadalafil in the treatment of \nmale erectile dysfunction.  These events have either been assigned a frequency of “Not known,” as the \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nfrequency in PAH patients cannot be estimated from the available data or assigned a frequency based \non the clinical study data from the pivotal placebo-controlled study of ADCIRCA. \n \nFrequency estimate: Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). \n \n\nVery common  Common  Uncommon  Rare  \n \n\nNot known1  \n\nImmune system disorders \n Hypersensitivity \n\nreactions5 \n  Angioedema \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache6 Syncope, \n\nMigraine5 \nSeizures5, \nTransient \namnesia5 \n\n Stroke2 \n(including \nhaemorrhagic \nevents) \n \n\nEye disorders \n Blurred vision   Non-arteritic \n\nanterior ischemic \noptic neuropathy \n(NAION), \nRetinal vascular \nocclusion, Visual \nfield defect \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n  Tinnitus  Sudden hearing \n\nloss \n\nCardiac disorders \n  Palpitations2, 5 Sudden cardiac \n\ndeath2, 5, \nTachycardia2, 5 \n \n\n Unstable angina \npectoris, \nVentricular \narrhythmia, \nMyocardial \nInfarction2  \n\nVascular disorders \nFlushing Hypotension Hypertension   \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nNasopharyngitis \n(including nasal \ncongestion, sinus \ncongestion and \nrhinitis) \n\nEpistaxis \n \n\n   \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nNausea, \nDyspepsia \n(including \nabdominal \npain/discomfort3) \n\nVomiting, \nGastroesophageal \nreflux \n\n   \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Rash Urticaria5, \n\nHyperhydrosis \n(sweating)5 \n\n Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome, \nExfoliative \ndermatitis \n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nMyalgia,  \nBack pain \nPain in extremity \n(including limb \ndiscomfort) \n \n\n    \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n  Haematuria   \nReproductive system and breast disorders  \n Increased uterine \n\nbleeding4 \nPriapism5, Penile \nhaemorrhage, \nHaematospermia \n\n Prolonged \nerections \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Facial oedema, \n\nChest pain2 \n   \n\n (1) Events not reported in registration studies and cannot be estimated from the available data.  The \nadverse reactions have been included in the table as a result of postmarketing or clinical study data \nfrom the use of tadalafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. \n(2) Most of the patients in whom these events have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk \nfactors. \n(3) Actual MedDRA terms included are abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, \nabdominal pain upper, and stomach discomfort. \n(4) Clinical non-MedDRA term to include reports of abnormal/excessive menstrual bleeding \nconditions such as menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, or vaginal hemorrhage. \n(5) The adverse reactions have been included in the table as a result of postmarketing or clinical study \ndata from the use of tadalafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction; and in addition, the frequency \nestimates are based on only 1 or 2 patients experiencing the adverse reaction in the pivotal placebo-\ncontrolled study of ADCIRCA.  \n(6) Headache was the most commonly reported adverse reaction. Headache may occur at the \nbeginning of therapy; and decreases over time even if treatment is continued.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to \n100 mg have been given to patients with erectile dysfunction.  Adverse reactions were similar to those \nseen at lower doses.  \nIn cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis \ncontributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC code: G04BE08. \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nTadalafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme \nresponsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).  Pulmonary arterial \nhypertension is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium and \nconsequent reduction of cGMP concentrations within the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle.  PDE5 \nis the predominant phosphodiesterase in the pulmonary vasculature.  Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil \nincreases the concentrations of cGMP resulting in relaxation of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle \ncell and vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nStudies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in \ncorpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, \nkidney, lung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other \nphosphodiesterases. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and \nPDE4, enzymes which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is \n> 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. \nThis selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac \ncontractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, \nan enzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also \n> 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 405 patients with pulmonary \narterial hypertension.  Allowed background therapy included bosentan (stable maintenance dose up to \n125 mg twice daily) and chronic anticoagulation, digoxin, diuretics and oxygen. More than half \n(53.3 %) of the patients in the study were receiving concomitant bosentan therapy. \n \nPatients were randomised to one of five treatment groups (tadalafil 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or \nplacebo). Patients were at least 12 years of age and had a diagnosis of PAH that was idiopathic, related \nto collagen disease, related to anorexigen use, related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \ninfection, associated with an atrial-septal defect, or associated with surgical repair of at least 1 year in \nduration of a congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt (for example, ventricular septal defect, patent \nductus arteriosus). The mean age of all patients was 54 years (range 14 to 90 years) with the majority \nof patients being Caucasian (80.5 %) and female (78.3 %). Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \netiologies were predominantly idiopathic PAH (61.0 %) and related to collagen vascular disease \n(23.5 %). The majority of patients had a World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class III \n(65.2 %) or II (32.1 %).  The mean baseline 6-minute-walk-distance (6MWD) was 343.6 meters. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at week 16 in 6-minute walk distance \n(6MWD). Only tadalafil 40 mg achieved the protocol defined level of significance with a placebo-\nadjusted median increase in 6MWD of 26 metres (p=0.0004; 95 % CI: 9.5, 44.0; Pre-specified \nHodges-Lehman method) (mean 33 metres, 95 % CI: 15.2, 50.3). The improvement in walk distance \nwas apparent from 8 weeks of treatment. Significant improvement (p<0.01) in the 6MWD was \ndemonstrated at week 12 when the patients were asked to delay taking study medicinal product in \norder to reflect trough active substance concentration. Results were generally consistent in subgroups \naccording to age, gender, PAH aetiology and baseline WHO functional class and 6MWD. The \nplacebo-adjusted median increase in 6MWD was 17 metres (p=0.09; 95 % CI: : -7.1, 43.0; Pre-\nspecified Hodges-Lehman method) (mean 23 metres, 95 % CI; -2.4, 47.8) in those patients who \nreceived tadalafil 40 mg in addition to their concomitant bosentan (n=39), and was 39 metres (p<0.01, \n95 % CI:13.0, 66.0; Pre-specified Hodges-Lehman method) (mean 44 metres, 95 % CI: 19.7, 69.0) in \nthose patients who received tadalafil 40 mg alone (n=37). \n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nThe proportion of patients with improvement in WHO functional class by week 16 was similar in the \ntadalafil 40 mg and placebo groups (23 % vs. 21 %).  The incidence of clinical worsening by week 16 \nin patients treated with tadalafil 40 mg (5 %; 4 of 79 patients) was less than placebo (16 %; 13 of 82 \npatients). Changes in the Borg dyspnoea score were small and non-significant with both placebo and \ntadalafil 40 mg. \n \nAdditionally, improvements compared to placebo were observed with tadalafil 40 mg in the physical \nfunctioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality and social functioning domains of the \nSF-36. No improvements were observed in the role emotional and mental health domains of the SF-\n36. Improvements compared to placebo were observed with tadalafil 40 mg in the EuroQol (EQ-5D) \nUS and UK index scores comprising mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, \nanxiety/depression components, and in the visual analogue scale (VAS). \n \nCardiopulmonary hemodynamics was performed in 93 patients. Tadalafil 40 mg increased cardiac \noutput (0.6 L/min) and reduced pulmonary artery pressures (-4.3 mmHg) and pulmonary vascular \nresistance (-209 dyn.s/cm5) compared to baseline (p<0.05). However, post hoc analyses demonstrated \nthat changes from baseline in cardiopulmonary hemodynamic parameters for the tadalafil 40 mg \ntreatment group were not significantly different compared to placebo. \n \nLong-term treatment \n357 patients from the placebo-controlled study entered a long-term extension study. Of these, 311 \npatients had been treated with tadalafil for at least 6 months and 293 for 1 year (median exposure 365 \ndays; range 2 days to 415 days). For those patients for which there are data, the survival rate at 1 year \nis 96.4 %. Additionally, 6 minute walk distance and WHO functional class status appeared to be stable \nin those treated with tadalafil for 1 year. \n \nTadalafil 20 mg administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to \nplacebo in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, \nrespectively), in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of \n0.2/4.6 mm Hg, respectively), and no significant change in heart rate.  \n \nIn a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination \n(blue/green) was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. This finding is consistent with \nthe low affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of \nchanges in colour vision were rare (< 0.1 %). \n \nThree studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of tadalafil \n10 mg (one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. In \ntwo of these studies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil \ntreatment of unlikely clinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other \nparameters such as motility, morphology and FSH. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nA single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) \nin which no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nparallel, 3-arm study of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving \nconcurrent corticosteroid therapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients \nwere randomised to tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show \nefficacy in slowing the decline in ambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance \n(6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean change in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the \nplacebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the \ntadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, there was no evidence of efficacy from any of the \nsecondary analyses performed in this study. The overall safety results from this study were generally \nconsistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with adverse events (AEs) expected in a \npaediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADCIRCA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n   \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nTadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma \nconcentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 4 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of \ntadalafil following oral dosing has not been determined. \nThe rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus ADCIRCA may be taken \nwith or without food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening after a single 10 mg administration) \nhad no clinically relevant effects on the rate and extent of absorption. \n \nDistribution  \n \nThe mean volume of distribution is approximately 77 l at steady state, indicating that tadalafil is \ndistributed into tissues. At therapeutic concentrations, 94 % of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. \nProtein binding is not affected by impaired renal function. \nLess than 0.0005 % of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major \ncirculating metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13,000-fold less \npotent than tadalafil for PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed \nmetabolite concentrations. \n \nElimination  \n \nThe mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 3.4 l/h at steady state and the mean terminal half-life is 16 \nhours in healthy subjects. Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the \nfaeces (approximately 61 % of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36 % of the \ndose).  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nOver a dose range of 2.5 to 20 mg, tadalafil exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose in \nhealthy subjects.  Between 20 mg to 40 mg, a less than proportional increase in exposure is observed.  \nDuring tadalafil 20 mg and 40 mg once daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations are attained \nwithin 5 days, and exposure is approximately 1.5 fold of that after a single dose. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics \n \nIn patients with pulmonary hypertension not receiving concomitant bosentan, the average tadalafil \nexposure at steady-state following 40 mg was 26 % higher when compared to those of healthy \nvolunteers. There were no clinically relevant differences in Cmax compared to healthy volunteers. The \nresults suggest a lower clearance of tadalafil in patients with pulmonary hypertension compared to \nhealthy volunteers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nHealthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25 % \nhigher exposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years after a 10 mg dose. This effect \nof age is not clinically significant and does not warrant a dose adjustment. \n \nRenal insufficiency \nIn clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) \napproximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate \n(creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease \non dialysis. In haemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41 % higher than that observed in healthy subjects. \nHaemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.  \nDue to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to \ninfluence clearance by dialysis, tadalafil is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nHepatic insufficiency \nTadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class \nA and B) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. If \ntadalafil is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the \nprescribing physician. There are no available data about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg \nof tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. \nPatients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied and therefore dosing \nof tadalafil in these patients is not recommended. \n \nPatients with diabetes \nTadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19 % lower than the AUC \nvalue for healthy subjects after a 10 mg dose. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose \nadjustment.  \n \nRace \nPharmacokinetic studies have included subjects and patients from different ethnic groups, and no \ndifferences in the typical exposure to tadalafil have been identified. No dose adjustment is warranted. \n \nGender \nIn healthy female and male subjects following single and multiple-doses of tadalafil, no clinically \nrelevant differences in exposure were observed. No dose adjustment is warranted. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received \nup to 1000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed \neffect dose was 30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free active substance at this \ndose was approximately 18 times the human AUC at a 20 mg dose. \n \nThere was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 12 \nmonths at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7 – 18.6] than \nseen in humans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous tubular \nepithelium that resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any of the side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See Section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What ADCIRCA is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take ADCIRCA \n3. How to take ADCIRCA \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store ADCIRCA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What ADCIRCA is and what it is used for \n \nADCIRCA contains the active substance tadalafil. \nADCIRCA is a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults. \n \nIt belongs to a group of medicines called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors which work by \nhelping the blood vessels around your lungs relax, improving the flow of blood into your lungs.  The \nresult of this is an improved ability to do physical activity. \n  \n \n2. What you need to know before you take ADCIRCA \n \nDo not take ADCIRCA if you: \n- are allergic to tadalafil or any of the other ingredients (see section 6). \n- are taking any form of nitrates such as amyl nitrite, used in the treatment of chest pain. \n\nADCIRCA has been shown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any \nform of nitrate or are unsure tell your doctor. \n\n- have ever had loss of vision – a condition described as “stroke of the eye” (non-arteritic anterior \nischemic optic neuropathy - NAION). \n\n- have had a heart attack in the last 3 months.  \n- have low blood pressure.  \n- are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high blood \n\npressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high blood \npressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots).  PDE5 inhibitors, such as ADCIRCA, have been \nshown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine.  If you are taking riociguat or are \nunsure tell your doctor. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking ADCIRCA. \nBefore taking the tablets, tell your doctor if you have: \n \n- any heart problems other than your pulmonary hypertension \n- problems with your blood pressure \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n- any hereditary eye disease \n- an abnormality of red blood cells (sickle cell anaemia) \n- cancer of the bone marrow (multiple myeloma) \n- cancer of the blood cells (leukaemia) \n- any deformation of your penis, or unwanted or persistent erections lasting more than 4 hours \n- a serious liver problem \n- a serious kidney problem. \n \nIf you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nDecreased or sudden hearing loss has been noted in some patients taking tadalafil. Although it is not \nknown if the event is directly related to tadalafil, if you experience decreased or sudden hearing loss, \ncontact your doctor immediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nADCIRCA is not indicated for use by children and adolescents under the age of 18. \n \nOther medicines and ADCIRCA \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nDo NOT take these tablets if you are already taking nitrates. \n \nSome medicines may be affected by ADCIRCA or they may affect how well ADCIRCA will work. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking: \n- bosentan (another treatment for pulmonary aterial hypertension) \n- nitrates (for chest pain) \n- alpha blockers used to treat high blood pressure or prostate problems. \n- riociguat. \n- rifampicin (to treat bacterial infections) \n- ketoconazole tablets (to treat fungal infections) \n- ritonavir (for HIV treatment) \n- tablets for erectile dysfunction (PDE5 inhibitors). \n \nADCIRCA with alcohol \nDrinking alcohol may temporarily lower your blood pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take \nADCIRCA, avoid excessive drinking (over 5 units of alcohol), since this may increase the risk of \ndizziness when standing up.  \n \nPregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Do not take ADCIRCA when pregnant, unless it is \nstrictly necessary and you have discussed this with your doctor. \n \nDo not breastfeed while taking these tablets as it is not known if the medicine passes into human \nbreast milk.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or \nbreastfeeding. \n \nWhen dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes.  A reduction in sperm \nwas seen in some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDizziness has been reported. Check carefully how you react to the medicines before driving or using \nany machinery. \n \nADCIRCA contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nADCIRCA contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take ADCIRCA \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nADCIRCA is supplied as a 20 mg tablet. The usual dose is two 20 mg tablets taken once a day.  You \nshould take both tablets at the same time, one after the other. If you have a mild or moderate liver or \nkidney problem, your doctor may advise you to take only one 20 mg tablet per day. \n \nSwallow the tablets whole with a drink of water.  The tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you take more ADCIRCA than you should  \nIf you or anyone else takes more tablets than they should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital \nimmediately, taking the medicine or pack with you. You may experience any of the side effects \ndescribed in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take ADCIRCA \nTake your dose as soon as you remember if it is within 8 hours of when you should have taken your \ndose.

Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. These \neffects are normally mild to moderate in nature. \n \nIf you experience any of the following side effects stop using the medicine and seek medical help \nimmediately: \n- allergic reactions including skin rashes (frequency common). \n\n- chest pain - do not use nitrates, but seek immediate medical assistance (frequency common). \n\n- priapism, a prolonged and possibly painful erection after taking ADCIRCA (frequency \nuncommon). If you have such an erection, which lasts continuously for more than 4 hours you \nshould contact a doctor immediately. \n\n- sudden loss of vision (rarely reported). \n\nThe following side effects have been very commonly reported in patients taking ADCIRCA (may \naffect more than 1 in 10 people):  headache, flushing, nasal and sinus congestion (blocked nose), \nnausea, indigestion (including abdominal pain or discomfort), muscle aches, back pain and pain in the \nextremity (including limb discomfort) \n \nOther side effects have been reported: \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- blurred vision, low blood pressure, nosebleed, vomiting, increased or abnormal uterine bleeding, \n\nswelling of the face, acid reflux,  migraine, irregular heartbeat and fainting. \n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1in 100 people) \n- seizures, passing memory loss, hives, excessive sweating, penile bleeding, presence of blood in \n\nsemen and/or urine, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, sudden cardiac death and ringing in the \nears. \n\n \nPDE5 inhibitors are also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men. Some side effects have \nbeen rarely reported: \n- Partial, temporary or permanent decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes and serious \n\nallergic reaction which causes swelling of the face or throat. Sudden decrease or loss of hearing \nhas also been reported. \n\n \nSome side effects have been reported in men taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  \nThese events were not seen in clinical studies for pulmonary arterial hypertension and therefore \nfrequency is unknown: \n- swelling of the eyelids, eye pain, red eyes, heart attack and stroke. \n\n \nMost but not all of those men reporting fast heart rate, irregular heartbeat, heart attack, stroke and \nsudden cardiac death had known heart problems before taking tadalafil. It is not possible to determine \nwhether these events were related directly to tadalafil. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.
