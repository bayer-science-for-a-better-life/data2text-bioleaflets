NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSkilarence 30 mg gastro-resistant tablets \nSkilarence 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nSkilarence 30 mg \nEach gastro-resistant tablet contains 30 mg dimethyl fumarate. \nSkilarence 120 mg \nEach gastro-resistant tablet contains 120 mg dimethyl fumarate. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nSkilarence 30 mg \nEach gastro-resistant tablet contains 34.2 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \nSkilarence 120 mg \nEach gastro-resistant tablet contains 136.8 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGastro-resistant tablet. \nSkilarence 30 mg \nWhite, film-coated, round, biconvex tablet with a diameter of approximately 6.8 mm. \nSkilarence 120 mg \nBlue, film-coated, round, biconvex tablet with a diameter of approximately 11.6 mm. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSkilarence is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults in need of \nsystemic medicinal therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nSkilarence is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. \n \nPosology \nTo improve tolerability, it is recommended to begin treatment with a low initial dose with subsequent \ngradual increases. In the first week, Skilarence 30 mg is taken once daily (1 tablet in the evening). In \nthe second week, Skilarence 30 mg is taken twice daily (1 tablet in the morning and 1 in the evening). \nIn the third week, Skilarence 30 mg is taken three times daily (1 tablet in the morning, 1 at midday, \nand 1 in the evening). From the fourth week, treatment is switched to only 1 tablet of \nSkilarence 120 mg in the evening. This dose is then increased by 1 Skilarence 120 mg tablet per week \nat different times of day for the subsequent 5 weeks, as shown in the table below. The maximum daily \ndose allowed is 720 mg (3 x 2 tablets of Skilarence 120 mg). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nWeek Number of tablets Total daily dose (mg) \n Morning Midday Evening of dimethyl fumarate  \n\nSkilarence 30 mg  \n1 0 0 1 30 \n2 1 0 1 60 \n3 1 1 1 90 \n\nSkilarence 120 mg  \n4 0 0 1 120 \n5 1 0 1 240 \n6 1 1 1 360 \n7 1 1 2 480 \n8 2 1 2 600 \n9+ 2 2 2 720 \n \nIf a particular dose increase is not tolerated, it may be temporarily reduced to the last tolerated dose. \n \nIf treatment success is observed before the maximum dose is reached, no further increase of dose is \nnecessary. After clinically relevant improvement of the skin lesions has been achieved, consideration \nshould be given to gradual reduction of the daily dose of Skilarence to the maintenance dose required \nby the individual. \n \nDosage modifications may also be necessary if abnormalities in laboratory parameters are observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nElderly patients \nClinical studies of Skilarence did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and above \nto determine whether they respond differently compared to patients under 65 years (see section 5.2). \nBased on the pharmacology of dimethyl fumarate, a need for dose adjustment in the elderly is not \nexpected. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \nSkilarence has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment, and use of Skilarence is \ncontraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \nSkilarence has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and use of Skilarence is \ncontraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Skilarence in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. There are no data available with Skilarence in paediatric patients. \n \nMethod of administration \nSkilarence is for oral use. \nSkilarence tablets must be swallowed whole with fluid during or immediately after a meal. \nThe coating of the gastro-resistant tablets is designed to prevent gastric irritation. Therefore, the tablets \nshould not be crushed, divided, dissolved or chewed. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n‒ Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n‒ Severe gastrointestinal disorders. \n‒ Severe hepatic or renal impairment. \n‒ Pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaematology \nSkilarence may decrease leukocyte and lymphocyte counts (see section 4.8). It has not been studied in \npatients with pre-existing low leukocyte or lymphocyte counts. \n \nBefore treatment \nPrior to initiating treatment with Skilarence, a current complete blood count (including differential \nblood count and platelet count) should be available. Treatment should not be initiated if leukopenia \nbelow 3.0x109/L, lymphopenia below 1.0x109/L or other pathological results are identified. \n \nDuring treatment \nDuring treatment a complete blood count with differential should be performed every 3 months. \nAction is needed in the following circumstances: \n \nLeukopenia: If a marked decrease in the total number of white blood cells is found, the situation \nshould be monitored carefully and treatment with Skilarence should be discontinued at levels below \n3.0x109/L. \n \nLymphopenia: If the lymphocyte count falls below 1.0x109/L but is ≥0.7 x109/L, blood monitoring \nshould be performed monthly until levels return to 1.0x109/L or higher for two consecutive blood tests \nat which point monitoring can again be performed every 3 months. \nIf the lymphocyte count falls below 0.7x109/L, the blood test must be repeated and if the levels are \nconfirmed to be below 0.7x109/L, then treatment must be stopped immediately. Patients developing \nlymphopenia should be monitored after stopping treatment until their lymphocyte count has returned \nto the normal range (see section 4.8). \n \nOther haematological disorders \nTherapy should be discontinued and caution is advised if other pathological results occur. In any case \nblood counts should be monitored until values have returned to the normal range. \n \nInfections \nSkilarence is an immunomodulator and may affect the way the immune system responds to infection. \nFor patients with pre-existing infections of clinical relevance, the physician should decide if treatment \nwith Skilarence should only be initiated once the infection has resolved. If a patient develops an \ninfection during treatment with Skilarence, suspension of treatment should be considered and the \nbenefits and risks should be reassessed prior to re-initiation of therapy. Patients receiving Skilarence \nshould be instructed to report symptoms of infection to a physician. \n \nOpportunistic infections/progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \nCases of opportunistic infections, particularly of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \nhave been reported with other dimethyl fumarate-containing products (see section 4.8). PML is an \nopportunistic infection caused by the John-Cunningham virus (JCV) that can be fatal or cause severe \ndisabilities. PML is probably caused by a combination of factors. \n \nA previous infection with JCV is considered a prerequisite for the development of PML. Risk factors \ncan include previous immunosuppressive treatment and the existence of certain concomitant disorders \n(such as some autoimmune disorders or malignant haematological conditions). A modified or \nweakened immune system as well as genetic or environmental factors can also constitute risk factors. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPersistent moderate or severe lymphopenia during treatment with dimethyl fumarate is also considered \na risk factor for PML. Patients who develop lymphopenia should be monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of opportunistic infections, particularly for symptoms indicative of PML. Typical \nsymptoms associated with PML are diverse, become worse over days to weeks and include \nprogressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision and \nchanges in thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. If PML is \nsuspected, treatment with Skilarence should be stopped immediately and further appropriate \nneurological and radiological examinations performed. \n \nPrior and concomitant treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies \nLimited data are available on the efficacy and safety of Skilarence in patients who have been \npreviously treated with other immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies. When switching \npatients from such therapies to Skilarence, the half-life and mode of action of the other therapy should \nbe considered in order to avoid additive effects on the immune system. \n \nNo data are available on the efficacy and safety of Skilarence when taken concomitantly with other \nimmunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies (see section 4.5). \n \nPre-existing gastrointestinal disease \nSkilarence has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease. Skilarence is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease (see sections 4.3). Gastrointestinal \ntolerability can be improved by following the dose titration schedule on initiating Skilarence treatment \nand by taking Skilarence with food (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nRenal function \nSince renal elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of Skilarence from plasma, it is unlikely \nthat renal impairment would affect the pharmacokinetic characteristics, and so a need for dose \nadjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is not expected (see sections 4.2 and \n5.2). \n \nDuring the Phase III placebo-controlled clinical trial, renal function was not seen to deteriorate during \ntherapy across treatment groups. However, Skilarence has not been studied in patients with severe \nrenal impairment, and some cases of renal toxicity have been reported during post-marketing \nsurveillance with fumaric acid esters. Hence, Skilarence is contraindicated in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal function (e.g. creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and urinalysis) should be checked prior to \ninitiation of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. In the event of a clinically relevant change in \nrenal function, particularly in the absence of alternative explanations, consideration should be given to \ndosage reduction or treatment discontinuation. \n \nFanconi syndrome \nEarly diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome and discontinuation of Skilarence treatment are important to \nprevent the onset of renal impairment and osteomalacia, as the syndrome is usually reversible. The \nmost important signs are: proteinuria, glucosuria (with normal blood sugar levels), \nhyperaminoaciduria and phosphaturia (possibly concurrent with hypophosphatemia). Progression \nmight involve symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia and proximal muscle weakness. In rare cases \nhypophosphataemic osteomalacia with non-localised bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase in \nserum and stress fractures may occur. Importantly, Fanconi syndrome can occur without elevated \ncreatinine levels or low glomerular filtration rate. In case of unclear symptoms Fanconi syndrome \nshould be considered and appropriate examinations should be performed. \n \nHepatic function \nSkilarence has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in \nthese patients (see section 4.3).  \n \nIt is recommended to monitor hepatic function (SGOT, SGPT, gamma-GT, AP) prior to initiation of \n\n\n\n6 \n\ntreatment and every 3 months thereafter, since elevation of hepatic enzymes has been observed in \nsome patients in the Phase III study. In the event of a clinically relevant change in hepatic parameters, \nparticularly in the absence of alternative explanations, consideration should be given to dose reduction \nor treatment discontinuation. \n \nFlushing \nPatients should be made aware that they are likely to experience flushing in the first few weeks of \ntaking Skilarence (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose \nSkilarence contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nSkilarence should be used cautiously in combination with other systemic antipsoriatic therapy (e.g. \nmethotrexate, retinoids, psoralens, ciclosporin, immunosuppressants or cytostatics) (see section 4.4). \nDuring treatment with Skilarence, simultaneous use of other fumaric acid derivatives (topical or \nsystemic) should be avoided. \n \nConcurrent therapy with nephrotoxic substances (e.g. methotrexate, ciclosporin, aminoglycosides, \ndiuretics, NSAIDs or lithium) may increase the potential for renal adverse reactions (e.g. proteinuria) \nin patients taking Skilarence. \n \nIn cases of severe or prolonged diarrhoea during treatment with Skilarence, absorption of other \nmedicinal products may be affected. Caution should be exercised when prescribing medicinal products \nwith a narrow therapeutic index that require absorption in the intestinal tract. The efficacy of oral \ncontraceptives may be reduced and the use of an alternative barrier contraceptive method is \nrecommended to prevent possible failure of contraception (see the prescribing information of the oral \ncontraceptive). \n \nConsumption of large quantities of strong alcoholic drinks (more than 30% alcohol by volume) should \nbe avoided because it may lead to increased dissolution rates of Skilarence and, therefore, may \nincrease the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. \n \nVaccination during treatment with Skilarence has not been studied. Immunosuppression is a risk factor \nfor the use of live vaccines. The risk of vaccination should be weighed against the benefit. \n \nThere is no evidence for Skilarence interaction with cytochrome P450 and the most common efflux \nand uptake transporters, thus no interactions are expected with medicinal products metabolised or \ntransported by these systems (see section 5.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential \nSkilarence is not recommended in women of child-bearing potential not using appropriate \ncontraception. In patients experiencing diarrhoea during Skilarence treatment, the effect of oral \ncontraceptives may be reduced and additional barrier methods of contraception may be necessary (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data from the use of dimethyl fumarate in pregnant women. Animal studies have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Skilarence is contraindicated during pregnancy (see \nsection 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether dimethyl fumarate or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to \nnewborns or infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Skilarence is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nThere are no human or animal data on the effects of Skilarence on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the ability to drive and use machines have been conducted. Skilarence may have a minor \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue may occur following \nadministration of Skilarence (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse reactions observed with Skilarence in the Phase III clinical study (1102) in \npsoriasis patients were gastrointestinal events (62.7%), flushing (20.8%) and lymphopenia (10.0%). \nMost adverse reactions were considered mild and did not lead to discontinuation of study treatment. \nThe only adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment in >5% of patients were \ngastrointestinal reactions. For monitoring recommendations and clinical management of adverse \nreactions, see section 4.4. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following is a list of adverse reactions experienced by patients treated with Skilarence during the \nclinical study and with Fumaderm, a related medicinal product containing dimethyl fumarate along \nwith other fumaric acid esters. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency \nInfections and infestations Herpes zoster Not known** \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nLymphopenia \nLeukopenia \nEosinophilia \nLeukocytosis \nAcute lymphatic leukaemia* \nIrreversible pancytopenia* \n\nVery common \nVery common \nCommon \nCommon \nVery rare \nVery rare \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nDecreased appetite Common \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \n\nParaesthesia \nDizziness* \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n\nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \nNot known \n\nVascular disorders Flushing Very common \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea \n\nAbdominal distension \nAbdominal pain \nNausea \nVomiting \nDyspepsia \nConstipation \n\nVery common \nVery common \nVery common \nVery common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency \nAbdominal discomfort \nFlatulence \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nErythema \nSkin burning sensation \nPruritus \nAllergic skin reaction \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nRare \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Proteinuria \nRenal failure \nFanconi syndrome* \n\nUncommon \nNot known \nNot known \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions  \n\nFatigue \nFeeling hot \nAsthenia \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nInvestigations Hepatic enzymes increased \nSerum creatinine increased \n\nCommon \nUncommon \n\n*Additional adverse reactions reported with Fumaderm, a related medicinal product containing dimethyl fumarate along with \nother fumaric acid esters. \n**Adverse reactions reported during post marketing experience. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nGastrointestinal disturbances \nData from the Phase III clinical study as well as from the literature show that gastrointestinal disorders \nwith dimethyl fumarate-containing products are most likely to occur during the first 2 to 3 months \nafter starting treatment. No apparent dose relationship and no risk factors for the occurrence of these \nadverse reactions could be identified. Diarrhoea was a common adverse reaction (36.9%) among \npatients taking Skilarence, leading to medicinal product withdrawal in about 10% of patients. More \nthan 90% of these diarrhoea events were of mild to moderate severity (see section 4.4). \n \nFlushing \nBased on observations in the Phase III clinical study as well as on literature data, flushing is most \nlikely to occur during the early weeks of treatment and tends to lessen with time. In the clinical study a \ntotal of 20.8% of patients receiving Skilarence experienced flushing, which was mild in the majority \nof cases (see section 4.4). Published clinical experience with dimethyl fumarate-containing products \nshows that individual episodes of flushing usually begin shortly after taking the tablets and resolve \nwithin a few hours. \n \nHaematological changes \nData from the Phase III clinical study as well as from the literature show that changes in \nhaematological parameters are most likely to occur during the first 3 months after starting treatment \nwith dimethyl fumarate. In particular, in the clinical study there was a slight decrease in mean \nlymphocyte counts starting between weeks 3 and 5 and reaching a maximum in week 12 where \napproximately one third of patients had lymphocyte values below 1.0x109/L. The mean and median \nvalues of lymphocytes remained within the normal range during the clinical study. At week 16 (end of \ntreatment), there was no further decline in lymphocyte counts. At week 16 of treatment, 13/175 (7.4%) \nof patients were noted to have lymphocyte levels <0.7x 109/L. Blood sampling for safety clinical \nlaboratory tests at follow-up visits was only performed in case of abnormalities at the preceeding visit. \nDuring the treatment free follow up, lymphocyte levels of <0.7x 109/L were observed in 1/29 (3.5%) \npatient at 6 months and 0/28 (0%) at 12 months after stopping treatment. At 12 months after stopping \ntreatment 3/28 (10.7%) of patients had lymphocyte values below 1.0x109/L, which would represent \n3/279 (1.1%) of the patients started on Skilarence. \n \nFor the total leukocyte count, a decline became apparent at week 12 of treatment; it slowly increased \nagain at week 16 (end of treatment); and 12 months after stopping treatment all patients had values \nabove 3.0x109/L. \n \nA transient increase in mean values of eosinophils was noted as early as week 3, reached a maximum \n\n\n\n9 \n\nat week 5 and 8, and had returned to baseline values at week 16.  \n \nFor monitoring recommendations and clinical management of haematological adverse reactions, see \nsection 4.4. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptomatic treatment is indicated in the case of an overdose. No specific antidote is known. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AX07 \n \nMechanism of action \nThe anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects of dimethyl fumarate and its metabolite \nmonomethyl fumarate are not fully elucidated but are thought to be mainly due to the interaction with \nthe intracellular reduced glutathione of cells directly involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This \ninteraction with glutathione leads to the inhibition of translocation into the nucleus and the \ntranscriptional activity of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB). \n \nThe main activity of dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate is considered to be \nimmunomodulatory, resulting in a shift in T helper cells (Th) from the Th1 and Th17 profile to a Th2 \nphenotype. The inflammatory cytokine production is reduced with induction of proapoptotic events, \ninhibition of keratinocyte proliferation, reduced expression of adhesion molecules, and diminished \ninflammatory infiltrate within psoriatic plaques. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and efficacy of Skilarence was assessed in one double-blind, 3-arm, placebo- and active \ncomparator-controlled Phase III study (1102) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis \n(Study 1102). 704 patients were randomised to receive Skilarence, an active comparator (Fumaderm, a \ncombination product with the same content of dimethyl fumarate plus 3 monoethyl fumarate salts) and \nplacebo in a ratio of 2:2:1. Patients began treatment with tablets containing 30 mg/day dimethyl \nfumarate or placebo, titrating up to a maximum of 720 mg/day in both active treatment arms as \ndescribed in section 4.2. If treatment success was observed before the maximum dose of 720 mg/day \nof dimethyl fumarate was reached, no further increase of dosage was necessary and the dosage was to \nbe steadily reduced to an individual maintenance dose. In case of individual intolerability of the \nincreased dosage during weeks 4 to 16, the patient was to return to the last tolerated dose taken since \nthe start of week 4, which was to be maintained until end of the treatment period (week 16). Patients \nreceived treatment for up to 16 weeks and follow-up visits were planned for up to 12 months after \ntreatment was stopped. \n \nThe demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups. Of \nthe 699 patients, most were Caucasian (99%) and male (65%), and the mean age was 44 years. Most \npatients (91%) were <65 years of age. Most patients had moderate psoriasis based on Psoriasis Area \nand Severity Index (PASI) and Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) scores at baseline: the mean \nPASI score at baseline was 16.35 and 60% of patients scored as moderate on the PGA. The majority of \npatients reported a “very large” or “extremely large” effect of psoriasis on their life based on the \nDermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), with a mean DLQI score of 11.5. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nAfter 16 weeks of treatment, Skilarence was found to be superior to placebo (p<0.0001) based on \nPASI 75 and PGA score clear or almost clear and non-inferior (using a non-inferiority margin \nof -15%) to the active comparator (p<0.0003) based on PASI 75.  \n \nSummary of clinical efficacy after 16 weeks treatment in Study 1102 \nAssessment Skilarence Placebo Fumaderm \n N=267 N=131 N=273 \nSuperiority testing vs placebo \nPASI 75, n (%) 100 (37.5) 20 (15.3) 110 (40.3) \n\np-value <0.0001a <0.0001a \n\nTwo-sided 99.24% CI 10.7, 33.7a 13.5, 36.6a \nPGA score clear or almost clear, n (%) 88 (33.0) 17 (13.0) 102 (37.4) \n\np-value <0.0001a <0.0001a \nTwo-sided 99.24% CI 9.0, 31.0 a 13.3, 35.5 a \n\n Skilarence Fumaderm \n N=267 N=273 \nNon-inferiority of Skilarence vs. Fumaderm   \nPASI 75, n (%) 100 (37.5) 110 (40.3) \n\np-value 0.0003b \nOne-sided 97.5% repeated CI (lower limit) -11.6b \n\nPGA score clear or almost clear, n (%) 88 (33.0) 102 (37.4) \np-value 0.0007b \nOne-sided 97.5% repeated CI (lower limit) -13.0b \n\nFumaderm = Active comparator, a combination product with the same content of dimethyl fumarate plus 3 monoethyl \nhydrogen fumarate salts; n=number of patients with available data; N=number of patients in population; PASI=Psoriasis \nArea Severity Index; PGA=Physician’s Global Assessment; a Superiority of Skilarence vs. Placebo with a difference of \n22.2% for PASI 75 and 20.0% for PGA score clear or almost clear, superiority of Fumaderm vs Placebo with a difference of \n25.0% for PASI 75 and 24.4% for PGA score clear or almost clear; b Non-inferiority of Skilarence vs. Fumaderm with a \ndifference of -2.8% for PASI 75 and -4.4% for PGA score clear or almost clear. \n \nThere was a trend in the efficacy endpoint PASI score mean % change from baseline, indicating the \nonset of a clinical response to Skilarence as early as week 3 (-11.8%) which became statistically \nsignificant compared to placebo by week 8 (-30.9%). Further improvement was seen by week 16 \n(-50.8%). \n \nThe benefits of treatment with Skilarence were also supported by patient self-perceived improvements \nin their quality of life. At week 16, patients treated with Skilarence had a lower mean DLQI compared \nto placebo (5.4 vs 8.8).  \n \nRebound (defined as worsening of ≥125% of baseline PASI value) was assessed after 2 months off \ntreatment and was shown not to be a clinical concern with fumaric acid esters, as it was documented in \nvery few patients (Skilarence 1.1% and active comparator 2.2%, compared to 9.3% in the placebo \ngroup).  \n \nLong-term efficacy data are currently not available for Skilarence, however, in the pharmacokinetic \nand clinical studies the systemic exposure, efficacy and safety of Skilarence were shown to be \ncomparable to the active comparator containing dimethyl fumarate. Hence it is reasonable to expect \nthe long-term efficacy of Skilarence to also be comparable to dimethyl fumarate-containing products. \nMaintenance of long term efficacy has been well described for other dimethyl fumarate-containing \nproducts, and therefore the treatment benefits seen with Skilarence at 16 weeks can be expected to be \nmaintained in patients treated over the long term for at least 24 months. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSkilarence in all subsets of the paediatric population in this indication (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter oral administration, dimethyl fumarate is not detected in plasma because it is rapidly hydrolysed \nby esterases to its active metabolite monomethyl fumarate. After oral administration of a single \nSkilarence 120 mg tablet in healthy subjects, monomethyl fumarate reached plasma peak \nconcentrations of around 1325 ng/mL and 1311 ng/mL under fasted or fed conditions, respectively. \nTaking Skilarence with food delayed the tmax of monomethyl fumarate from 3.5 to 9.0 hours. \n \nDistribution \nThe plasma protein binding of monomethyl fumarate is around 50%. Dimethyl fumarate does not \nshow any binding affinity to serum proteins which may further contribute to its rapid elimination from \nthe circulation. \n \nBiotransformation \nThe biotransformation of dimethyl fumarate does not involve cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. In vitro \nstudies have shown that monomethyl fumarate at the therapeutic dose does not inhibit or induce any of \nthe cytochrome P450 enzymes, it is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and is not an \ninhibitor of the most common efflux and uptake transporters. In vitro studies have shown that dimethyl \nfumarate at a therapeutic dose does not inhibit CYP3A4/5 and BCRP and is a weak P-glycoprotein \ninhibitor. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that hydrolysis of dimethyl fumarate to monomethyl fumarate occurs \nrapidly at pH 8 (pH in the small intestine), but not at pH 1 (pH in the stomach). A part of the total \ndimethyl fumarate is hydrolysed by esterases and the alkaline milieu of the small intestine, while the \nremainder enters the portal vein blood. Further studies have shown that dimethyl fumarate (and to a \nlesser extent monomethyl fumarate) reacts partially with reduced glutathione forming a glutathione-\nadduct. These adducts were detected in animal studies in the intestinal mucosa of rats and to a smaller \nextent in portal vein blood. Unconjugated dimethyl fumarate, however, cannot be detected in the \nplasma of animals or psoriatic patients following oral administration. By contrast, unconjugated \nmonomethyl fumarate is detectable in plasma. Further metabolism occurs through oxidation via the \ntricarboxylic acid cycle forming carbon dioxide and water. \n \nElimination \nExhalation of CO2 resulting from the metabolism of monomethyl fumarate is the primary route of \nelimination; only small amounts of intact monomethyl fumarate are excreted through urine or faeces. \nThe portion of dimethyl fumarate that reacts with glutathione, forming a glutathione-adduct, is \nmetabolised further to its mercapturic acid, which is excreted in the urine. \n \nThe apparent terminal elimination half-life of monomethyl fumarate is about 2 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nDespite the high inter-subject variability, the exposure measured as AUC and Cmax was generally \ndose-proportional after single dose administration of 4 x 30 mg dimethyl fumarate tablets (total dose \nof 120 mg) and 2 x 120 mg dimethyl fumarate tablets (total dose of 240 mg). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo specific studies have been performed in patients with renal impairment. However, because renal \nelimination plays a minor role in the total clearance from plasma, it is unlikely that renal impairment \nmay affect the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Skilarence (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo specific studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. However, as dimethyl \nfumarate is metabolised by esterases and the alkaline milieu of the small intestine without the \n\n\n\n12 \n\ninvolvement of cytochrome P450, hepatic impairment is not expected to influence exposure (see \nsection 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety pharmacology and genotoxicity data reveal no special hazard for humans. \n \nToxicology \nThe kidney was identified as a major target organ of toxicity in non-clinical studies. Renal findings in \ndogs included minimal to moderate tubular hypertrophy, increased incidence and severity of tubular \nvacuolation and minimal to slight tubular degeneration, which were considered toxicologically \nrelevant. The no-observed adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) after 3 months of treatment was \n30 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to 2.9-fold and 9.5-fold the human systemic exposure at the highest \nrecommended dose (720 mg/day), as AUC and Cmax values, respectively. \n \nReproduction toxicity \nNo fertility or pre- and post-natal development studies have been conducted with Skilarence. \n \nThere were no effects on foetal body weights or malformations attributed to maternal administration of \ndimethyl fumarate during the embryo-foetal development study in rats. However, there was an \nincreased number of foetuses with the variations “supernumerary liver lobe” and “abnormal iliac \nalignment” at maternally toxic doses. The NOAEL for maternal and embryo-foetal toxicity was \n40 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.2-fold and 2.0-fold the human systemic exposure at the highest \nrecommended dose (720 mg/day), as AUC and Cmax values, respectively. \n \nDimethyl fumarate has been shown to cross the placental membrane into foetal blood in rats. \n \nCarcinogenicity \nNo carcinogenicity studies have been performed for Skilarence. Based on available data suggesting \nthat fumaric acid esters may activate cellular pathways related to the development of renal tumours, a \npotential tumorigenic activity of exogenously administered dimethyl fumarate on the kidneys cannot \nbe excluded.  \n \n \n6.

What Skilarence is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Skilarence is \nSkilarence is a medicine that contains the active substance dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate \nworks on cells of the immune system (the body's natural defences). It changes the activity of the \nimmune system and reduces the production of substances involved in causing psoriasis. \n \nWhat Skilarence is used for \nSkilarence tablets are used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Psoriasis is a disease \ncausing thickened, inflamed, red areas on the skin, often covered by silvery scales. \n \nResponse to Skilarence can be generally seen as early as week 3 and improves over time. Experience \nwith related products containing dimethyl fumarate shows treatment benefit for at least up to \n24 months. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Skilarence \n \nDo not take Skilarence \n- if you are allergic to dimethyl fumarate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you have severe problems with your stomach or intestines \n- if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Skilarence. \n \nMonitoring \nSkilarence may cause problems with your blood, liver or kidneys. You will have blood and urine tests \nbefore treatment and then regularly during your treatment to make sure that you are not getting these \n\n\n\n29 \n\ncomplications and can continue to take this medicine. Depending on the results of these blood and \nurine tests, your doctor may reduce your dose of Skilarence or stop treatment. \n \nInfections \nWhite blood cells help your body to fight infections. Skilarence may reduce the number of your white \nblood cells. Talk to your doctor if you think you may have an infection. Symptoms include fever, pain, \naching muscles, headache, loss of appetite and a general feeling of weakness. If you have a serious \ninfection, either before starting treatment with Skilarence or during treatment, your doctor may advise \nyou not to take Skilarence until the infection has resolved. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nTell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your stomach or intestines.

What Skilarence is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Skilarence is \nSkilarence is a medicine that contains the active substance dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate \nworks on cells of the immune system (the body's natural defences). It changes the activity of the \nimmune system and reduces the production of substances involved in causing psoriasis. \n \nWhat Skilarence is used for \nSkilarence tablets are used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Psoriasis is a disease \ncausing thickened, inflamed, red areas on the skin, often covered by silvery scales. \n \nResponse to Skilarence can be generally seen as early as week 3 and improves over time. Experience \nwith related products containing dimethyl fumarate shows treatment benefit for at least up to \n24 months. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Skilarence \n \nDo not take Skilarence \n- if you are allergic to dimethyl fumarate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you have severe problems with your stomach or intestines  \n- if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Skilarence. \n \nMonitoring \nSkilarence may cause problems with your blood, liver or kidneys. You will have blood and urine tests \nbefore treatment and then regularly during your treatment to make sure that you are not getting these \n\n\n\n36 \n\ncomplications and can continue to take this medicine. Depending on the results of these blood and \nurine tests, your doctor may reduce your dose of Skilarence or stop treatment. \n \nInfections \nWhite blood cells help your body to fight infections. Skilarence may reduce the number of your white \nblood cells. Talk to your doctor if you think you may have an infection. Symptoms include fever, pain, \naching muscles, headache, loss of appetite and a general feeling of weakness. If you have a serious \ninfection, either before starting treatment with Skilarence or during treatment, your doctor may advise \nyou not to take Skilarence until the infection has resolved.  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nTell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your stomach or intestines. Your doctor will \nadvise you on what care you need to take during Skilarence treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nChildren and adolescents below the age of 18 years should not take this medicine because it has not \nbeen studied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Skilarence \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking the following: \n \n- Dimethyl fumarate or other fumarates. The active ingredient in Skilarence, dimethyl \n\nfumarate, is also used in other medicines such as tablets, ointments and baths. You must avoid \nusing other products that contain fumarates to prevent taking too much. \n\n- Other medicines used to treat psoriasis, such as methotrexate, retinoids, psoralens, \nciclosporin, or other immunosuppressants or cytostatics (medicines that affect the immune \nsystem). Taking these medicines with Skilarence could increase the risk of side effects on your \nimmune system. \n\n- Other medicines that can affect your kidney function, such as methotrexate or ciclosporin \n(used to treat psoriasis), aminoglycosides (used to treat infections), diuretics (which increase \nurine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (used to treat pain) or lithium (used for bipolar \ndisease and depression). These medicines taken together with Skilarence could increase the risk \nof side effects on your kidneys. \n\n \nIf you get severe or prolonged diarrhoea with Skilarence, other medicines may not work as well as \nthey should. Talk to your doctor if you have bad diarrhoea and are concerned that other medicines you \nare taking might not work. In particular, if you are taking a contraceptive medicine (the pill), the effect \nmay be reduced and you may need to use other barrier methods to prevent pregnancy. See the \ninstructions in the patient leaflet of the contraceptive you are taking. \n \nIf you need a vaccination, talk to your doctor.
