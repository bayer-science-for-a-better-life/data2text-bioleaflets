CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIclusig is indicated in adult patients with \n \n\n\uf0b7 chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who are \nresistant to dasatinib or nilotinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib and for whom \nsubsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I \nmutation \n\n\uf0b7 Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are resistant \nto dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is \nnot clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation. \n\n \nSee sections 4.2 for the assessment of cardiovascular status prior to start of therapy and 4.4 for \nsituations where an alternative treatment may be considered. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with \nleukaemia. Haematologic support such as platelet transfusion and haematopoietic growth factors can \nbe used during treatment if clinically indicated. \n \nBefore starting treatment with ponatinib, the cardiovascular status of the patient should be assessed, \nincluding history and physical examination, and cardiovascular risk factors should be actively \nmanaged. Cardiovascular status should continue to be monitored and medical and supportive therapy \nfor conditions that contribute to cardiovascular risk should be optimised during treatment with \nponatinib. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended starting dose is 45 mg of ponatinib once daily. For the standard dose of 45 mg once \ndaily, a 45 mg film-coated tablet is available. Treatment should be continued as long as the patient \ndoes not show evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n \nPatients should be monitored for response according to standard clinical guidelines.  \n \nDiscontinuing ponatinib should be considered if a complete haematologic response has not occurred \nby 3 months (90 days). \n \nThe risk of arterial occlusive events is likely to be dose-related. Reducing the dose of Iclusig to 15 mg \nshould be considered for CP-CML patients who have achieved a major cytogenetic response taking the \nfollowing factors into account in the individual patient assessment: cardiovascular risk, side effects of \nponatinib therapy, time to cytogenetic response, and BCR-ABL transcript levels (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). If dose reduction is undertaken, close monitoring of response is recommended. \n \nManagement of toxicities \n \nDose modifications or interruption of dosing should be considered for the management of \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicities. In the case of severe adverse reactions, treatment \nshould be withheld. \n \nFor patients whose adverse reactions are resolved or attenuated in severity, Iclusig may be restarted \nand escalation of the dose back to the daily dose used prior to the adverse reaction may be considered, \nif clinically appropriate. \n \nFor a dose of 30 mg or 15 mg once daily, 15 mg and 30 mg film-coated tablets are available. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nMyelosuppression \n\nDose modifications for neutropenia (ANC* < 1.0 x 109/L) and thrombocytopenia \n(platelet < 50 x 109/L) that are unrelated to leukaemia are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1 Dose modifications for myelosuppression \n\nANC* < 1.0 x 109/L \nor \nplatelet < 50 x 109/L \n\nFirst occurrence:  \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be withheld and resumed at the same dose after \n\nrecovery to ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L and platelet \u2265 75 x 109/L \nRecurrence at 45 mg:  \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be withheld and resumed at 30 mg after \n\nrecovery to  \nANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L and platelet \u2265 75 x 109/L \n\nRecurrence at 30 mg:  \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be withheld and resumed at 15 mg after \n\nrecovery to  \nANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L and platelet \u2265 75 x 109/L \n\n*ANC = absolute neutrophil count \n \nArterial occlusion and venous thromboembolism \n\nIn a patient suspected of developing an arterial occlusive event or a venous thromboembolism, Iclusig \nshould be immediately interrupted. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart \nIclusig therapy (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) after the event is resolved. \n \nHypertension may contribute to risk of arterial occlusive events. Iclusig treatment should be \ntemporarily interrupted if hypertension is not medically controlled. \n \nPancreatitis \n\nRecommended modifications for pancreatic adverse reactions are summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 Dose modifications for pancreatitis and elevation of lipase/amylase \nGrade 2 pancreatitis and/or \nasymptomatic elevation of \nlipase/amylase \n\nIclusig should be continued at the same dose \n\nGrade 3 or 4 asymptomatic \nelevation of lipase/amylase \n(> 2.0 x IULN*) only \n\nOccurrence at 45 mg: \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be withheld and resumed at 30 mg after \n\nrecovery to \u2264 Grade 1 (< 1.5 x IULN)  \nOccurrence at 30 mg:  \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be withheld and resumed at 15 mg after \n\nrecovery to \u2264 Grade 1 (< 1.5 x IULN) \nOccurrence at 15 mg: \n\uf0b7 Iclusig discontinuation should be considered \n\nGrade 3 pancreatitis  \n\nOccurrence at 45 mg: \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be withheld and resumed at 30 mg after \n\nrecovery to < Grade 2 \nOccurrence at 30 mg: \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be withheld and resumed at 15 mg after \n\nrecovery to < Grade 2 \nOccurrence at 15 mg: \n\uf0b7 Iclusig discontinuation should be considered \n\nGrade 4 pancreatitis Iclusig should be discontinued \n*IULN = institution upper limit of normal \n \nHepatic toxicity \n\nDose interruption or discontinuation may be required as described in Table 3. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTable 3 Recommended dose modifications for hepatic toxicity \nElevation of liver transaminase \n> 3 \u00d7 ULN* \n \nPersistent grade 2 (longer \nthan 7 days) \n \nGrade 3 or higher \n\nOccurrence at 45 mg: \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be interrupted and hepatic function \n\nshould be monitored \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be resumed at 30 mg after recovery to \n\n\u2264 Grade 1 (< 3 \u00d7 ULN), or recovery  to pre-treatment \ngrade \n\nOccurrence at 30 mg: \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be interrupted and resumed at 15 mg \n\nafter recovery to \u2264 Grade 1, or recovery to pre-\ntreatment grade \n\nOccurrence at 15 mg: \n\uf0b7 Iclusig should be discontinued \n\nElevation of AST or ALT \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN \nconcurrent with an elevation of \nbilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN and alkaline \nphosphatase < 2 \u00d7 ULN \n\nIclusig should be discontinued \n\n*ULN = Upper Limit of Normal for the lab \n \n\nElderly patients \n\nOf the 449 patients in the clinical study of Iclusig, 155 (35%) were \u2265 65 years of age. Compared to \npatients < 65 years, older patients are more likely to experience adverse reactions. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose. Caution is \nrecommended when administering Iclusig to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nRenal excretion is not a major route of ponatinib elimination. Iclusig has not been studied in patients \nwith renal impairment. Patients with estimated creatinine clearance of \u2265 50 mL/min should be able to \nsafely receive Iclusig with no dosage adjustment. Caution is recommended when administering Iclusig \nto patients with estimated creatinine clearance of < 50 mL/min, or end-stage renal disease. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Iclusig in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nIclusig is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole. Patients should not crush or dissolve \nthe tablets. Iclusig may be taken with or without food. \n \nPatients should be advised not to swallow the desiccant canister found in the bottle. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nImportant adverse reactions \n \nMyelosuppression \n\nIclusig is associated with severe (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \nEvents grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. Most of the patients with grade 3 or \n4 platelet count decreased, anaemia or neutropenia, developed it within the first 3 months of treatment. \nThe frequency of these events is greater in patients with accelerated phase CML (AP-CML) or blast \n\n\n\n6 \n\nphase CML (BP-CML)/Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase CML (CP-CML). A complete blood count \nshould be performed every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated. \nMyelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding Iclusig temporarily \nor reducing the dose (see section 4.2). \n \nArterial occlusion \n\nArterial occlusions, including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, retinal arterial occlusions associated \nin some cases with permanent visual impairment or vision loss, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the \nbrain, severe peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis (associated with worsening, labile or \ntreatment-resistant hypertension), and the need for urgent revascularization procedures have occurred \nin Iclusig-treated patients. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age \n50 years or younger, experienced these events. Arterial occlusion adverse events were more frequent \nwith increasing age and in patients with history of ischaemia, hypertension, diabetes, or \nhyperlipidaemia.  \n \nThe risk of arterial occlusive events is likely to be dose-related (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nIn the phase 2 trial (with a minimum of 64 months follow-up), arterial occlusive adverse reactions \nhave occurred in 25% of patients (treatment-emergent frequencies). Some patients experienced more \nthan 1 type of event. Arterial cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular occlusive \nadverse reactions (treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 13%, 9%, and 11% of Iclusig-treated \npatients, respectively.  \n \nIn the phase 2 trial, serious arterial occlusive adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients \n(treatment-emergent frequencies). Serious arterial cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral \nvascular occlusive adverse reactions (treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 10%, 7%, and 9% \nof Iclusig treated patients, respectively (see section 4.8). \n \nThe median time to onset of the first cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular arterial \nocclusive events was 351, 611, and 605 days, respectively. \n \nIclusig should not be used in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, prior revascularization or \nstroke, unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the potential risk (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \nIn these patients, alternative treatment options should also be considered before starting treatment with \nponatinib. \n \nBefore starting treatment with ponatinib, the cardiovascular status of the patient should be assessed, \nincluding history and physical examination, and cardiovascular risk factors should be actively \nmanaged. Cardiovascular status should continue to be monitored and medical and supportive therapy \nfor conditions that contribute to cardiovascular risk should be optimised during treatment with \nponatinib. \n \nMonitoring for evidence of arterial occlusion should be performed and if decreased vision or blurred \nvision occurs, an ophthalmic examination (including fundoscopy) should be performed. Iclusig should \nbe interrupted immediately in case of arterial occlusion. A benefit -risk consideration should guide a \ndecision to restart Iclusig therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nVenous thromboembolism  \n\nIn the phase 2 trial (with a minimum of 64 months follow-up), venous thromboembolic adverse \nreactions have occurred in 6% of patients (treatment-emergent frequencies). Serious venous \nthromboembolic adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients (treatment-emergent frequencies) (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nMonitoring for evidence of thromboembolism should be performed. Iclusig should be interrupted \nimmediately in case of thromboembolism. A benefit -risk consideration should guide a decision to \nrestart Iclusig therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nRetinal venous occlusions associated in some cases with permanent visual impairment or vision loss \nhave occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. If decreased vision or blurred vision occurs, an ophthalmic \nexamination (including fundoscopy) should be performed. \n \n\nHypertension  \n\nHypertension may contribute to risk of arterial thrombotic events, including renal artery stenosis. \nDuring Iclusig treatment, blood pressure should be monitored and managed at each clinic visit and \nhypertension should be treated to normal. Iclusig treatment should be temporarily interrupted if \nhypertension is not medically controlled (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the event of significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, treatment should be \ninterrupted and evaluation for renal artery stenosis should be considered. \n \nTreatment-emergent hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. \nPatients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, \nchest pain, or shortness of breath. \n \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \n\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Iclusig, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n\nFatal and serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in Iclusig-treated patients, \nincluding events related to prior vascular occlusive events. Patients should be monitored for signs or \nsymptoms consistent with heart failure and they should be treated as clinically indicated, including \ninterruption of Iclusig. Discontinuation of ponatinib should be considered in patients who develop \nserious heart failure (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nPancreatitis and serum lipase \n\nIclusig is associated with pancreatitis. The frequency of pancreatitis is greater in the first 2 months of \nuse. Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then periodically thereafter. Dose \ninterruption or reduction may be required. If lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal \nsymptoms, Iclusig should be withheld and patients evaluated for evidence of pancreatitis (see section \n4.2). Caution is recommended in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Patients with \nsevere or very severe hypertriglyceridemia should be appropriately managed to reduce the risk of \npancreatitis. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n\nIclusig may result in elevation in ALT, AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Most patients who \nhad an event of hepatotoxicity had their first event during the first year of treatment. Hepatic failure \n(including fatal outcome) has been observed. Liver function tests should be performed prior to \ntreatment initiation and monitored periodically, as clinically indicated. \n \nHaemorrhage \n\nSevere haemorrhage, including fatalities, occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. The incidence of severe \nbleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML and Ph+ ALL. Gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most commonly reported grade 3/4 bleeding events. \nMost haemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Iclusig \nshould be interrupted and patients evaluated for serious or severe haemorrhage. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these \npatients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or \nfulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Iclusig. Experts in liver \ndisease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients \n\n\n\n8 \n\nwith positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test \npositive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Iclusig \nshould be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and \nfor several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome  \n\nPost-marketing cases of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) have been reported in \nIclusig-treated patients. \nPRES is a neurological disorder that can present with signs and symptoms such as seizure, headache, \ndecreased alertness, altered mental functioning, vision loss, and other visual and neurological \ndisturbances. \nIf diagnosed, interrupt Iclusig treatment and resume treatment only once the event is resolved and if \nthe benefit of continued treatment outweighs the risk of PRES. \n \nMedicinal product interactions \nCaution should be exercised with concurrent use of Iclusig and moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors \nand moderate and strong CYP3A inducers (see section 4.5).  \n \nConcomitant use of ponatinib with anti-clotting agents should be approached with caution in patients \nwho may be at risk of bleeding events (see \u201cMyelosuppression\u201d and \u201cHaemorrhage\u201d). Formal studies \nof ponatinib with anti-clotting medicinal products have not been conducted. \n \nQT prolongation \nThe QT interval prolongation potential of Iclusig was assessed in 39 leukaemia patients and no \nclinically significant QT prolongation was observed (see section 5.1). However, a thorough QT study \nhas not been performed; therefore a clinically significant effect on QT cannot be excluded. \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose. Caution is \nrecommended when administering Iclusig to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nCaution is recommended in when administering Iclusig to patients with estimated creatinine clearance \nof < 50 mL/min or end-stage renal disease (see section 4.2). \n \nLactose \nThis medicinal product contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take \nthis medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSubstances that may increase ponatinib serum concentrations \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \n\nPonatinib is metabolized by CYP3A4.  \nCo-administration of a single 15 mg oral dose of Iclusig in the presence of ketoconazole (400 mg \ndaily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in modest increases in ponatinib systemic exposure, with \nponatinib AUC0-\u221e and Cmax values that were 78% and 47% higher, respectively, than those seen when \nponatinib was administered alone.  \n \nCaution should be exercised and a reduction of the starting dose of Iclusig to 30 mg should be \nconsidered with concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors such as clarithromycin, indinavir, \n\n\n\n9 \n\nitraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, \ntroleandomycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit juice. \n \nSubstances that may decrease ponatinib serum concentrations \n \nCYP3A inducers \n\nCo-administration of a single 45 mg dose of Iclusig in the presence of rifampin (600 mg daily), a \nstrong CYP3A inducer, to 19 healthy volunteers, decreased the AUC0-\u221e and Cmax of ponatinib by 62% \nand 42%, respectively, when compared to administration of ponatinib alone. \n \nCo-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \nrifabutin, rifampicin, and St. John\u2019s Wort with ponatinib should be avoided, and alternatives to the \nCYP3A4 inducer should be sought, unless the benefit outweighs the possible risk of ponatinib \nunderexposure. \n \nSubstances that may have their serum concentrations altered by ponatinib  \n \nTransporter substrates \n\nIn vitro, ponatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Therefore, ponatinib may have the potential to \nincrease plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, \ncolchicine, pravastatin) or BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) and may increase \ntheir therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Close clinical surveillance is recommended when \nponatinib is administered with these medicinal products.  \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females  \nWomen of childbearing age being treated with Iclusig should be advised not to become pregnant and \nmen being treated with Iclusig should be advised not to father a child during treatment. An effective \nmethod of contraception should be used during treatment. It is unknown whether ponatinib affects the \neffectiveness of systemic hormonal contraceptives. An alternative or additional method of \ncontraception should be used.  \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Iclusig in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Iclusig should be \nused during pregnancy only when clearly necessary. If it is used during pregnancy, the patient must be \ninformed of the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether Iclusig is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic and \ntoxicological data cannot exclude potential excretion in human milk. Breast-feeding should be stopped \nduring treatment with Iclusig. \n \nFertility \nNo human data on the effect of ponatinib on fertility are available. In rats, treatment with ponatinib \nhas shown effects on female fertility and male fertility was not affected (see section 5.3). The clinical \nrelevance of these findings to human fertility is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIclusig has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such as \nlethargy, dizziness, and vision blurred have been associated with Iclusig. Therefore, caution should be \nrecommended when driving or operating machines. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe adverse reactions described in this section were identified in a single-arm, open-label, \ninternational, multicenter trial in 449 CML and Ph+ ALL patients who were resistant or intolerant to \nprior TKI therapy including those with a BCR-ABL T315I mutation. All patients received 45 mg \nIclusig once daily. Dose adjustments to 30 mg once daily or 15 mg once daily were allowed for the \nmanagement of treatment toxicity. Additionally, after approximately 2 years of follow-up, all patients \nwho were still taking a 45 mg daily dose were recommended to undergo a dose reduction, even in the \nabsence of adverse events, in response to the continued occurrence of vascular occlusive events in the \nclinical trial. At the time of reporting, all ongoing patients had a minimum follow-up of 64 months. \nThe median duration of treatment with Iclusig was 32.2 months in CP-CML patients, 19.4 months in \nAP-CML patients, and 2.9 months in BP-CML/Ph+ ALL patients. The median dose intensity was \n28 mg/day in CP-CML patients or, 63% of the expected 45 mg dose; median dose intensity was \ngreater in advanced disease states (32 mg/day in the AP-CML patients and 44 mg/day in the BP \nCML/Ph+ ALL patients).  \n \nThe most common serious adverse reactions >2% (treatment-emergent frequencies) were pneumonia \n(7.3%), pancreatitis (5.8%), abdominal pain (4.7%), atrial fibrillation (4.5%), pyrexia (4.5%), \nmyocardial infarction (4.0%), peripheral arterial occlusive disease (3.8%), anaemia (3.8%), angina \npectoris (3.3%), platelet count decreased (3.1%), febrile neutropenia (2.9%), hypertension (2.9%), \ncoronary artery disease (2.7%), cardiac failure congestive (2.4%), cerebrovascular accident (2.4%), \nsepsis (2.4%), cellulitis (2.2%), acute kidney injury (2.0%), urinary tract infection (2.0%) and lipase \nincreased (2.0%). \n \nSerious arterial cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular occlusive adverse reactions \n(treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 10%, 7%, and 9% of Iclusig treated patients, \nrespectively. Serious venous occlusive reactions (treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 5% of \npatients.  \n \nArterial cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular occlusive adverse reactions \n(treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 13%, 9%, and 11% of Iclusig-treated patients, \nrespectively. Overall arterial occlusive adverse reactions have occurred in 25% of Iclusig-treated \npatients from the phase 2 trial, with serious adverse reactions occurring in 20% of patients. Some \npatients experienced more than one type of event. \n \nVenous thromboembolic reactions (treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 6% of patients. The \nincidence of thromboembolic events is higher in patients with Ph+ ALL or BP-CML than those with \nAP-CML or CP-CML.

Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIsolated reports of unintentional overdose with Iclusig were reported in clinical trials. Single doses of \n165 mg and an estimated 540 mg in two patients did not result in any clinically significant adverse \nreactions. Multiple doses of 90 mg per day for 12 days in a patient resulted in pneumonia, systemic \ninflammatory response, atrial fibrillation, and asymptomatic, moderate pericardial effusion. Treatment \nwas interrupted, the events resolved, and Iclusig was restarted at 45 mg, once daily. In the event of an \noverdose of Iclusig, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE24 \n \nPonatinib is a potent pan BCR-ABL inhibitor with structural elements, including a carbon-carbon \ntriple-bond, that enable high affinity binding to native BCR-ABL and mutant forms of the ABL \nkinase. Ponatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and T315I mutant ABL with IC50 values \nof 0.4 and 2.0 nM, respectively. In cellular assays, ponatinib was able to overcome imatinib, dasatinib, \nand nilotinib resistance mediated by BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. In preclinical mutagenesis \nstudies, 40 nM was determined as the concentration of ponatinib sufficient to inhibit viability of cells \nexpressing all tested BCR-ABL mutants by > 50% (including T315I) and suppress the emergence of \nmutant clones. In a cell-based accelerated mutagenesis assay, no mutation in BCR-ABL was detected \nthat could confer resistance to 40 nM ponatinib.  \nPonatinib elicited tumour shrinkage and prolonged survival in mice bearing tumours expressing native \nor T315I mutant BCR-ABL.  \nAt doses of 30 mg or greater plasma steady state trough concentrations of ponatinib typically exceed \n21 ng/mL (40 nM). At doses of 15 mg or greater, 32 of 34 patients (94%) demonstrated a \u2265 50% \nreduction of CRK-like (CRKL) phosphorylation, a biomarker of BCR-ABL inhibition, in peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells.  \nPonatinib inhibits the activity of other clinically relevant kinases with IC50 values below 20 nM and \nhas demonstrated cellular activity against RET, FLT3, and KIT and members of the FGFR, PDGFR, \nand VEGFR families of kinases.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and efficacy of Iclusig in CML and Ph+ ALL patients who were resistant or intolerant to \nprior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy were evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, international, \nmulticenter trial. All patients were administered 45 mg of Iclusig once-daily with the possibility of \ndose de-escalations and dose interruptions followed by dose resumption and re-escalation. Patients \nwere assigned to one of six cohorts based on disease phase (CP-CML; AP-CML; or BP-\nCML/Ph+ ALL), resistance or intolerance (R/I) to dasatinib or nilotinib, and the presence of the T315I \nmutation. The trial is ongoing. \n \nResistance in CP-CML was defined as failure to achieve either a complete haematological response \n(by 3 months), a minor cytogenetic response (by 6 months), or a major cytogenetic response (by \n12 months) while on dasatinib or nilotinib. CP-CML patients who experienced a loss of response or \ndevelopment of a kinase domain mutation in the absence of a complete cytogenetic response or \nprogression to AP-CML or BP-CML at any time on dasatinib or nilotinib were also considered \nresistant. Resistance in AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL was defined as failure to achieve either a \nmajor haematological response (AP-CML by 3 months, BP-CML/Ph+ ALL by 1 month), loss of major \nhaematological response (at any time), or development of kinase domain mutation in the absence of a \nmajor haematological response while on dasatinib or nilotinib.  \n \nIntolerance was defined as the discontinuation of dasatinib or nilotinib due to toxicities despite optimal \nmanagement in the absence of a complete cytogenetic response for CP CML patients or major \nhaematological response for AP CML, BP CML, or Ph+ ALL patients. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in CP-CML was major cytogenetic response (MCyR), which included \ncomplete and partial cytogenetic responses (CCyR and PCyR). The secondary efficacy endpoints in \nCP-CML were complete haematological response (CHR) and major molecular response (MMR). \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL was major haematological \nresponse (MaHR), defined as either a complete haematological response (CHR) or no evidence of \nleukaemia (NEL). The secondary efficacy endpoints in AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL were MCyR \nand MMR. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nFor all patients, additional secondary efficacy endpoints included: confirmed MCyR, time to response, \nduration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival. Also, post-hoc analyses to assess \nthe relationship of shorter-term cytogenetic (MCyR) and molecular (MMR) response outcomes with \nlonger-term outcomes of PFS and OS, maintenance of response (MCyR and MMR) after dose \nreductions, and PFS and OS by Arterial Occlusive Event status were conducted. \n \nThe trial enrolled 449 patients of which 444 were eligible for analysis: 267 CP-CML patients (R/I \nCohort: n=203, T315I Cohort: n=64), 83 AP-CML patients (R/I Cohort: n=65, T315I Cohort: n=18), \n62 BP-CML (R/I Cohort: n=38, T315I Cohort: n=24), and 32 Ph+ ALL patients (R/I Cohort: n=10, \nT315I Cohort: n=22). A prior MCyR or better (MCyR, MMR, or CMR) to dasatinib or nilotinib was \nonly achieved in 26% patients with CP-CML and a prior MaHR or better (MaHR, MCyR, MMR, or \nCMR) was only achieved in 21%, and 24% of AP-CML, and BP-CML/Ph+ALL patients, respectively. \nBaseline demographic characteristics are described in Table 6 below. \n \nTable 6 Demographics and disease characteristics \n\nPatient characteristics at entry Total safety population N=449 \nAge \n\nMedian, years (range) 59 (18 - 94) \nGender, n (%) \n\nMale 238 (53%) \nRace, n (%) \n\nAsian 59 (13%) \nBlack/African American 25 (6%) \nWhite 352 (78%) \nOther 13 (3%) \n\nECOG Performance Status, n (%) \nECOG=0 or 1 414 (92%) \n\nDisease history \nMedian time from diagnosis to first dose, years (range) 6.09 (0.33 - 28.47) \n\n  Resistant to Prior TKI Therapy a *, n (%) 374 (88%) \n  Prior TKI therapy\u2013 number of regimens, n (%)  \n     1 32 (7%) \n     2 155 (35%) \n     \u2265 3 262 (58%) \n  BCR-ABL mutation detected at entry, n (%)b  \n     None 198 (44%) \n     1 192 (43%) \n     \u2265 2 54 (12%) \na* of 427 patients reporting prior TKI therapy with dasatinib or nilotinib \nb Of the patients with one or more BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations detected at entry, 37 unique \nmutations were  detected. \n \nOverall, 55% of patients had one or more BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation at entry with the most \nfrequent being: T315I (29%), F317L (8%), E255K (4%) and E359V (4%).

Defined as a \u2264 0.1% ratio of BCR-ABL to ABL transcripts on the \nInternational Scale (IS) (ie, \u2264 0.1% BCR-ABLIS; patients must have the b2a2/b3a2 (p210) transcript), \nin peripheral blood measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT \nPCR). \nDatabase cutoff date 06 February 2017. \n \nCP-CML patients who received fewer prior TKIs attained higher cytogenetic, haematological, and \nmolecular responses. Of the CP-CML patients previously treated with one, two, three or four prior \nTKIs, 75% (12/16), 68% (66/97), 44% (63/142), and 58% (7/12)) achieved a MCyR while on Iclusig, \nrespectively. \n \nOf the CP-CML patients with no mutation detected at entry, 49% (66/136) achieved a MCyR. \n \nFor every BCR-ABL mutation detected in more than one CP-CML patient at entry, a MCyR was \nachieved following treatment with Iclusig. \n \nIn CP-CML patients who achieved MCyR, the median time to MCyR was 2.8 months (range: 1.6 to \n11.3 months) and in patients who achieved MMR, the median time to MMR was 5.5 months (range: \n1.8 to 55.5 months). At the time of updated reporting with minimum follow-up for all ongoing patients \nof 64 months, the median durations of MCyR and MMR had not yet been reached. Based on the \nKaplan-Meier estimates, 82% (95% CI: [74%\u201388%]) of CP-CML (median duration of treatment: \n32.2 months) patients who achieved a MCyR are projected to maintain that response at 48 months and \n61% (95% CI: [51%- 70%]) of CP-CML patients who achieved a MMR are projected to maintain that \nresponse at 36 months. The probability of all patients with CP CML maintaining MCyR and MMR did \nnot change further when the analysis was extended out to 5 years. \n \nWith a minimum follow-up of 64 months, 3.4% (9/267) of CP-CML patients experienced \ntransformation of their disease to AP-CML or BP-CML. \n \nFor CP-CML patients overall (N=267), as well as for CP-CML R/I Cohort A patients (N=203) \nand T315I Cohort B patients (N=64), the median OS has not yet been reached. For the overall \nCP-CML disease group, the probability of survival at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years is estimated \nas 86.0%, 81.2%, 76.9%, and 73.3%, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nFigure 1- Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall survival in the CP-CML population (Treated Population) \n \n\n \n \nCP -CML patients who achieved MCyR or MMR response within the first year of treatment had \nstatistically significantly improved progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to \nthose patients who did not meet the treatment milestones. A MCyR at the 3-month landmark \ncorrelated strongly and statistically significantly with PFS and OS (p<0.0001 and p=0.0006, \nrespectively).

At the time of updated reporting with minimum follow-up for all ongoing patients of \n64  months, the median duration of MaHR for AP-CML (median duration of treatment: 19.4 months) \nBP-CML (median duration of treatment: 2.9 months), and Ph+ ALL (median duration of treatment: \n2.7 months) patients was estimated as 12.9 months (range: 1.2 to 68.4 months), 6.0 months (range: \n1.8 to 59.6 months), and 3.2 months (range: 1.8 to 12.8 months), respectively. \n \nFor all patients in the phase 2 trial, the dose intensity-safety relationship indicated that there are \nsignificant increases in grade \u2265 3 adverse events (cardiac failure, arterial thrombosis, hypertension, \nthrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, neutropenia, rash, ALT increase, AST increase, lipase increase, \nmyelosuppression, arthralgia) over the dose range of 15 to 45 mg once-daily.  \n \nThe analysis of the dose intensity-safety relationship in the phase 2 trial concluded that after adjusting \nfor covariates, the overall dose intensity is significantly associated with an increased risk of vascular \nocclusion, with an odds ratio of approximately 1.6 for each 15 mg increase. In addition, results from \nlogistic regression analyses of data from patients in the phase 1 trial, suggest a relationship between \nsystemic exposure (AUC) and occurrence of arterial thrombotic events. A reduction in dose is \ntherefore expected to reduce the risk of vascular occlusive events, however, the analysis suggested that \nthere may be a \u2018carry over\u2019 effect of higher doses such that it might take up to several months before a \ndose reduction manifests in risk reduction. Other covariates that show a statistically significant \nassociation with the occurrence of vascular occlusive events in this analysis are medical history of \nischemia and age. \n \nDose reduction in CP-CML patients \n \nIn the phase 2 trial, dose reductions were recommended following adverse events; in addition in \nOctober 2013 new recommendations for prospective dose reduction in all CP-CML patients in the \nabsence of adverse events were introduced in this trial with the aim of reducing the risk of vascular \nocclusive events.  \nWith a minimum follow-up of 48 months, and approximately 2 years after the recommendation for \nprospective dose reduction, there were 110 CP-CML patients ongoing. A majority of these ongoing \npatients (82/110 patients; 75%) were reported to be receiving 15 mg at the last dose, while \n24/110 patients (22%) were receiving 30 mg, and 4/110 (4%) were receiving 45 mg. At the time of \nstudy closure initiation (minimum follow-up of 64 months, and more than 3 years after the \nrecommendation for prospective dose reduction), 99 CP-CML patients were ongoing and 77 (78%) of \nthese patients received 15 mg as their last dose on study. \n \nSafety \n\nIn the phase 2 trial, 86 CP-CML patients achieved MCyR at a dose of 45 mg, 45 CP-CML patients \nachieved MCyR after a dose reduction to 30 mg, mostly for adverse events.  \nVascular occlusive events occurred in 44 of these 131 patients. Most of these events occurred at the \ndose at which the patient achieved MCyR; fewer events occurred after dose reduction. \n \nTable 10 Vascular occlusive first adverse events in CP-CML patients who achieved MCyR at \n\n45 mg or 30 mg (data extraction 7 April 2014) \n Most recent dose at onset of first vascular occlusive Event \n\n45 mg 30 mg 15 mg \nAchieved MCyR at 45 mg  \n(N=86) 19 6 0 \n\nAchieved MCyR at 30 mg  \n(N=45) 1 13 5 \n\n \nThe median time to onset of the first cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular arterial \nocclusive events was 351, 611, and 605 days, respectively.  When adjusted for exposure, the incidence \nof first arterial occlusive events was greatest in the first two years of follow-up and declined with \ndecreasing daily dose intensity (following recommendation for prospective dose reduction). Factors \nother than dose may also contribute to this risk of arterial occlusion. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nEfficacy \n\nData from the phase 2 trial are available on the maintenance of response (MCyR and MMR) in all CP-\nCML patients who underwent dose reduction for any reason. Table 11 shows these data for patients \nwho achieved MCyR and MMR at 45 mg; similar data are available for patients who achieved MCyR \nand MMR at 30 mg.  \nThe majority of patients who underwent dose reduction maintained response (MCyR and MMR) for \nthe duration of currently available follow-up. A proportion of patients did not undergo any dose \nreduction, based on an individual benefit-risk assessment. \n \nTable 11 Maintenance of response in CP-CML patients who achieved MCyR or MMR at \n\n45 mg dose (data extraction 6 February 2017) \n Achieved MCyR  \n\nat 45 mg (N=86) \nAchieved MMR \nat 45 mg (N=63) \n\n Number of \npatients \n\nMaintained \nMCyR \n\nNumber of \npatients \n\nMaintained \nMMR \n\nNo dose reduction 19 13 (68%) 18 11 (61%) \nDose reduction to 30 mg only  15 13  (87%) 5 3  (60%) \n     \u2265 3 month reduction at 30 mg 12 10  (83%) 3 2  (67%) \n     \u2265 6 month reduction at 30 mg 11 9  (82%) 3 2  (67%) \n     \u2265 12 month reduction at 30 mg 8 7 (88%) 3 2  (67%) \n \u2265 18 month reduction at 30 mg 7 6 (86%) 2 2 (100%) \n \u2265 24 month reduction at 30 mg 6 6 (100%) 2 2 (100%) \n \u2265 36 month reduction at 30 mg 1 1 (100%) -- -- \nAny dose reduction to 15 mg 52 51  (98%) 40 36  (90%) \n     \u2265 3 month reduction at 15 mg 49 49  (100%) 39 36  (92%) \n     \u2265 6 month reduction at 15 mg 47 47  (100%) 37 35  (95%) \n     \u2265 12 month reduction at 15 mg 44 44  (100%) 34 33 (97%) \n\n\u2265 18 month day reduction at \n15 mg 38 38 (100%) 29 29 (100%) \n\n\u2265 24 month reduction at 15 mg 32 32 (100%) 23 23 (100%) \n\u2265 36 month reduction at 15 mg 8 8 (100%) 4 4 (100%) \n\n \nThe anti-leukaemic activity of Iclusig was also evaluated in a phase 1 dose escalation study that \nincluded 65 CML and Ph+ ALL patients; the study is completed. Of 43 CP-CML patients, 31 \nCP-CML patients achieved a MCyR with a median duration of follow-up of 55.5 months (range: 1.7 to \n91.4 months). At the time of reporting, 25 CP-CML patients were in MCyR (median duration of \nMCyR had not been reached). \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nThe QT interval prolongation potential of Iclusig was assessed in 39 leukaemia patients who received \n30 mg, 45 mg, or 60 mg Iclusig once daily. Serial ECGs in triplicate were collected at baseline and at \nsteady state to evaluate the effect of ponatinib on QT intervals. No clinically significant changes in the \nmean QTc interval (i.e., > 20 ms) from baseline were detected in the study. In addition, the \npharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models show no exposure-effect relationship, with an estimated \nQTcF mean change of \u20136.4 ms (upper confidence interval \u20130.9 ms) at Cmax for the 60 mg group.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIclusig in children from birth to less than 1 year in CML and Ph+ ALL. The European Medicines \nAgency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Iclusig in paediatric patients \nfrom 1 year to less than 18 years in CML and Ph+ ALL (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nPeak concentrations of ponatinib are observed approximately 4 hours after oral administration. Within \nthe range of clinically relevant doses evaluated in patients (15 mg to 60 mg), ponatinib exhibited dose \nproportional increases in both Cmax and AUC. The geometric mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC(0-\u03c4) \nexposures achieved for ponatinib 45 mg daily at steady state were 77 ng/mL (50%) and \n1296 ng\u2022hr/mL (48%), respectively. Following either a high-fat and low-fat meal, plasma ponatinib \nexposures (Cmax and AUC) were not different versus fasting conditions. Iclusig may be administered \nwith or without food. Co-administration of Iclusig with a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion \nresulted in a minor reduction in ponatinib Cmax without a reduction in AUC0-\u221e. \n \nDistribution \nPonatinib is highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins in vitro. The blood/plasma ratio of ponatinib is \n0.96. Ponatinib is not displaced by concomitant administration of ibuprofen, nifedipine, propranolol, \nsalicylic acid, or warfarin. At daily doses of 45 mg, the geometric mean (CV%) apparent steady state \nvolume of distribution is 1101 L (94%) suggesting that ponatinib is extensively distributed in the \nextravascular space. In vitro studies suggested that ponatinib is either not a substrate or is a weak \nsubstrate for both P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein BCRP. Ponatinib is not a substrate for the \nhuman organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and the organic cation \ntransporter OCT-1. \n \nBiotransformation \nPonatinib is metabolized to an inactive carboxylic acid by esterases and/or amidases, and metabolized \nby CYP3A4 to an N-desmethyl metabolite that is 4 times less active than ponatinib. The carboxylic \nacid and the N-desmethyl metabolite comprise 58% and 2% of the circulating levels of ponatinib, \nrespectively. \n \nAt therapeutic serum concentrations, ponatinib did not inhibit OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, OCT1 or \nOCT2, organic anion transporters OAT1 or OAT3, or bile salt export pump (BSEP) in vitro. \nTherefore, clinical medicinal product interactions are unlikely to occur as a result of  \nponatinib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these transporters. In vitro studies indicate that clinical \nmedicinal product interactions are unlikely to occur as a result of ponatinib-mediated inhibition of the \nmetabolism of substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A or CYP2D6.  \n \nAn in vitro study in human hepatocytes indicated that clinical medicinal product interactions are also \nunlikely to occur as a result of ponatinib-mediated induction of the metabolism of substrates for \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. \n \nElimination \nFollowing single and multiple 45 mg doses of Iclusig, the terminal elimination half-life of ponatinib \nwas 22 hours, and steady state conditions are typically achieved within 1 week of continuous dosing. \nWith once-daily dosing, plasma exposures of ponatinib are increased by approximately 1.5-fold \nbetween first dose and steady state conditions. Although plasma ponatinib exposures increased to \nsteady-state levels with continuous dosing, a population pharmacokinetic analysis predicts a limited \nincrease in apparent oral clearance within the first two weeks of continuous dosing, which is not \nconsidered clinically relevant. Ponatinib is mainly eliminated via faeces. Following a single oral dose \nof [14C]-labeled ponatinib, approximately 87% of the radioactive dose is recovered in the faeces and \napproximately 5% in the urine. Unchanged ponatinib accounted for 24% and < 1% of the administered \ndose in faeces and urine, respectively, with the remainder of the dose comprising metabolites. \n \nRenal impairment  \nIclusig has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Although renal excretion is not a major \nroute of ponatinib elimination, the potential for moderate or severe renal impairment to affect hepatic \nelimination has not been determined (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nHepatic impairment  \nA single dose of 30 mg ponatinib was administered to patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic \nimpairment and to healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. Ponatinib Cmax was comparable in \npatients with mild hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. In patients \nwith moderate or severe hepatic impairment, ponatinib Cmax and AUC0-\u221e were lower and ponatinib \nplasma elimination half-life was longer in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment \nbut not clinically significantly different than in healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. \n \nIn vitro data showed no difference in plasma protein binding in plasma samples of healthy subjects \nand hepatically impaired (mild, moderate and severe) subjects. Compared to healthy volunteers with \nnormal liver function, no major differences in ponatinib PK were observed in patients with varying \ndegrees of hepatic impairment. A reduction of the starting dose of Iclusig in patients with hepatic \nimpairment is not necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCaution is recommended when administering Iclusig to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections \n4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nIclusig has not been studied at doses above 30 mg in patients with hepatic impairment (Childs-Pugh \nClasses A, B & C). \n \nIntrinsic factors affecting ponatinib pharmacokinetics \nNo specific studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of gender, age, race, and body weight \non ponatinib pharmacokinetics. An integrated population pharmacokinetic analysis completed for \nponatinib suggests that age may be predictive of variability for ponatinib apparent oral clearance \n(CL/F). Gender, race and body weight were not predictive in explaining ponatinib pharmacokinetic \nintersubject variability. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIclusig has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive \ntoxicity, phototoxicity and carcinogenicity studies. \n \nPonatinib did not exhibit genotoxic properties when evaluated in the standard in vitro and in vivo \nsystems. \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use are described below. \n \nDepletion of lymphoid organs was observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus \nmonkeys. The effects were shown to be reversible after withdrawal of the treatment.  \n \nHyper-/hypoplastic changes of the chondrocytes in the physis were noted in repeat-dose toxicity \nstudies in rats. \n \nIn rats, inflammatory changes accompanied by increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and \nfibrinogen levels were found in the preputial and clitoral glands following chronic dosing.  \n \nSkin changes in the form of crusts, hyperkeratosis, or erythema were observed in toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys. Dry flaky skin was observed in toxicity studies in rats. \n \nIn a study in rats, diffuse corneal edema with neutrophilic cell infiltration, and hyperplastic changes in \nthe lenticular epithelium suggestive of a mild phototoxic reaction were observed in animals treated \nwith 5 and 10 mg/kg ponatinib.  \n \nIn cynomolgus monkeys, systolic heart murmurs with no macroscopic or microscopic correlates were \nnoted in individual animals treated with 5 and 45 mg/kg in the single dose toxicity study and at 1, 2.5 \n\n\n\n23 \n\nand 5 mg/kg in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study. The clinical relevance of this finding is \nunknown.  \n \nIn cynomolgus monkeys, thyroid gland follicular atrophy mostly accompanied by a reduction in T3 \nlevels and a tendency toward increased TSH levels were observed in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity \nstudy in cynomolgus monkeys.  \n \nPonatinib-related microscopic findings in the ovaries (increased follicular atresia) and testes (minimal \ngerm cell degeneration) in animals treated with 5 mg/kg ponatinib were noted in repeat-dose toxicity \nstudies in cynomolgus monkeys. \n \nPonatinib at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg produced increases in urine output and electrolyte excretions \nand caused a decrease in gastric emptying in safety pharmacology studies in rats. \n \nIn rats, embryo-foetal toxicity in the form of post-implantation loss, reduced foetal body weight, and \nmultiple soft tissue and skeletal alterations were observed at maternal toxic dosages. Multiple foetal \nsoft tissue and skeletal alterations were also observed at maternal nontoxic dosages.  \n \nIn a fertility study in male and female rats, female fertility parameters were reduced at dose levels \ncorresponding to human clinical exposures. Evidence for pre- and post-implantation loss of embryos \nwas reported in female rats and ponatinib may therefore impair female fertility. There were no effects \non male rat fertility parameters. The clinical relevance of these findings on human fertility is \nunknown. \n \nIn juvenile rats, mortality related to inflammatory effects was observed in animals treated with \n3 mg/kg/day, and reductions in body weight gain were observed at doses of 0.75, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg/day \nduring the pre-weaning and early post-weaning treatment phases. Ponatinib did not adversely affect \nimportant developmental parameters in the juvenile toxicity study. \n \nIn a two-year carcinogenicity study in male and female rats, oral administration of ponatinib at 0.05, \n0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day in males and at 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg/day in females did not result in any \ntumorigenic effects. The 0.8 mg/kg/day dose in females resulted in a plasma exposure level generally \nlower or equivalent to the human exposure at the range of dose from 15 mg to 45 mg daily. A \nstatistically significant increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the clitoral gland was \nobserved at that dose. The clinical relevance of this finding for humans is not known. \n \n \n6.

What Iclusig is and what it is used for \n \nIclusig is used to treat adults with the following leukaemia types who are no longer benefiting from \ntreatment with other medicines, or have a certain genetic difference known as a T315I mutation: \n\uf0b7 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML): a blood cancer involving too many abnormal white blood \n\ncells in the blood and the bone marrow (where blood cells are formed). \n\uf0b7 Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL): a type of \n\nleukaemia involving too many immature white blood cells in the blood and blood forming bone \nmarrow. In this kind of leukaemia, some of the DNA (genetic material) has become rearranged \nto form an abnormal chromosome, the Philadelphia chromosome. \n\n \nIclusig belongs to a group of medicines called tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In patients with CML and \nPh+ ALL, changes in the DNA trigger a signal that tells the body to produce abnormal white blood \ncells. Iclusig blocks this signal, thereby stopping the production of these cells. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Iclusig \n \nDo not take Iclusig \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to ponatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Iclusig if you have: \n\uf0b7 a liver or pancreas disorder or reduced kidney function. Your doctor may want to take additional \n\nprecautions. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\uf0b7 a history of alcohol abuse \n\uf0b7 had a prior heart attack or stroke \n\uf0b7 a history of blood clots in your blood vessels \n\uf0b7 a history of renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys) \n\uf0b7 heart problems, including heart failure, irregular heartbeats, and QT prolongation \n\uf0b7 high blood pressure \n\uf0b7 or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear in a \n\nblood vessel wall \n\uf0b7 a history of bleeding issues \n\uf0b7 ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Iclusig could cause hepatitis \n\nB to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be carefully checked \nby their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n \nYour doctor will perform: \n\uf0b7 evaluations of your heart function and the condition of your arteries and veins \n\uf0b7 a complete blood count \n\nThis will be repeated every 2 weeks for the first 3 months after starting the therapy. Afterwards \nit is performed monthly or as indicated by the doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 checks of the serum protein known as lipase \nA serum protein called lipase will be checked every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then \nperiodically. A break in treatment or a decrease in dose may be required when lipase is \nincreased. \n\n\uf0b7 liver tests \nLiver function tests will be performed periodically, as indicated by your doctor. \n \n\nA brain condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in \npatients treated with ponatinib. Symptoms may include sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, \nseizures, and vision changes. Tell your doctor straight away if you experience any of these symptoms \nduring your treatment with ponatinib, because it could be serious. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children under 18 years because no data are available in children. \n \nOther medicines and Iclusig \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThe following medicines can affect or be affected by Iclusig: \n\uf0b7 ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole: medicines to treat fungal infections. \n\uf0b7 indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir: medicines to treat HIV infection. \n\uf0b7 clarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin: medicines to treat bacterial infections. \n\uf0b7 nefazodone: a medicine to treat depression. \n\uf0b7 St. John\u2019s wort: a herbal product used to treat depression.  \n\uf0b7 carbamazepine: a medicine to treat epilepsy, euphoric/depressive stages and certain pain \n\nconditions. \n\uf0b7 phenobarbital, phenytoin: medicines to treat epilepsy. \n\uf0b7 rifabutin, rifampicin: medicines to treat tuberculosis or certain other infections. \n\uf0b7 digoxin: a medicine to treat heart weakness. \n\uf0b7 dabigatran: a medicine to prevent the formation of blood clots. \n\uf0b7 colchicine: a medicine to treat gout attacks. \n\uf0b7 pravastatin, rosuvastatin: medicines to lower elevated cholesterol levels. \n\uf0b7 methotrexate: a medicine to treat severe joint inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis), cancer and \n\nthe skin disease psoriasis. \n\uf0b7 sulfasalazine: a medicine to treat severe bowel and rheumatic joint inflammation. \n \nIclusig with food and drink \nAvoid grapefruit products such as grapefruit juice. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \n\uf0b7 Contraceptive advice for men and women \n\nWomen of childbearing age being treated with Iclusig should avoid becoming pregnant.
