NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRituzena 100 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 100 mg of rituximab. \n \nEach mL of concentrate contains 10mg of rituximab. \n \nRituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody representing a \nglycosylated immunoglobulin with human IgG1 constant regions and murine light-chain and \nheavy-chain variable region sequences. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster \novary) cell suspension culture and purified by affinity chromatography and ion exchange, including \nspecific viral inactivation and removal procedures. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion.  \nClear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRituzena is indicated in adults for the following indications:  \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) \n \nRituzena is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular \nlymphoma in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nRituzena monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma \nwho are chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. \n \nRituzena is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \nprednisolone) chemotherapy. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) \n \nRituzena in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously \nuntreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. Only limited data are available on efficacy and safety for \npatients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including Rituzena or patients refractory to \nprevious Rituzena plus chemotherapy. \n \nSee section 5.1 for further information. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3  \n\n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nRituzena, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in adult \npatients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic \npolyangiitis (MPA). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRituzena should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of Rituzena. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL, premedication with glucocorticoids should be \nconsidered if Rituzena is not given in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy. \n \nIn patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) or microscopic polyangiitis, \nmethylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a dose of 1000 mg per day is \nrecommended prior to the first infusion of Rituzena (the last dose of methylprednisolone may be \ngiven on the same day as the first infusion of Rituzena). This should be followed by oral prednisone \n1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as possible based on clinical need) \nduring and after Rituzena treatment. \n \nPosology \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nCombination therapy \nThe recommended dose of Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of \npreviously untreated or relapsed/ refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m2 body \nsurface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. \nRituzena should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous \nadministration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. \n\n \n \nMonotherapy \n\n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Rituzena monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with \nstage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse \nafter chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once \nweekly for four weeks. \n \nFor retreatment with Rituzena monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment \nwith Rituzena monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks \n(see section 5.1). \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nRituzena should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dosage is \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle for 8 cycles after \nintravenous infusion of the glucocorticoid component of CHOP.

When Rituzena is given in combination with \nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \napplied. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nProphylaxis with adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics starting 48 hours prior to \nstart of therapy is recommended for CLL patients to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. For \nCLL patients whose lymphocyte counts are > 25 x 109/L it is recommended to administer \nprednisone/prednisolone 100 mg intravenous shortly before infusion with Rituzena to decrease the \nrate and severity of acute infusion reactions and/or cytokine release syndrome. \n \nThe recommended dosage of Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated \nand relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first \ntreatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each \nsubsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total. The chemotherapy should be given after Rituzena infusion. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nPatients treated with Rituzena must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nThe recommended dosage of Rituzena for induction of remission therapy of granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an \nintravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (four infusions in total). \n \nPneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for patients with \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis during and following Rituzena \ntreatment, as appropriate. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged >65 years). \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Rituzena in children below 18 years has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe prepared Rituzena solution should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a \ndedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). \nPatients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or \nhypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \nshould then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory \ntests and, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be \nrestarted until complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest \nX-ray findings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the \nprevious rate. If the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the \ntreatment should be seriously considered on a case by case basis. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5  \n\n \nMild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (section 4.8) usually respond to a \nreduction in the rate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of \nsymptoms. \n \nFirst infusion \n \nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated \nin 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nSubsequent infusions \n \nAll indications \n \nSubsequent doses of Rituzena can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by \n100 mg/h increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nContraindications for use in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nContraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic \npolyangiitis \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nSevere heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease \n(see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n \nAll patients treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and \nmicroscopic polyangiitis must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. The alert card \ncontains important safety information for patients regarding potential increased risk of infections, \nincluding PML. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following the use of rituximab. Patients must be \nmonitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be \nsuggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been \nexcluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6  \n\nneurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. \nConsultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. \n \nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered. \n \nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \npatient is not aware of. \n \nIf a patient develops PML the dosing of rituximab must be permanently discontinued.  \n \nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML \nand suspension of rituximab therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nInfusion related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines \nand/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable \nfrom acute hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and \nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. \n \nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use \nof the rituximab intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \nstarting the first rituximab intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and \nin some cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to \nfever, chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by \nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or \noedema, visible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours \nof initiating the first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with \npulmonary tumour infiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with \nincreased caution. Patients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion \ninterrupted immediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. \nSince initial improvement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients \nshould be closely monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been \nresolved or ruled out. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms \nhas rarely resulted in repeated severe cytokine release syndrome. \n \nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (≥25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant \ncells such as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release \nsyndrome, should only be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely \nmonitored throughout the first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced \ninfusion rate for the first infusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first \ncycle and any subsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count is still >25 x 109/L. \n \nInfusion related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7  \n\nrituximab (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in \n10 % of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of \nrituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic, and, occasionally, \noxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine \nrelease syndrome above for severe reactions. \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment \nof hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, \nshould   be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of \nrituximab. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of \nthe cytokine release syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been \nreported less frequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n \nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n \nSince hypotension may occur during rituximab administration, consideration should be given to \nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion. \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore, patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n \nHaematological toxicities \nAlthough rituximab is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L \nas clinical experience in this population is limited. Rituximab has been used in 21 patients who \nunderwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable \nreduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n \nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \nrituximab therapy. \n \nInfections \nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8). \nRituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history \nof recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose \npatients to serious infection (see section 4.8). \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving rituximab including \nfulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that \nrituximab treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus \n(HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At \nminimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with \nother appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not \nbe treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) \nshould consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed \nfollowing local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nVery rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during \npost-marketing use of rituximab in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8  \n\nreceived rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant. \n \nImmunisations \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following rituximab therapy has not been \nstudied for NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. \nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, with non-live vaccines \nresponse rates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL \nwho received rituximab monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower rate \nof response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet \nHaemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for >2-fold increase in antibody titer). \nFor CLL patients similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but \nthat has not been investigated in clinical trials. \n \nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \nA, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with rituximab. \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \nwith a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nMethotrexate (MTX) naïve populations with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe use of rituximab is not recommended in MTX-naïve patients since a favourable benefit risk \nrelationship has not been established. \n \nInfusion related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of \ncytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Premedication consisting of an analgesic/anti-pyretic \nmedicinal product and an anti-histaminic medicinal product, should always be administered before \neach infusion of rituximab. In rheumatoid arthritis premedication with glucocorticoids should also be \nadministered before each infusion of rituximab in order to reduce the frequency and severity of IRRs \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the \npost-marketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials \nwere mild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like headache, \npruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, the proportion \nof patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion than following \nthe second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with subsequent courses \n(see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction in rate, or \ninterruption, of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, and, \noccasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Closely \nmonitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior \ncardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required \ninterventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue rituximab. In most cases, the infusion can be \nresumed at a 50 % reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have completely \nresolved. \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), \nantihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic \nreaction during administration of rituximab. \n \nThere are no data on the safety of rituximab in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) \nor severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with rituximab, the occurrence of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9  \n\npre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been \nobserved, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, \nand those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions the risk of cardiovascular \ncomplications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with rituximab \nand patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab \ninfusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicinal product 12 hours \nprior to the rituximab infusion. \n \nIRRs for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis were similar to \nthose seen for rheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials (see section 4.8). \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with \na history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion related reactions, above). \n \nInfections \nBased on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B cells play an important \nrole in maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following \nrituximab therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy \nwith rituximab (see section 4.8).Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, \nsevere infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely \nimmunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should \nexercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or \nchronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious \ninfection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin \nlevels are determined prior to initiating treatment with rituximab. \n \nPatients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following rituximab therapy should be promptly \nevaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of rituximab treatment, \npatients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases \nincluding Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n \nHepatitis B Infections \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving \nrituximab. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment \nwith rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be \ncomplemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B \ndisease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either \nHBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be \nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n\n \nLate neutropenia \nMeasure blood neutrophils prior to each course of rituximab, and regularly up to 6-months \nafter cessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8). \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and \nStevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In \ncase of such an event with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10  \n\n \nImmunisation \nPhysicians should review the patient’s vaccination status and follow current immunisation \nguidelines prior to rituximab therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to \nfirst administration of rituximab. \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied. \nTherefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on rituximab or whilst \nperipherally B cell depleted. \n \nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, response rates to \nnon-live vaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated \nwith rituximab and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. \n42%), reduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 \npneumococcal antibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after \nrituximab as compared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be \nrequired whilst receiving rituximab therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to \ncommencing the next course of rituximab. \n \nIn the overall experience of rituximab repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the \nproportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, \nrubella, varicella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. \n \nConcomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis \nThe concomitant use of rituximab and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the \nrheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. \n \nThere are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other \nDMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following rituximab (see section 4.5). \nThe available data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such \ntherapies are used in patients previously treated with rituximab, however patients should be closely \nobserved for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following rituximab \ntherapy. \n \nMalignancy \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of \nlimited experience with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data \ndo not seem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the \ndevelopment of solid tumours cannot be excluded at this time. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCurrently, there are limited data on possible medicinal product interactions with rituximab. \n \nIn CLL patients, co-administration with rituximab did not appear to have an effect on the \npharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of \nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. \n \nCo-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients. \n\n \nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody or human anti-chimeric antibody (HAMA/HACA) \ntitres may have allergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or \ntherapeutic monoclonal antibodies. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic \nDMARD following rituximab. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11  \n\nrituximab was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following \ntreatment with the biologic DMARD. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \npotential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following \ntreatment with rituximab. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \nB cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to rituximab have not been studied in \nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \nmothers exposed to rituximab during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n(see section 5.3). For these reasons rituximab should not be administered to pregnant women unless \nthe possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women \nshould not breastfeed while treated with rituximab and for 12 months following rituximab treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of rituximab on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, \nalthough the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that rituximab \nwould have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL is based on data from \npatients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either \nwith rituximab monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction \ntreatment) or in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving rituximab were \nIRRs which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of \ninfusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after \neight doses of rituximab. \n\n \nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of \npatients during clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials \nin patients with CLL \n \nThe most frequent reported or observed serious adverse drug reactions were: \n IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12  \n\n Infections, see section 4.4. \n Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4. \n \nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy \nare summarised in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ \n1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< \n1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could \nnot be estimated, are listed under “not known”. \n \nTable 1  ADRs reported in clinical trials or during post-marketing surveillance in  \n\npatients with NHL and CLL disease treated with rituximab \nmonotherapy/maintenance or in combination with chemotherapy \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections \nand \ninfestations \n\nbacterial \ninfection, \nviral \ninfections, \n+bronchitis \n\nsepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile \ninfection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory \ntract \ninfection, fungal \ninfections, \ninfections of \nunknown \naetiology, \n+acute \nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \nhepatitis B1 \n\n serious viral \ninfection2 \nPneumocystis \njirovecii \n\nPML  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nneutropenia, \nleucopenia, \n+febrile \nneutropenia, \n+thrombocyt \nopenia \n\nanaemia, \n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytopen\nia \n\ncoagulation \ndisorders, \naplastic \nanaemia, \nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nlymphadenop\nathy \n\n transient \nincrease in \nserum IgM \nlevels3 \n\nlate \nneutropenia3 \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\ninfusion \nrelated \nreactions4, \nangioedema \n\nhypersensitivity  anaphylaxis tumour lysis \nsyndrome, \ncytokine \nrelease \nsyndrome4, \nserum \nsickness \n\ninfusion-relate\nd acute \nreversible \nthrombocytop\nenia4 \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n hyperglycaemia, \nweight \ndecrease, \nperipheral \noedema, face \noedema, \nincreased LDH, \nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  depression, \nnervousness, \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n paraesthesia, \nhypoaesthesia, \nagitation, \n\ndysgeusia  peripheral \nneuropathy, \nfacial nerve \n\ncranial \nneuropathy, \nloss of other \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13  \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\ninsomnia, \nvasodilatation, \ndizziness, \nanxiety \n\npalsy5 senses5 \n\nEye disorders  lacrimation \ndisorder, \nconjunctivitis \n\n  severe vision \nloss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n tinnitus, ear \npain \n\n   hearing loss5 \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n +myocardial \ninfarction4 and 6, \narrhythmia, \n+atrial \nfibrillation, \ntachycardia, \n+cardiac \ndisorder \n\n+left \nventricular \nfailure, \n+supraventri-\ncular \ntachycardia, \n+ventricular \ntachycardia, \n+angina, \n+myocardial \nischaemia, \nbradycardia \n\nsevere \ncardiac \ndisoders4 and 6 \n\nheart failure4 \nand 6 \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n hypertension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nhypotension \n\n  vasculitis \n(predominatel \ny cutaneous), \nleukocytoclast \nic vasculiti \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n bronchospasm4, \nrespiratory \ndisease, chest \npain, dyspnoea, \nincreased \ncough, \nrhinitis \n\nasthma, \nbronchiolitis \nobliterans, \nlung disorder, \nhypoxia \n\ninterstitial \nlung disease7 \n\nrespiratory \nfailure4 \n\nlung \ninfiltration \n\nGastrointesti\nnal disorders \n\nnausea vomiting , \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, \ndysphagia, \nstomatitis, \nconstipation, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia, throat \nirritation \n\nabdominal \nenlargement \n\n gastro-intestin \nal perforation7 \n\n \n\nSkin and \nSubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\npruritus, \nrash, \n+alopecia \n\nurticaria, \nsweating, night \nsweats, +skin \ndisorder \n\n  severe bullous \nskin reactions, \nStevens-Johns \non Syndrome \ntoxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nSyndrome)7, \n\n \n\nMusculoskele\ntal, \nconnective \ntissue and \nbone \ndisorders \n\n hypertonia, \nmyalgia, \narthralgia, back \npain, neck pain, \npain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    renal failure4  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministratio\nnsite \nconditions \n\nfever , chills, \nasthenia, \nheadache \n\ntumour pain, \nflushing, \nmalaise, \ncold syndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering, \n\ninfusion site \npain \n\n   \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14  \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\n+multi-organ \nfailure4 \n\nInvestigations decreased \nIgG levels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms marked \nwith \"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (≥ grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) reactions.

Rarely fatal cases reported \n5 signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of rituximab \ntherapy \n6 observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated \nwith infusion-related reactions \n7 includes fatal cases \n\n \nThe following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, \nwere reported at a similar or lower incidence in the rituximab-arms compared to control \narms: haematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, \npyrexia. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \nSigns and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50% \nof patients in clinical trials, and were predominantly seen during the first infusion, usually in the \nfirst one to two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other \nsymptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, \nfatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, \ndyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related \nreactions (such as bronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases. Additional \nreactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions \nsuch as angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, \nmyocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis \nsyndrome, cytokine release syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower \nor unknown frequencies. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially \nwith subsequent infusions and is <1% of patients by the eighth cycle of rituximab-containing \ntreatment. \n \nInfections \nRituximab induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with \ndecreased serum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients. \n \nLocalised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in \nthe rituximab-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about \n4% of patients treated with rituximab monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, \nincluding grade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during rituximab maintenance treatment up \nto 2 years when compared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of \ninfections reported over a 2 year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections \neither new, reactivated or exacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with \nrituximab treatment. The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination with \nchemotherapy or as part of a haematopoetic stem cell transplant. Examples of these serious \nviral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster \nVirus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n(PML)) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and \nretreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation,have \nbeen reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving rituximab in combination with \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15  \n\ncytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 \nhepatitis B infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs 0% FC. \nProgression of Kaposi’s sarcoma has been observed in rituximab-exposed patients with pre-\nexisting Kaposi’s sarcoma. These cases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority \nof patients were HIV positive. \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions \nIn clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) \nneutropenia was reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. \nDuring rituximab maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and \nneutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to \nobservation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (<1% , grade 3/4) and was not different \nbetween treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with rituximab in combination with \nchemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), \nneutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in \npreviously untreated CLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were \nusually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the \nhigher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy was not \nassociated with a higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with \nchemotherapy alone. Studies in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established \nthat in up to 25% of patients treated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil \ncount remaining below 1x109/L between day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late \nonset (defined as neutrophil count below 1x109/L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with \nno previous prolonged neutropenia or who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with \nrituximab plus FC. There were no differences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of \nlate neutropenia occurring more than four weeks after the last infusion of rituximab were reported. \nIn the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C patients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm \ncompared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade ¾ \nthrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in \nthe FC group. \n \nIn studies of rituximab in patients with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least \nbaseline level within 4 months. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade \n3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during \ninfusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders \nwas comparable between patients treated with rituximab and observation. Cardiac events were \nreported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular \nfailure, myocardial ischaemia) in 3% of patients treated with rituximab compared to <1% on \nobservation. In studies evaluating rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a rituximab \ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease. In CLL, the overall \nincidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and \nin the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC). \n\n \nRespiratory system \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16  \n\nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome, have been reported. \n \nNeurologic disorders \nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \ncycles), four patients (2 %) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \npatients (1.5 %) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \nfollow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low \nboth in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% \nFC). \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \nrituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, rituximab was \nadministered with chemotherapy. \n \nIgG levels \nIn the clinical trial evaluating rituximab maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (<7 g/L) after induction \ntreatment in both the observation and the rituximab groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the rituximab group. The \nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the rituximab group \nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after 2 \nyears). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been \nobserved in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nPatient subpopulations - rituximab monotherapy \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years): \nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3 /4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared \nto younger patients (<65 years). \n \nBulky disease \nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \nwithout bulky disease (25.6 % vs. 15.4 %). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in \nthese two groups. \n \nRe-treatment \nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of rituximab was \nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \nADRs). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17  \n\nPatient subpopulations - rituximab combination therapy \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) \nThe incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients \ncompared to younger patients (<65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory \nCLL. \n \nSummary of the safety profile (rheumatoid arthritis) \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from \nclinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is \nsummarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3,100 patients received at least one \ntreatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; \napproximately 2,400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1,000 having \nreceived 5 or more courses. The safety information collected during post-marketing experience \nreflects the expected adverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for rituximab (see section 4.4). \n\n \nPatients received 2 x 1,000 mg of rituximab separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to \nmethotrexate (10-25 mg/week). Rituximab infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion \nof 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nFrequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100) and very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of rituximab were IRRs. The overall \nincidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent \ninfusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during \nthe initial course. In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for rituximab, \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like \nreaction have been reported during post marketing experience. \n \nTable 2 Summary of adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials or during post \n\nmarketing surveillance occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving \nrituximab \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nupper respiratory \ntract infection, \nurinary tract \ninfections \n\nbronchitis, \nsinusitis, \ngastroenteritis, \ntinea pedis \n\n  PML, \nreactivation of \nhepatitis B \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n neutropenia1  late neutropenia2 serum sickness- \nlike reaction \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n3infusion related \nreactions \n(hypertension, \nnausea, rash, \n\n 3infusion related \nreactions \n(generalised \noedema, \n\n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18  \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\npyrexia, pruritus, \nurticaria, throat \nirritation, hot \nflush, \nhypotension, \nrhinitis, rigors, \ntachycardia, \nfatigue, \noropharyngeal \npain, peripheral \noedema, \nerythma) \n\n bronchospasm, \nwheezing, \nlaryngeal \noedema, \nangioneurotic \noedema, \ngeneralised \npruritis, \nanaphylaxis, \nanaphylactoid \nreaction) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutritional \nDisorders \n\n hypercholesterole\nmia \n\n   \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n depression, \nanxiety \n\n   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache paraesthesia, \nmigraine, \ndizziness, sciatica \n\n   \n\nCardiac disorders    angina pectoris, \natrial fibrillation, \nheart failure, \nmyocardial \ninfarction \n\natrial flutter \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n dyspepsia, \ndiarrhoea, gastro-\noesophageal \nreflux, mouth \nulceration, upper \nabdominal pain \n\n   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n alopecia   toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nSyndrome), \nStevens-Johnson \nSyndrome5 \n\nMusculo-\nskeletal \ndisorders \n\n arthralgia / \nmusculoskeletal \npain, \nosteoarthritis, \nbursitis \n\n   \n\nInvestigations decreased IgM \nlevels4 \n\ndecreased IgG \nlevels4 \n\n   \n\n1 Frequency category derived from laboratory values collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring in clinical trials \n2 Frequency category derived from post-marketing data. \n3 Reactions occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion.

The rate of all ADRs following first rituximab exposure was highest during the first \n6 months and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the \nfirst treatment course), RA exacerbation and infections all of which were more frequent in the first \n6 months of treatment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19  \n\n \nInfusion-related reactions \nThe most frequent ADRs following receipt of rituximab in clinical studies were IRRs. Among the \n3189 patients treated with rituximab, 1,135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR with \n733/3,189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to \nrituximab. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than 1% \n(17/3189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no deaths \ndue to IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events, and of IRRs leading to \nwithdrawal decreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with \nintravenous glucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the postmarketing setting. \n \nIn a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid rituximab infusion in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious \nIRR during or within 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour \nintravenous infusion of rituximab. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic \ntherapy for RA were excluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent \nwith that observed historically. No serious IRRs were observed. \n \nInfections \nThe overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in rituximab treated \npatients. The infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper \nrespiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious \nor required IV antibiotics, was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections \ndid not show any significant increase following multiple courses of rituximab. Lower respiratory \ntract infections (including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence \nin the rituximab-arms compared to control arms. \n \nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid \narthritis and off-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and \nvasculitis. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). \nReactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients \nreceiving rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nSerious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the rituximab treated \npatients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients \nexperiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n\n \nNeutropenia \nEvents of neutropenia were observed with rituximab treatment, the majority of which were \ntransient and mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the \nadministration of rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nIn placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1382) of rituximab treated patients and \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20  \n\n0.27% (2/731) of placebo-treated patients developed severe neutropenia. \n \nNeutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported \nin the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA \npatients treated with rituximab. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections \nafter the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \nin paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nSummary of the Safety Profile (granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis) \n \nIn the clinical trial in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangitis, 99 patients were \ntreated with rituximab (375 mg/m2, once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe ADRs listed in Table 3 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% in the \nrituximab group. \n \nTable 3 Adverse drug reactions occurring at 6-months in ≥ 5% of patients receiving \n\nrituximab, and at a higher frequency than the comparator group, in the \npivotal clinical study. \n\nBody system \nAdverse reaction \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nInfections and infestations \nUrinary tract infection 7% \nBronchitis 5% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nNasopharyngitis 5% \n\nBlood and lymphatic  \nsystem disorders \n\nThrombocytopenia 7% \nImmune system disorders \n\nCytokine release syndrome 5% \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHyperkalaemia 5% \nPsychiatric disorders \n\nInsomnia 14% \nNervous system disorders \n\nDizziness 10% \nTremor 10% \n\nVascular disorders \nHypertension 12% \nFlushing 5% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21  \n\nBody system \nAdverse reaction \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and  \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough 12% \nDyspnoea 11% \nEpistaxis 11% \nNasal congestion 6% \n\nGastrointestinal  \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea 18% \nDyspepsia 6% \nConstipation 5% \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \ntissue disorders \n\nAcne 7% \nMusculoskeletal and connective  \ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms 18% \nArthralgia 15% \nBack pain 10% \nMuscle weakness 5% \nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nPain in extremities 5% \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site conditions \n\nPeripheral oedema 16% \nInvestigations \n\nDecreased haemoglobin 6% \n \nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n \nInfusion related reactions \nIRRs in the GPA and MPA clinical trial were defined as any adverse event occurring within 24 \nhours of an infusion and considered to be infusion-related by investigators in the safety population. \nNinety nine patients were treated with rituximab and 12% experienced at least one IRR. All IRRs \nwere CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs included cytokine release syndrome, flushing, \nthroat irritation, and tremor. Rituximab was given in combination with intravenous glucocorticoids \nwhich may reduce the incidence and severity of these events. \n \nInfections \nIn the 99 rituximab patients, the overall rate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years \n(95% CI 197-285) at the 6-month primary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate \nand consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. \n \nThe rate of serious infections was approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently \nreported serious infection in the rituximab group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%. \n \nMalignancies \nThe incidence of malignancy in rituximab treated patients in the granulomatosis with polyangiitis and \nmicroscopic polyangiitis clinical study was 2.00 per 100 patient years at the study common closing \ndate (when the final patient had completed the follow-up period). On the basis of standardised \nincidence ratios, the incidence of malignancies appears to be similar to that previously reported in \npatients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22  \n\n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately 273 per 100 patient years (95% CI 149-470) at the \n6-month primary endpoint. The rate of serious cardiac events was 2.1 per 100 patient years (95% CI \n3-15). The most frequently reported events were tachycardia (4%) and atrial fibrillation (3%) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and \nsymptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without \nassociated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The \nreported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, \nhypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nA small number of cases of hepatitis B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab in the post-\nmarketing setting. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients treated with rituximab. At 6 \nmonths, in the active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial, in the \nrituximab group, 27%, 58% and 51% of patients with normal immunoglobulin levels at baseline, had \nlow IgA, IgG and IgM levels, respectively compared to 25%, 50% and 46% in the \ncyclophosphamide group. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections in \npatients with low IgA, IgG or IgM. \n \nNeutropenia \nIn the active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial of rituximab in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, 24% of patients in the rituximab \ngroup (single course) and 23% of patients in the cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or \ngreater neutropenia. Neutropenia was not associated with an observed increase in serious infection in \nrituximab-treated patients. The effect of multiple rituximab courses on the development of \nneutropenia in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients has not been \nstudied in clinical trials. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous rituximab formulation \nis available from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of rituximab tested in \nhumans to date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No \nadditional safety signals were identified. \n \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23  \n\nmonitored. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting five cases of rituximab overdose have been reported. Three cases had \nno reported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with \na dose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC02  \n \nRituzena is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on >95 % of \nall B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. \n \nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, \npro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalize \nupon antibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the \nplasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n \nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on \nthe surface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B \nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n \nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. \nIn patients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of \ntreatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, \nalthough in some patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months \npost-induction therapy). In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic \npolyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells decreased to <10 cells/μL after two weekly \ninfusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that level in most patients up to the 6 month time \npoint. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, with counts >10 cells/μL by \nmonth 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. \n \nClinical experience in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nFollicular lymphoma \n \nMonotherapy \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL \nreceived 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall \nresponse rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48 % (CI95% 41% - 56%) with a 6% \ncomplete response (CR) and a 42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to \nprogression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was \nhigher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58% \nvs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was < 5 cm vs. > 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. \n38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24  \n\nduration of response < 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with \nautologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. \nNeither age, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence or absence of bulky disease, normal or \nhigh LDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher’s exact test) \non response to rituximab. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response rates and \nbone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded compared to \n59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not supported by a \nstepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as prognostic \nfactors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and bulky \ndisease. \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 8 doses \nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The \nORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% – 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected \nmedian TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). \n \nInitial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses \nIn pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single \nlesion ≥ 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as \nintravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36 % (CI95% 21% – 51%; CR 3%, PR \n33%) with a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). \n \nRe-treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of rituximab, were \nre-treated with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the \npatients had received two courses of rituximab before enrolment and thus were given a third course \nin the study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the \nORR was 38% (CI95 % 26% – 51%; 10% CR, 28% PR) with a projected median TTP for \nresponding patients of 17.8 months (range 5.4 – 26.6). This compares favourably with the TTP \nachieved after the prior course of rituximab (12.4 months). \n \nInitial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy \n \nIn an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular \nlymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, \nvincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on \ndays 1 -5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or rituximab 375 mg/m2 in combination with CVP (R-\nCVP). Rituximab was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 \npatients (162 R-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median \nfollow up of patients was 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the \nprimary endpoint, time to treatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p < 0.0001, log-rank test). \nThe proportion of patients with a tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p< \n0.0001 Chi-Square test) in the R-CVP group (80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment \nwith R-CVP significantly prolonged the time  to disease progression or death compared to CVP, \n33.6 months and 14.7 months, respectively (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of \nresponse was 37.7 months in the R-CVP group and was 13.5 months in the CVP group (p < \n0.0001, log-rank test). \n \nThe difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant \nclinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were \n80.9% for patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1 % for patients in the CVP group．  \n \nResults from three other randomised trials using rituximab in combination with chemotherapy \nregimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferon-α) have also demonstrated significant \nimprovements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival.

Rituzena was administered on the first day of the \ntreatment cycle. \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a \nmedian follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well \nbalanced in baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that R-\nCHOP treatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in \nthe duration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse \nor progression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p = 0.0001). Kaplan \nMeier estimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm \ncompared to 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41 %. At 24 months, \nestimates for overall survival were 68.2 % in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4 % in the CHOP arm. \nA subsequent analysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up \nduration of 60 months, confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), \nrepresenting a risk reduction of 32 %. \n \nThe analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free \nsurvival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP.

In all patients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β2 \nmicroglobulin, LDH, albumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow \ninvolvement), the risk ratios for event-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with \nCHOP) were less than 0.83 and 0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in \noutcome for both high- and low-risk patients according to age adjusted IPI. \n \nClinical laboratory findings \n \nOf 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of \n356 patients evaluated for HACA, 1.1 % (4 patients) were positive. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nIn two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients \nwith relapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 \nmg/m2, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or rituximab in \ncombination with FC (R-FC). Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m2 during the first \ncycle one day prior to chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each subsequent \ntreatment cycle. Patients were excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had \npreviously been treated with monoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to \nachieve a partial remission for at least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total \nof 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 FC) for the first-line study (Table 5a and Table 5b) and 552 patients \n(276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the relapsed/refractory study (Table 6) were analysed for efficacy. \n \nIn the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 \nmonths in the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of \noverall survival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone (p = \n0.0319, log-rank test) (Table 5a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most \npatient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 5b). \n \nTable 5a First-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nOverview of efficacy results for rituximab plus FC vs. FC alone - 48.1 months \nmedian observation time \n\nEfficacy parameter Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time \nto event (months) \n\nRisk \nreduction \n\nFC \n(N = 409) \n\nR-FC \n(N=408) \n\nLog-rank \np value \n\nProgression‐free survival (PFS) 32.8 55.3 <0.0001 45% \nOverall survival NR NR 0.0319 27% \nEvent free survival 31.3 51.8 <0.0001 44% \nResponse rate (CR, nPR, or PR) \nCR rates \n\n72.6% \n16.9% \n\n85.8% \n36.0% \n\n<0.0001 \n<0.0001 \n\nn.a. \nn.a. \n\nDuration of response* 36.2 57.3 <0.0001 44% \nDisease free survival (DFS)** 48.9 60.3 0.0520 31% \nTime to new treatment 47.2 69.7 <0.0001 42% \n\nResponse rate and CR rates analysed using Chi-squared Test.

All patients in the \ncyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy during follow-up. Patients in both \narms received 1000mg of pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose \nglucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 \nmg/day). Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of study treatment. \n \nThe primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a \nBirmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener’s granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off \nglucocorticoid therapy. The prespecified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was 20%. \nThe trial demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete remission \n(CR) at 6 months (Table 7). \n \nEfficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing \ndisease (Table 8). \n\n \nTable 7 Percentage of patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months \n\n(Intent-to-treat population*) \n \n\nRituximab \n(n = 99) \n\nCyclophosphamide \n(n = 98) \n\nTreatment difference \n(Rituximab \n\n--cyclophosphamide) \n\nRate 63.6% 53.1% \n10.6% \n\n95.1%b CI \n(−3.2%, 24.3%) a \n\n– CI = confidence interval. \n– * Worst case imputation \na Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound (−3.2%) was higher than the pre-determined  \n\nnon-inferiority margin ( − 20%). \nb The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy analysis. \n\n \nTable 8 Complete remission at 6-months by disease status \n Rituximab Cyclophosphamide Difference (CI 95%) \nAll patients \nNewly \ndiagnosed \n\n \n\nn=99 \nn=48 \nn=51 \n\nn=98 \nn=48 \nn=50 \n\n \n\nComplete remission \nAll Patients 63.6% 53.1% 10.6% (‐3.2, 24.3) \nNewly diagnosed 60.4% 64.6% − 4.2% (− 23.6, 15.3) \nRelapsing 66.7% 42.0% 24.7% (5.8, 43.6) \n\nWorst case imputation is applied for patients with missing data \n \nComplete remission at 12 and 18 months \nIn the rituximab group, 48% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 39% of patients achieved \nCR at 18 months.

From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the \nrituximab group compared with four in the cyclophosphamide group. \n \nRetreatment with rituximab \nBased upon investigator judgment, 15 patients received a second course of rituximab therapy for \ntreatment of relapse of disease activity which occurred between 6 and 18 months after the first \ncourse of rituximab.

When remission with \nrituximab has been achieved, continued immunosuppressive therapy may be considered to prevent \nrelapse. The efficacy and safety of rituximab in maintenance therapy has not been established. \n\n \nLaboratory evaluations \n \nA total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated patients in the trial tested positive for HACA by 18 months. \nNone of the 99 rituximab-treated patients were HACA positive at screening. The clinical relevance of \nHACA formation in rituximab-treated patients is unclear. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or \nmultiple infusions of rituximab as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied \nrituximab doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m2), the typical population estimates of nonspecific \nclearance (CL1), specific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and \ncentral compartment volume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/day, 0.59 L/day, and 2.7 L, \nrespectively. The estimated median terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22 days (range, \n6.1 to 52 days). Baseline CD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions \ncontributed to some of the variability in CL2 of rituximab in data from 161 patients given 375 \nmg/m2 as an intravenous infusion for 4  weekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell \ncounts or tumour lesions had a higher CL2. However, a large component of inter-individual \nvariability remained for CL2 after correction for CD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. \nV1 varied by body surface area (BSA) and CHOP therapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) \ncontributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m2) and concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were \nrelatively small. Age, gender and WHO performance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nrituximab. This analysis suggests that dose adjustment of rituximab with any of the tested covariates \nis not expected to result in a meaningful reduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. \n \nRituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at weekly intervals for 4 \ndoses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth \ninfusion of 486 µg/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of \npatients 3 – 6 months after completion of last treatment. \n \nUpon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly \nintervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive \ninfusion, spanning from a mean of 243 µg/mL (range, 16 – 582 µg/mL) after the first infusion to 550 \nµg/mL (range, 171 – 1177 µg/mL) after the eighth infusion. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in \ncombination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nRituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m2 increased \nto 500 mg/m2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL \npatients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 µg/mL (range, 97 – 764 µg/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/ \nm2 infusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 – 62 days). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n30  \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nFollowing two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean \nterminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day \n(range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to 7.51 \nL). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic \nclearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis \nrevealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual \nvariability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger volume \nof distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender- related pharmacokinetic \ndifferences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not required. No \npharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous (IV) doses of 500 mg \nand 1000 mg on Days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were \ndose proportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first \ninfusion ranged from 157 to 171 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 µg/mL for 2 \nx 1000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 µg/mL for the2 x \n500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 µg/mL for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination \nhalf-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 x 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for the 2 x 1000 \nmg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared to the first \ninfusion for both doses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two IV doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg \nupon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion was \n170 to 175 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 µg/mL for 2 x 1000 mg dose. Cmax following \nsecond infusion, was 207 µg/mL for the 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 377 to 386 µg/mL for the 2 \nx 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second infusion, following the second \ncourse, was 19 days for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. \nPK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment courses. \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the \nsame dosage regimen (2 x 1000 mg, IV, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum serum \nconcentration of 369 µg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m2 rituximab once weekly for four \ndoses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 to 49 days). \nRituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 to 0.726 \nL/day) and 4.50 L (range 2.25 to 7.39 L) respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in these \npatients appear similar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion \nof B cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the \nfoetus due to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the \nlymphoid organs of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied \nby a decrease in IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these \nanimals within 6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31  \n\nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \nfor this molecule.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion.  \nClear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRituzena is indicated in adults for the following indications:  \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) \n \nRituzena is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular \nlymphoma in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nRituzena monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma \nwho are chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. \n \nRituzena is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \nprednisolone) chemotherapy. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) \n \nRituzena in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously \nuntreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. Only limited data are available on efficacy and safety for \npatients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including Rituzena or patients refractory to \nprevious Rituzena plus chemotherapy. \n \nSee section 5.1 for further information. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34  \n\n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nRituzena, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in adult \npatients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic \npolyangiitis (MPA). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRituzena should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of Rituzena. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL, premedication with glucocorticoids should be \nconsidered if Rituzena is not given in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy. \n \nIn patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) or microscopic polyangiitis, \nmethylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a dose of 1000 mg per day is \nrecommended prior to the first infusion of Rituzena (the last dose of methylprednisolone may be \ngiven on the same day as the first infusion of Rituzena). This should be followed by oral prednisone \n1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as possible based on clinical need) \nduring and after Rituzena treatment. \n \nPosology \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nCombination therapy \nThe recommended dose of Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of \npreviously untreated or relapsed/ refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m2 body \nsurface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. \nRituzena should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous \nadministration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. \n\n \n \nMonotherapy \n\n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Rituzena monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with \nstage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse \nafter chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once \nweekly for four weeks. \n \nFor retreatment with Rituzena monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment \nwith Rituzena monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks \n(see section 5.1). \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nRituzena should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dosage is \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle for 8 cycles after \nintravenous infusion of the glucocorticoid component of CHOP. Safety and efficacy of Rituzena \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35  \n\nhave not been established in combination with other chemotherapies in diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nNo dose reductions of Rituzena are recommended. When Rituzena is given in combination with \nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \napplied. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nProphylaxis with adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics starting 48 hours prior to \nstart of therapy is recommended for CLL patients to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. For \nCLL patients whose lymphocyte counts are > 25 x 109/L it is recommended to administer \nprednisone/prednisolone 100 mg intravenous shortly before infusion with Rituzena to decrease the \nrate and severity of acute infusion reactions and/or cytokine release syndrome. \n \nThe recommended dosage of Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated \nand relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first \ntreatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each \nsubsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total. The chemotherapy should be given after Rituzena infusion. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nPatients treated with Rituzena must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nThe recommended dosage of Rituzena for induction of remission therapy of granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an \nintravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (four infusions in total). \n \nPneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for patients with \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis during and following Rituzena \ntreatment, as appropriate. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged >65 years). \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Rituzena in children below 18 years has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe prepared Rituzena solution should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a \ndedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). \nPatients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or \nhypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \nshould then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory \ntests and, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be \nrestarted until complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest \nX-ray findings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the \nprevious rate. If the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the \ntreatment should be seriously considered on a case by case basis. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36  \n\n \nMild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (section 4.8) usually respond to a \nreduction in the rate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of \nsymptoms. \n \nFirst infusion \n \nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated \nin 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nSubsequent infusions \n \nAll indications \n \nSubsequent doses of Rituzena can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by \n100 mg/h increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nContraindications for use in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nContraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic \npolyangiitis \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nSevere heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease \n(see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n \nAll patients treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and \nmicroscopic polyangiitis must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. The alert card \ncontains important safety information for patients regarding potential increased risk of infections, \nincluding PML. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following the use of rituximab. Patients must be \nmonitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be \nsuggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been \nexcluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37  \n\nneurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. \nConsultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. \n \nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered. \n \nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \npatient is not aware of. \n \nIf a patient develops PML the dosing of rituximab must be permanently discontinued.  \n \nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML \nand suspension of rituximab therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nInfusion related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines \nand/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable \nfrom acute hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and \nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. \n \nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use \nof the rituximab intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \nstarting the first rituximab intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and \nin some cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to \nfever, chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by \nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or \noedema, visible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours \nof initiating the first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with \npulmonary tumour infiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with \nincreased caution. Patients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion \ninterrupted immediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. \nSince initial improvement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients \nshould be closely monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been \nresolved or ruled out. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms \nhas rarely resulted in repeated severe cytokine release syndrome. \n \nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (≥25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant \ncells such as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release \nsyndrome, should only be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely \nmonitored throughout the first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced \ninfusion rate for the first infusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first \ncycle and any subsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count is still >25 x 109/L. \n \nInfusion related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38  \n\nrituximab (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in \n10 % of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of \nrituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic, and, occasionally, \noxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine \nrelease syndrome above for severe reactions. \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment \nof hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, \nshould   be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of \nrituximab. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of \nthe cytokine release syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been \nreported less frequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n \nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n \nSince hypotension may occur during rituximab administration, consideration should be given to \nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion. \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore, patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n \nHaematological toxicities \nAlthough rituximab is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L \nas clinical experience in this population is limited. Rituximab has been used in 21 patients who \nunderwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable \nreduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n \nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \nrituximab therapy. \n \nInfections \nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8). \nRituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history \nof recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose \npatients to serious infection (see section 4.8). \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving rituximab including \nfulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that \nrituximab treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus \n(HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At \nminimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with \nother appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not \nbe treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) \nshould consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed \nfollowing local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nVery rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during \npost-marketing use of rituximab in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39  \n\nreceived rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant. \n \nImmunisations \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following rituximab therapy has not been \nstudied for NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. \nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, with non-live vaccines \nresponse rates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL \nwho received rituximab monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower rate \nof response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet \nHaemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for >2-fold increase in antibody titer). \nFor CLL patients similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but \nthat has not been investigated in clinical trials. \n \nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \nA, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with rituximab. \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \nwith a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nMethotrexate (MTX) naïve populations with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe use of rituximab is not recommended in MTX-naïve patients since a favourable benefit risk \nrelationship has not been established. \n \nInfusion related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of \ncytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Premedication consisting of an analgesic/anti-pyretic \nmedicinal product and an anti-histaminic medicinal product, should always be administered before \neach infusion of rituximab. In rheumatoid arthritis premedication with glucocorticoids should also be \nadministered before each infusion of rituximab in order to reduce the frequency and severity of IRRs \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the \npost-marketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials \nwere mild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like headache, \npruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, the proportion \nof patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion than following \nthe second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with subsequent courses \n(see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction in rate, or \ninterruption, of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, and, \noccasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Closely \nmonitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior \ncardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required \ninterventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue rituximab. In most cases, the infusion can be \nresumed at a 50 % reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have completely \nresolved. \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), \nantihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic \nreaction during administration of rituximab. \n \nThere are no data on the safety of rituximab in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) \nor severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with rituximab, the occurrence of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40  \n\npre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been \nobserved, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, \nand those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions the risk of cardiovascular \ncomplications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with rituximab \nand patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab \ninfusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicinal product 12 hours \nprior to the rituximab infusion. \n \nIRRs for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis were similar to \nthose seen for rheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials (see section 4.8). \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with \na history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion related reactions, above). \n \nInfections \nBased on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B cells play an important \nrole in maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following \nrituximab therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy \nwith rituximab (see section 4.8).Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, \nsevere infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely \nimmunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should \nexercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or \nchronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious \ninfection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin \nlevels are determined prior to initiating treatment with rituximab. \n \nPatients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following rituximab therapy should be promptly \nevaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of rituximab treatment, \npatients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases \nincluding Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n \nHepatitis B Infections \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving \nrituximab. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment \nwith rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be \ncomplemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B \ndisease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either \nHBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be \nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n\n \nLate neutropenia \nMeasure blood neutrophils prior to each course of rituximab, and regularly up to 6-months \nafter cessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8). \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and \nStevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In \ncase of such an event with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41  \n\n \nImmunisation \nPhysicians should review the patient’s vaccination status and follow current immunisation \nguidelines prior to rituximab therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to \nfirst administration of rituximab. \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied. \nTherefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on rituximab or whilst \nperipherally B cell depleted. \n \nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, response rates to \nnon-live vaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated \nwith rituximab and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. \n42%), reduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 \npneumococcal antibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after \nrituximab as compared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be \nrequired whilst receiving rituximab therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to \ncommencing the next course of rituximab. \n \nIn the overall experience of rituximab repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the \nproportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, \nrubella, varicella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. \n \nConcomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis \nThe concomitant use of rituximab and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the \nrheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. \n \nThere are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other \nDMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following rituximab (see section 4.5). \nThe available data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such \ntherapies are used in patients previously treated with rituximab, however patients should be closely \nobserved for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following rituximab \ntherapy. \n \nMalignancy \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of \nlimited experience with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data \ndo not seem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the \ndevelopment of solid tumours cannot be excluded at this time. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCurrently, there are limited data on possible medicinal product interactions with rituximab. \n \nIn CLL patients, co-administration with rituximab did not appear to have an effect on the \npharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of \nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. \n \nCo-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients. \n\n \nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody or human anti-chimeric antibody (HAMA/HACA) \ntitres may have allergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or \ntherapeutic monoclonal antibodies. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic \nDMARD following rituximab. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42  \n\nrituximab was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following \ntreatment with the biologic DMARD. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \npotential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following \ntreatment with rituximab. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \nB cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to rituximab have not been studied in \nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \nmothers exposed to rituximab during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n(see section 5.3). For these reasons rituximab should not be administered to pregnant women unless \nthe possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women \nshould not breastfeed while treated with rituximab and for 12 months following rituximab treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of rituximab on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, \nalthough the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that rituximab \nwould have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL is based on data from \npatients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either \nwith rituximab monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction \ntreatment) or in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving rituximab were \nIRRs which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of \ninfusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after \neight doses of rituximab. \n\n \nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of \npatients during clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials \nin patients with CLL \n \nThe most frequent reported or observed serious adverse drug reactions were: \n IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n43  \n\n Infections, see section 4.4. \n Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4. \n \nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy \nare summarised in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ \n1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< \n1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could \nnot be estimated, are listed under “not known”. \n \nTable 1  ADRs reported in clinical trials or during post-marketing surveillance in  \n\npatients with NHL and CLL disease treated with rituximab \nmonotherapy/maintenance or in combination with chemotherapy \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections \nand \ninfestations \n\nbacterial \ninfection, \nviral \ninfections, \n+bronchitis \n\nsepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile \ninfection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory \ntract \ninfection, fungal \ninfections, \ninfections of \nunknown \naetiology, \n+acute \nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \nhepatitis B1 \n\n serious viral \ninfection2 \nPneumocystis \njirovecii \n\nPML  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nneutropenia, \nleucopenia, \n+febrile \nneutropenia, \n+thrombocyt \nopenia \n\nanaemia, \n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytopen\nia \n\ncoagulation \ndisorders, \naplastic \nanaemia, \nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nlymphadenop\nathy \n\n transient \nincrease in \nserum IgM \nlevels3 \n\nlate \nneutropenia3 \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\ninfusion \nrelated \nreactions4, \nangioedema \n\nhypersensitivity  anaphylaxis tumour lysis \nsyndrome, \ncytokine \nrelease \nsyndrome4, \nserum \nsickness \n\ninfusion-relate\nd acute \nreversible \nthrombocytop\nenia4 \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n hyperglycaemia, \nweight \ndecrease, \nperipheral \noedema, face \noedema, \nincreased LDH, \nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  depression, \nnervousness, \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n paraesthesia, \nhypoaesthesia, \nagitation, \n\ndysgeusia  peripheral \nneuropathy, \nfacial nerve \n\ncranial \nneuropathy, \nloss of other \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n44  \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\ninsomnia, \nvasodilatation, \ndizziness, \nanxiety \n\npalsy5 senses5 \n\nEye disorders  lacrimation \ndisorder, \nconjunctivitis \n\n  severe vision \nloss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n tinnitus, ear \npain \n\n   hearing loss5 \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n +myocardial \ninfarction4 and 6, \narrhythmia, \n+atrial \nfibrillation, \ntachycardia, \n+cardiac \ndisorder \n\n+left \nventricular \nfailure, \n+supraventri-\ncular \ntachycardia, \n+ventricular \ntachycardia, \n+angina, \n+myocardial \nischaemia, \nbradycardia \n\nsevere \ncardiac \ndisoders4 and 6 \n\nheart failure4 \nand 6 \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n hypertension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nhypotension \n\n  vasculitis \n(predominatel \ny cutaneous), \nleukocytoclast \nic vasculiti \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n bronchospasm4, \nrespiratory \ndisease, chest \npain, dyspnoea, \nincreased \ncough, \nrhinitis \n\nasthma, \nbronchiolitis \nobliterans, \nlung disorder, \nhypoxia \n\ninterstitial \nlung disease7 \n\nrespiratory \nfailure4 \n\nlung \ninfiltration \n\nGastrointesti\nnal disorders \n\nnausea vomiting , \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, \ndysphagia, \nstomatitis, \nconstipation, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia, throat \nirritation \n\nabdominal \nenlargement \n\n gastro-intestin \nal perforation7 \n\n \n\nSkin and \nSubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\npruritus, \nrash, \n+alopecia \n\nurticaria, \nsweating, night \nsweats, +skin \ndisorder \n\n  severe bullous \nskin reactions, \nStevens-Johns \non Syndrome \ntoxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nSyndrome)7, \n\n \n\nMusculoskele\ntal, \nconnective \ntissue and \nbone \ndisorders \n\n hypertonia, \nmyalgia, \narthralgia, back \npain, neck pain, \npain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    renal failure4  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministratio\nnsite \nconditions \n\nfever , chills, \nasthenia, \nheadache \n\ntumour pain, \nflushing, \nmalaise, \ncold syndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering, \n\ninfusion site \npain \n\n   \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n45  \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\n+multi-organ \nfailure4 \n\nInvestigations decreased \nIgG levels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms marked \nwith \"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (≥ grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) reactions.

Rarely fatal cases reported \n5 signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of rituximab \ntherapy \n6 observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated \nwith infusion-related reactions \n7 includes fatal cases \n\n \nThe following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, \nwere reported at a similar or lower incidence in the rituximab-arms compared to control \narms: haematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, \npyrexia. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \nSigns and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50% \nof patients in clinical trials, and were predominantly seen during the first infusion, usually in the \nfirst one to two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other \nsymptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, \nfatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, \ndyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related \nreactions (such as bronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases. Additional \nreactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions \nsuch as angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, \nmyocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis \nsyndrome, cytokine release syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower \nor unknown frequencies. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially \nwith subsequent infusions and is <1% of patients by the eighth cycle of rituximab-containing \ntreatment. \n \nInfections \nRituximab induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with \ndecreased serum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients. \n \nLocalised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in \nthe rituximab-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about \n4% of patients treated with rituximab monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, \nincluding grade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during rituximab maintenance treatment up \nto 2 years when compared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of \ninfections reported over a 2 year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections \neither new, reactivated or exacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with \nrituximab treatment. The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination with \nchemotherapy or as part of a haematopoetic stem cell transplant. Examples of these serious \nviral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster \nVirus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n(PML)) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and \nretreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation,have \nbeen reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving rituximab in combination with \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n46  \n\ncytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 \nhepatitis B infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs 0% FC. \nProgression of Kaposi’s sarcoma has been observed in rituximab-exposed patients with pre-\nexisting Kaposi’s sarcoma. These cases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority \nof patients were HIV positive. \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions \nIn clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) \nneutropenia was reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. \nDuring rituximab maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and \nneutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to \nobservation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (<1% , grade 3/4) and was not different \nbetween treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with rituximab in combination with \nchemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), \nneutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in \npreviously untreated CLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were \nusually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the \nhigher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy was not \nassociated with a higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with \nchemotherapy alone. Studies in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established \nthat in up to 25% of patients treated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil \ncount remaining below 1x109/L between day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late \nonset (defined as neutrophil count below 1x109/L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with \nno previous prolonged neutropenia or who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with \nrituximab plus FC. There were no differences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of \nlate neutropenia occurring more than four weeks after the last infusion of rituximab were reported. \nIn the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C patients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm \ncompared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade ¾ \nthrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in \nthe FC group. \n \nIn studies of rituximab in patients with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least \nbaseline level within 4 months. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade \n3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during \ninfusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders \nwas comparable between patients treated with rituximab and observation. Cardiac events were \nreported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular \nfailure, myocardial ischaemia) in 3% of patients treated with rituximab compared to <1% on \nobservation. In studies evaluating rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a rituximab \ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease. In CLL, the overall \nincidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and \nin the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC). \n\n \nRespiratory system \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n47  \n\nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome, have been reported. \n \nNeurologic disorders \nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \ncycles), four patients (2 %) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \npatients (1.5 %) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \nfollow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low \nboth in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% \nFC). \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \nrituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, rituximab was \nadministered with chemotherapy. \n \nIgG levels \nIn the clinical trial evaluating rituximab maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (<7 g/L) after induction \ntreatment in both the observation and the rituximab groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the rituximab group. The \nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the rituximab group \nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after 2 \nyears). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been \nobserved in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nPatient subpopulations - rituximab monotherapy \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years): \nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3 /4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared \nto younger patients (<65 years). \n \nBulky disease \nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \nwithout bulky disease (25.6 % vs. 15.4 %). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in \nthese two groups. \n \nRe-treatment \nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of rituximab was \nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \nADRs). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n48  \n\nPatient subpopulations - rituximab combination therapy \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) \nThe incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients \ncompared to younger patients (<65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory \nCLL. \n \nSummary of the safety profile (rheumatoid arthritis) \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from \nclinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is \nsummarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3,100 patients received at least one \ntreatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; \napproximately 2,400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1,000 having \nreceived 5 or more courses. The safety information collected during post-marketing experience \nreflects the expected adverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for rituximab (see section 4.4). \n\n \nPatients received 2 x 1,000 mg of rituximab separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to \nmethotrexate (10-25 mg/week). Rituximab infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion \nof 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nFrequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100) and very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of rituximab were IRRs. The overall \nincidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent \ninfusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during \nthe initial course. In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for rituximab, \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like \nreaction have been reported during post marketing experience. \n \nTable 2 Summary of adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials or during post \n\nmarketing surveillance occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving \nrituximab \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nupper respiratory \ntract infection, \nurinary tract \ninfections \n\nbronchitis, \nsinusitis, \ngastroenteritis, \ntinea pedis \n\n  PML, \nreactivation of \nhepatitis B \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n neutropenia1  late neutropenia2 serum sickness- \nlike reaction \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n3infusion related \nreactions \n(hypertension, \nnausea, rash, \n\n 3infusion related \nreactions \n(generalised \noedema, \n\n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n49  \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\npyrexia, pruritus, \nurticaria, throat \nirritation, hot \nflush, \nhypotension, \nrhinitis, rigors, \ntachycardia, \nfatigue, \noropharyngeal \npain, peripheral \noedema, \nerythma) \n\n bronchospasm, \nwheezing, \nlaryngeal \noedema, \nangioneurotic \noedema, \ngeneralised \npruritis, \nanaphylaxis, \nanaphylactoid \nreaction) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutritional \nDisorders \n\n hypercholesterole\nmia \n\n   \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n depression, \nanxiety \n\n   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache paraesthesia, \nmigraine, \ndizziness, sciatica \n\n   \n\nCardiac disorders    angina pectoris, \natrial fibrillation, \nheart failure, \nmyocardial \ninfarction \n\natrial flutter \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n dyspepsia, \ndiarrhoea, gastro-\noesophageal \nreflux, mouth \nulceration, upper \nabdominal pain \n\n   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n alopecia   toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nSyndrome), \nStevens-Johnson \nSyndrome5 \n\nMusculo-\nskeletal \ndisorders \n\n arthralgia / \nmusculoskeletal \npain, \nosteoarthritis, \nbursitis \n\n   \n\nInvestigations decreased IgM \nlevels4 \n\ndecreased IgG \nlevels4 \n\n   \n\n1 Frequency category derived from laboratory values collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring in clinical trials \n2 Frequency category derived from post-marketing data. \n3 Reactions occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion.

The rate of all ADRs following first rituximab exposure was highest during the first \n6 months and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the \nfirst treatment course), RA exacerbation and infections all of which were more frequent in the first \n6 months of treatment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n50  \n\n \nInfusion-related reactions \nThe most frequent ADRs following receipt of rituximab in clinical studies were IRRs. Among the \n3189 patients treated with rituximab, 1,135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR with \n733/3,189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to \nrituximab. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than 1% \n(17/3189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no deaths \ndue to IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events, and of IRRs leading to \nwithdrawal decreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with \nintravenous glucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the postmarketing setting. \n \nIn a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid rituximab infusion in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious \nIRR during or within 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour \nintravenous infusion of rituximab. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic \ntherapy for RA were excluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent \nwith that observed historically. No serious IRRs were observed. \n \nInfections \nThe overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in rituximab treated \npatients. The infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper \nrespiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious \nor required IV antibiotics, was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections \ndid not show any significant increase following multiple courses of rituximab. Lower respiratory \ntract infections (including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence \nin the rituximab-arms compared to control arms. \n \nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid \narthritis and off-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and \nvasculitis. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). \nReactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients \nreceiving rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nSerious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the rituximab treated \npatients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients \nexperiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n\n \nNeutropenia \nEvents of neutropenia were observed with rituximab treatment, the majority of which were \ntransient and mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the \nadministration of rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nIn placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1382) of rituximab treated patients and \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n51  \n\n0.27% (2/731) of placebo-treated patients developed severe neutropenia. \n \nNeutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported \nin the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA \npatients treated with rituximab. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections \nafter the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \nin paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nSummary of the Safety Profile (granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis) \n \nIn the clinical trial in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangitis, 99 patients were \ntreated with rituximab (375 mg/m2, once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe ADRs listed in Table 3 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% in the \nrituximab group. \n \nTable 3 Adverse drug reactions occurring at 6-months in ≥ 5% of patients receiving \n\nrituximab, and at a higher frequency than the comparator group, in the \npivotal clinical study. \n\nBody system \nAdverse reaction \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nInfections and infestations \nUrinary tract infection 7% \nBronchitis 5% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nNasopharyngitis 5% \n\nBlood and lymphatic  \nsystem disorders \n\nThrombocytopenia 7% \nImmune system disorders \n\nCytokine release syndrome 5% \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHyperkalaemia 5% \nPsychiatric disorders \n\nInsomnia 14% \nNervous system disorders \n\nDizziness 10% \nTremor 10% \n\nVascular disorders \nHypertension 12% \nFlushing 5% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n52  \n\nBody system \nAdverse reaction \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and  \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough 12% \nDyspnoea 11% \nEpistaxis 11% \nNasal congestion 6% \n\nGastrointestinal  \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea 18% \nDyspepsia 6% \nConstipation 5% \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \ntissue disorders \n\nAcne 7% \nMusculoskeletal and connective  \ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms 18% \nArthralgia 15% \nBack pain 10% \nMuscle weakness 5% \nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nPain in extremities 5% \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site conditions \n\nPeripheral oedema 16% \nInvestigations \n\nDecreased haemoglobin 6% \n \nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n \nInfusion related reactions \nIRRs in the GPA and MPA clinical trial were defined as any adverse event occurring within 24 \nhours of an infusion and considered to be infusion-related by investigators in the safety population. \nNinety nine patients were treated with rituximab and 12% experienced at least one IRR. All IRRs \nwere CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs included cytokine release syndrome, flushing, \nthroat irritation, and tremor. Rituximab was given in combination with intravenous glucocorticoids \nwhich may reduce the incidence and severity of these events. \n \nInfections \nIn the 99 rituximab patients, the overall rate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years \n(95% CI 197-285) at the 6-month primary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate \nand consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. \n \nThe rate of serious infections was approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently \nreported serious infection in the rituximab group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%. \n \nMalignancies \nThe incidence of malignancy in rituximab treated patients in the granulomatosis with polyangiitis and \nmicroscopic polyangiitis clinical study was 2.00 per 100 patient years at the study common closing \ndate (when the final patient had completed the follow-up period). On the basis of standardised \nincidence ratios, the incidence of malignancies appears to be similar to that previously reported in \npatients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53  \n\n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately 273 per 100 patient years (95% CI 149-470) at the \n6-month primary endpoint. The rate of serious cardiac events was 2.1 per 100 patient years (95% CI \n3-15). The most frequently reported events were tachycardia (4%) and atrial fibrillation (3%) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and \nsymptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without \nassociated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The \nreported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, \nhypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nA small number of cases of hepatitis B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab in the post-\nmarketing setting. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients treated with rituximab. At 6 \nmonths, in the active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial, in the \nrituximab group, 27%, 58% and 51% of patients with normal immunoglobulin levels at baseline, had \nlow IgA, IgG and IgM levels, respectively compared to 25%, 50% and 46% in the \ncyclophosphamide group. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections in \npatients with low IgA, IgG or IgM. \n \nNeutropenia \nIn the active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial of rituximab in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, 24% of patients in the rituximab \ngroup (single course) and 23% of patients in the cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or \ngreater neutropenia. Neutropenia was not associated with an observed increase in serious infection in \nrituximab-treated patients. The effect of multiple rituximab courses on the development of \nneutropenia in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients has not been \nstudied in clinical trials. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous rituximab formulation \nis available from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of rituximab tested in \nhumans to date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No \nadditional safety signals were identified. \n \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54  \n\nmonitored. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting five cases of rituximab overdose have been reported. Three cases had \nno reported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with \na dose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC02  \n \nRituzena is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on >95 % of \nall B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. \n \nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, \npro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalize \nupon antibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the \nplasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n \nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on \nthe surface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B \nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n \nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. \nIn patients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of \ntreatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, \nalthough in some patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months \npost-induction therapy). In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic \npolyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells decreased to <10 cells/μL after two weekly \ninfusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that level in most patients up to the 6 month time \npoint. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, with counts >10 cells/μL by \nmonth 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. \n \nClinical experience in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nFollicular lymphoma \n \nMonotherapy \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL \nreceived 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall \nresponse rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48 % (CI95% 41% - 56%) with a 6% \ncomplete response (CR) and a 42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to \nprogression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was \nhigher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58% \nvs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was < 5 cm vs. > 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. \n38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55  \n\nduration of response < 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with \nautologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. \nNeither age, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence or absence of bulky disease, normal or \nhigh LDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher’s exact test) \non response to rituximab. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response rates and \nbone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded compared to \n59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not supported by a \nstepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as prognostic \nfactors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and bulky \ndisease. \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 8 doses \nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The \nORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% – 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected \nmedian TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). \n \nInitial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses \nIn pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single \nlesion ≥ 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as \nintravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36 % (CI95% 21% – 51%; CR 3%, PR \n33%) with a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). \n \nRe-treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of rituximab, were \nre-treated with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the \npatients had received two courses of rituximab before enrolment and thus were given a third course \nin the study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the \nORR was 38% (CI95 % 26% – 51%; 10% CR, 28% PR) with a projected median TTP for \nresponding patients of 17.8 months (range 5.4 – 26.6). This compares favourably with the TTP \nachieved after the prior course of rituximab (12.4 months). \n \nInitial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy \n \nIn an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular \nlymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, \nvincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on \ndays 1 -5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or rituximab 375 mg/m2 in combination with CVP (R-\nCVP). Rituximab was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 \npatients (162 R-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median \nfollow up of patients was 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the \nprimary endpoint, time to treatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p < 0.0001, log-rank test). \nThe proportion of patients with a tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p< \n0.0001 Chi-Square test) in the R-CVP group (80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment \nwith R-CVP significantly prolonged the time  to disease progression or death compared to CVP, \n33.6 months and 14.7 months, respectively (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of \nresponse was 37.7 months in the R-CVP group and was 13.5 months in the CVP group (p < \n0.0001, log-rank test). \n \nThe difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant \nclinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were \n80.9% for patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1 % for patients in the CVP group．  \n \nResults from three other randomised trials using rituximab in combination with chemotherapy \nregimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferon-α) have also demonstrated significant \nimprovements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival.

In all patients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β2 \nmicroglobulin, LDH, albumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow \ninvolvement), the risk ratios for event-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with \nCHOP) were less than 0.83 and 0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in \noutcome for both high- and low-risk patients according to age adjusted IPI. \n \nClinical laboratory findings \n \nOf 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of \n356 patients evaluated for HACA, 1.1 % (4 patients) were positive. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nIn two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients \nwith relapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 \nmg/m2, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or rituximab in \ncombination with FC (R-FC). Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m2 during the first \ncycle one day prior to chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each subsequent \ntreatment cycle. Patients were excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had \npreviously been treated with monoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to \nachieve a partial remission for at least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total \nof 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 FC) for the first-line study (Table 5a and Table 5b) and 552 patients \n(276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the relapsed/refractory study (Table 6) were analysed for efficacy. \n \nIn the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 \nmonths in the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of \noverall survival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone (p = \n0.0319, log-rank test) (Table 5a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most \npatient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 5b). \n \nTable 5a First-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nOverview of efficacy results for rituximab plus FC vs. FC alone - 48.1 months \nmedian observation time \n\nEfficacy parameter Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time \nto event (months) \n\nRisk \nreduction \n\nFC \n(N = 409) \n\nR-FC \n(N=408) \n\nLog-rank \np value \n\nProgression‐free survival (PFS) 32.8 55.3 <0.0001 45% \nOverall survival NR NR 0.0319 27% \nEvent free survival 31.3 51.8 <0.0001 44% \nResponse rate (CR, nPR, or PR) \nCR rates \n\n72.6% \n16.9% \n\n85.8% \n36.0% \n\n<0.0001 \n<0.0001 \n\nn.a. \nn.a. \n\nDuration of response* 36.2 57.3 <0.0001 44% \nDisease free survival (DFS)** 48.9 60.3 0.0520 31% \nTime to new treatment 47.2 69.7 <0.0001 42% \n\nResponse rate and CR rates analysed using Chi-squared Test.

See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \nClinical experience in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nA total of 197 patients aged 15 years or older with severely, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n59  \n\n(75%) and microscopic polyangiitis (24%) were enrolled and treated in an active-comparator, \nrandomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial. \n \nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral cyclophosphamide daily (2mg/kg/day) \nfor 3-6 months or rituximab (375 mg/m2) once weekly for 4 weeks. All patients in the \ncyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy during follow-up. Patients in both \narms received 1000mg of pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose \nglucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 \nmg/day). Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of study treatment. \n \nThe primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a \nBirmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener’s granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off \nglucocorticoid therapy. The prespecified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was 20%. \nThe trial demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete remission \n(CR) at 6 months (Table 7). \n \nEfficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing \ndisease (Table 8). \n\n \nTable 7 Percentage of patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months \n\n(Intent-to-treat population*) \n \n\nRituximab \n(n = 99) \n\nCyclophosphamide \n(n = 98) \n\nTreatment difference \n(Rituximab \n\n--cyclophosphamide) \n\nRate 63.6% 53.1% \n10.6% \n\n95.1%b CI \n(−3.2%, 24.3%) a \n\n– CI = confidence interval. \n– * Worst case imputation \na Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound (−3.2%) was higher than the pre-determined  \n\nnon-inferiority margin ( − 20%). \nb The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy analysis. \n\n \nTable 8 Complete remission at 6-months by disease status \n Rituximab Cyclophosphamide Difference (CI 95%) \nAll patients \nNewly \ndiagnosed \n\n \n\nn=99 \nn=48 \nn=51 \n\nn=98 \nn=48 \nn=50 \n\n \n\nComplete remission \nAll Patients 63.6% 53.1% 10.6% (‐3.2, 24.3) \nNewly diagnosed 60.4% 64.6% − 4.2% (− 23.6, 15.3) \nRelapsing 66.7% 42.0% 24.7% (5.8, 43.6) \n\nWorst case imputation is applied for patients with missing data \n \nComplete remission at 12 and 18 months \nIn the rituximab group, 48% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 39% of patients achieved \nCR at 18 months. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine for \nmaintenance of complete remission), 39% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 33% of \npatients achieved CR at 18 months. From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the \nrituximab group compared with four in the cyclophosphamide group. \n \nRetreatment with rituximab \nBased upon investigator judgment, 15 patients received a second course of rituximab therapy for \ntreatment of relapse of disease activity which occurred between 6 and 18 months after the first \ncourse of rituximab. The limited data from the present trial preclude any conclusions regarding the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n60  \n\nefficacy of subsequent courses of rituximab in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and \nmicroscopic polyangiitis. \n \nContinued immunosuppressive therapy may be especially appropriate in patients at risk for relapses \n(i.e. with history of earlier relapses and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or patients with \nreconstitution of B-lymphocytes in addition to PR3-ANCA at monitoring). When remission with \nrituximab has been achieved, continued immunosuppressive therapy may be considered to prevent \nrelapse. The efficacy and safety of rituximab in maintenance therapy has not been established. \n\n \nLaboratory evaluations \n \nA total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated patients in the trial tested positive for HACA by 18 months. \nNone of the 99 rituximab-treated patients were HACA positive at screening. The clinical relevance of \nHACA formation in rituximab-treated patients is unclear. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or \nmultiple infusions of rituximab as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied \nrituximab doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m2), the typical population estimates of nonspecific \nclearance (CL1), specific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and \ncentral compartment volume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/day, 0.59 L/day, and 2.7 L, \nrespectively. The estimated median terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22 days (range, \n6.1 to 52 days). Baseline CD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions \ncontributed to some of the variability in CL2 of rituximab in data from 161 patients given 375 \nmg/m2 as an intravenous infusion for 4  weekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell \ncounts or tumour lesions had a higher CL2. However, a large component of inter-individual \nvariability remained for CL2 after correction for CD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. \nV1 varied by body surface area (BSA) and CHOP therapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) \ncontributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m2) and concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were \nrelatively small. Age, gender and WHO performance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nrituximab. This analysis suggests that dose adjustment of rituximab with any of the tested covariates \nis not expected to result in a meaningful reduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. \n \nRituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at weekly intervals for 4 \ndoses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth \ninfusion of 486 µg/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of \npatients 3 – 6 months after completion of last treatment. \n \nUpon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly \nintervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive \ninfusion, spanning from a mean of 243 µg/mL (range, 16 – 582 µg/mL) after the first infusion to 550 \nµg/mL (range, 171 – 1177 µg/mL) after the eighth infusion. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in \ncombination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nRituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m2 increased \nto 500 mg/m2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL \npatients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 µg/mL (range, 97 – 764 µg/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/ \nm2 infusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 – 62 days). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n61  \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nFollowing two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean \nterminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day \n(range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to 7.51 \nL). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic \nclearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis \nrevealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual \nvariability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger volume \nof distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender- related pharmacokinetic \ndifferences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not required. No \npharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous (IV) doses of 500 mg \nand 1000 mg on Days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were \ndose proportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first \ninfusion ranged from 157 to 171 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 µg/mL for 2 \nx 1000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 µg/mL for the2 x \n500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 µg/mL for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination \nhalf-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 x 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for the 2 x 1000 \nmg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared to the first \ninfusion for both doses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two IV doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg \nupon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion was \n170 to 175 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 µg/mL for 2 x 1000 mg dose. Cmax following \nsecond infusion, was 207 µg/mL for the 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 377 to 386 µg/mL for the 2 \nx 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second infusion, following the second \ncourse, was 19 days for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. \nPK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment courses. \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the \nsame dosage regimen (2 x 1000 mg, IV, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum serum \nconcentration of 369 µg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m2 rituximab once weekly for four \ndoses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 to 49 days). \nRituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 to 0.726 \nL/day) and 4.50 L (range 2.25 to 7.39 L) respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in these \npatients appear similar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion \nof B cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the \nfoetus due to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the \nlymphoid organs of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied \nby a decrease in IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these \nanimals within 6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n62  \n\nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \nfor this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic \npotential of rituximab.  \n\n \nSpecific studies to determine the effects of rituximab on fertility have not been performed. In general \ntoxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive organs in males or \nfemales were observed. \n \n \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Rituzena is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Rituzena \n3. How to use Rituzena \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rituzena \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n1. What Rituzena is and what it is used for  \n \nWhat Rituzena is \nRituzena contains the active substance “rituximab”. This is a type of protein called a “monoclonal \nantibody”. It is designed to stick to a type of white blood cell called “B-Lymphocyte”. When \nsticking to the surface of this cell, rituximab causes the cell to die. \n \nWhat Rituzena is used for \nRituzena may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults. Your doctor may \nprescribe Rituzena for the treatment of: \n \na) Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \nThis is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects B-Lymphocytes. \nRituzena can be given alone or with other medicines called “chemotherapy”. \n \nb) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects \nB-lymphocytes, which originate in the bone marrow and develop in the lymph nodes. Patients with \nCLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone marrow and blood. \nThe spread of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you may have. Rituzena in \ncombination with chemotherapy destroys these cells. \n \nc) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nRituzena is used for inducing remission in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called \nWegener’s granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids. \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the \nblood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. \nB-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rituzena  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n80  \n\nDo not take Rituzena if: \n• you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• you have a severe active infection at the moment \n• you have a weak immune system \n• you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have granulomatosis with \n\npolyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis. \n \nDo not have Rituzena if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena if: \n \n• you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nRituzena could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \nsigns of this infection. \n\n• you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \nproblems. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given Rituzena. Your doctor may need to take special care during your treatment with \nRituzena. \n \nIf you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis also tell your doctor \n• if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected \n\nby Rituzena help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you \nare given Rituzena. Also please tell your doctor if you have had a lot of infections in the past or \nsuffer from severe infections. \n\n• if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations for travel \nto other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Rituzena or in the \nmonths after you receive Rituzena. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines \nbefore you receive Rituzena. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, \nare under 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of Rituzena \nin children and young people. \n\n \nOther medicines and Rituzena \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause Rituzena can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way Rituzena works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n• if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given Rituzena. This is because some people have a fall in \ntheir blood pressure while they are being given Rituzena. \n\n• if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or \nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given Rituzena. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n81  \n\nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant. This is because Rituzena can transfer across the placenta and may \naffect your baby. \nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception \nwhile using Rituzena. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with \nRituzena. \nDo not breast-feed while you are being treated with Rituzena. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months \nafter your last treatment with Rituzena. This is because Rituzena may pass into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether Rituzena has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or \nmachines. \n \n \n3. How Rituzena is given  \n \nHow it is given \nRituzena will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any \nside effects. \nYou will always be given Rituzena as a drip (intravenous infusion). \n \nMedicines given before each Rituzena administration \nBefore you are given Rituzena, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or \nreduce possible side effects. \n \nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n \na) If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \n• If you are having Rituzena alone \n\nRituzena will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses \nwith Rituzena are possible. \n\n• If you are having Rituzena with chemotherapy \nRituzena will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given \n\nevery 3 weeks up to 8 times. \n \nb) If you are being treated for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \nWhen you are treated with Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy, you will receive Rituzena \nevery 28 days until you have received 6 doses. The chemotherapy should be given after the Rituzena \ninfusion. Your doctor will decide if you should receive other treatment at the same time. \n \n \nc) If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis  \nTreatment with Rituzena uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. A corticosteroid \nmedicine will usually be given by injection before the start of Rituzena treatment. Corticosteroid \nmedicine given by mouth may be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of \nthese reactions have been fatal. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n82  \n\nInfusion reactions \nDuring or within the first 2 hours of the first infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. \nLess frequently, some patients may get pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness, tiredness, \nheadache, breathing difficulties, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing \nor palpitations, heart attack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these \ninfusion reactions might get worse. Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you \ndevelop any of these symptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may \nrequire additional treatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go \naway, or improve, the infusion can be continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the \nsecond infusion. Your doctor may decide to stop your Rituzena treatment if these reactions are \nserious. \n \nInfections \nTell your doctor immediately if you get signs of an infection including: \n \n• fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell \n• memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, \n\nserious brain infection, which has been fatal (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or \nPML). \n\nYou might get infections more easily during your treatment with Rituzena. \nThese are often colds, but there have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections.

What Rituzena is and what it is used for  \n \nWhat Rituzena is \nRituzena contains the active substance “rituximab”. This is a type of protein called a “monoclonal \nantibody”. It is designed to stick to a type of white blood cell called “B-Lymphocyte”. When \nsticking to the surface of this cell, rituximab causes the cell to die. \n \nWhat Rituzena is used for \nRituzena may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults. Your doctor may \nprescribe Rituzena for the treatment of: \n \nd) Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \nThis is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects B-Lymphocytes. \nRituzena can be given alone or with other medicines called “chemotherapy”. \n \ne) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects \nB-lymphocytes, which originate in the bone marrow and develop in the lymph nodes. Patients with \nCLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone marrow and blood. \nThe spread of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you may have. Rituzena in \ncombination with chemotherapy destroys these cells. \n \nf) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nRituzena is used for inducing remission in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called \nWegener’s granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids. \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the \nblood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. \nB-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n88  \n\n \n \n8. What you need to know before you use Rituzena  \n\n \nDo not take Rituzena if: \n• you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• you have a severe active infection at the moment \n• you have a weak immune system \n• you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have granulomatosis with \n\npolyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis. \n \nDo not have Rituzena if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena if: \n \n• you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nRituzena could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \nsigns of this infection. \n\n• you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \nproblems. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given Rituzena. Your doctor may need to take special care during your treatment with \nRituzena. \n \nIf you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis also tell your doctor \n• if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected \n\nby Rituzena help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you \nare given Rituzena. Also please tell your doctor if you have had a lot of infections in the past or \nsuffer from severe infections. \n\n• if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations for travel \nto other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Rituzena or in the \nmonths after you receive Rituzena. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines \nbefore you receive Rituzena. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, \nare under 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of Rituzena \nin children and young people. \n\n \nOther medicines and Rituzena \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause Rituzena can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way Rituzena works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n• if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given Rituzena. This is because some people have a fall in \ntheir blood pressure while they are being given Rituzena. \n\n• if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or \nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n89  \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given Rituzena. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant. This is because Rituzena can transfer across the placenta and may \naffect your baby. \nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception \nwhile using Rituzena. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with \nRituzena. \nDo not breast-feed while you are being treated with Rituzena. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months \nafter your last treatment with Rituzena. This is because Rituzena may pass into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether Rituzena has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or \nmachines. \n \n \n9. How Rituzena is given  \n \nHow it is given \nRituzena will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any \nside effects. \nYou will always be given Rituzena as a drip (intravenous infusion). \n \nMedicines given before each Rituzena administration \nBefore you are given Rituzena, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or \nreduce possible side effects. \n \nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n \nd) If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \n• If you are having Rituzena alone \n\nRituzena will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses \nwith Rituzena are possible. \n\n• If you are having Rituzena with chemotherapy \nRituzena will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given \n\nevery 3 weeks up to 8 times. \n \ne) If you are being treated for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \nWhen you are treated with Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy, you will receive Rituzena \nevery 28 days until you have received 6 doses. The chemotherapy should be given after the Rituzena \ninfusion. Your doctor will decide if you should receive other treatment at the same time. \n \n \nf) If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis  \nTreatment with Rituzena uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. A corticosteroid \nmedicine will usually be given by injection before the start of Rituzena treatment. Corticosteroid \nmedicine given by mouth may be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n10. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n90  \n\n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of \nthese reactions have been fatal. \n \nInfusion reactions \nDuring or within the first 2 hours of the first infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. \nLess frequently, some patients may get pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness, tiredness, \nheadache, breathing difficulties, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing \nor palpitations, heart attack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these \ninfusion reactions might get worse. Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you \ndevelop any of these symptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may \nrequire additional treatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go \naway, or improve, the infusion can be continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the \nsecond infusion. Your doctor may decide to stop your Rituzena treatment if these reactions are \nserious. \n \nInfections \nTell your doctor immediately if you get signs of an infection including: \n \n• fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell \n• memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, \n\nserious brain infection, which has been fatal (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or \nPML). \n\nYou might get infections more easily during your treatment with Rituzena. \nThese are often colds, but there have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections. These are \nlisted below under “Other side effects”. \n \nSkin reactions \nVery rarely, severe blistering skin conditions that can be life-threatening may occur. Redness, often \nassociated with blisters, may appear on the skin or on mucous membranes, such as inside the mouth, \nthe genital areas or the eyelids, and fever may be present.
