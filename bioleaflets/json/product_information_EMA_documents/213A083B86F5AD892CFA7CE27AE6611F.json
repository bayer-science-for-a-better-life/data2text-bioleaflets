NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 250 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 50 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until \npain and acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) until adequate wound healing, \nthen continue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from \nadult patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight \n3 to 4 times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \n\n\n\n7 \n\nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis \nwas maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance \nrates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays \nperformed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative. \n\nc) ADR explained in the section below. \nd) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process \nOf the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nprotein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or \ntransient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5.

ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a \nsub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to \na specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval \nof 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± \n438.6 \n\n1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted Incremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young \nchildren (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma \nvolume per kilogram body weight in younger patients. \n \nPharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute \ntoxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 100 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until \npain and acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) until adequate wound healing, \nthen continue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \n\n\n\n18 \n\nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis \nwas maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance \nrates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays \nperformed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative. \n\nc) ADR explained in the section below. \nd) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process \nOf the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nprotein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or \ntransient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19 \n\nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within \na sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to \na specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval \nof 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC (IU*·h/dl) 1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± \n438.6 \n\n1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted Incremental \nRecovery at Cmax (IU/dL \nper IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence Time (h) 11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \nVolume of Distribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 1000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 200 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain \nand acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until adequate wound healing, then \ncontinue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \n\n\n\n29 \n\nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis \nwas maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance \nrates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays \nperformed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative. \n\nc) ADR explained in the section below. \nd) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process \nOf the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nprotein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or \ntransient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n\nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a \nsub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to \na specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval \nof 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± 438.6 1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted \nIncremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 1500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 1500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 300 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clea and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until \npain and acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) until adequate wound healing, \nthen continue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \n\n\n\n40 \n\nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis \nwas maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance \nrates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays \nperformed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative. \n\nc) ADR explained in the section below. \nd) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process \nOf the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nprotein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or \ntransient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n41 \n\nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a \nsub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to \na specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval \nof 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants \n(1 month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± 438.6 1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted \nIncremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 2000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 400 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until \npain and acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the \nage of 6) until adequate wound healing, \nthen continue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \n\n\n\n51 \n\nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis \nwas maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance \nrates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays \nperformed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative. \n\nc) ADR explained in the section below. \nd) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process \nOf the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nprotein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or \ntransient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n52 \n\nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within \na sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a \nspecific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of \n72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± 438.6 1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted \nIncremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young \nchildren (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma \nvolume per kilogram body weight in younger patients. \n \nPharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute \ntoxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 3000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 600 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain \nand acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until adequate wound healing, then \ncontinue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \n\n\n\n62 \n\nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis \nwas maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance \nrates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays \nperformed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative. \n\nc) ADR explained in the section below. \nd) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process \nOf the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nprotein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or \ntransient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n63 \n\nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a \nsub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a \nspecific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of \n72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± 438.6 1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted \nIncremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 250 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 125 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife-threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain \nand acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until adequate wound healing, then \ncontinue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nDue to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for \ninjections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. \nTherefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for \ninjections, especially in children. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \n\n\n\n71 \n\nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nMisapplication of ADVATE \nFor ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or \nparavenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema. \n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \n\n\n\n72 \n\nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n74 \n\nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a \nsub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.  \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a \nspecific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of \n72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± 311.8 1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± \n438.6 \n\n1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted \nIncremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \n\n\n\n75 \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± 30.2 90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young \nchildren (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma \nvolume per kilogram body weight in younger patients. \n \nPharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute \ntoxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nA local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for \ninjections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the \nadministration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. \nHowever, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient \nnature of this finding. \n \n \n6.

Do not remove the blue cap \nfrom the BAXJECT II device. \n\n7. For reconstitution only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device provided \nin the pack should be used. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so \nthat the solvent vial is on top of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the ADVATE \npowder stopper. The vacuum will draw the solvent into the ADVATE powder vial (Fig. c). \n\n8. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely \ndissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The \nproduct dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should \nbe clear, colourless and free from foreign particles. \n\n \nFig. a        Fig. b          Fig. c \n \n\n \n \nReconstitution with the BAXJECT III system \n- Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister \n \n1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent \n\nvials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room \ntemperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). \n\n2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n3. Open the ADVATE package by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from \n\nthe blister. \n4. Place the ADVATE on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Fig. 1). The solvent vial has a \n\nblue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step. \n5. With one hand holding the ADVATE in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the \n\nsolvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down \ninto the ADVATE vial (Fig. 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete. \n\n6. Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure \nthat the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will \npass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). \nAfter reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles. \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nFig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 \n\n   \n \nAdministration \nUse Aseptic Technique \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected for particulate matter prior to administration, \nwhenever solution and container permit. Only a clear and colourless solution should be used. \n \n1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II / BAXJECT III. Do not draw air into the syringe. \n\nConnect the syringe to BAXJECT II / BAXJECT III. \n2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the \n\nreconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly. \n3. Disconnect the syringe. \n4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe. Inject intravenously. The solution should be \n\nadministered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient’s comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml \nper minute. The pulse rate should be determined before and during administration of ADVATE. \nShould a significant increase occur, reducing the rate of administration or temporarily \ninterrupting the injection usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 250 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain \nand acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until adequate wound healing, then \ncontinue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nDue to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for \ninjections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. \nTherefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for \ninjections, especially in children. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \n\n\n\n82 \n\nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nMisapplication of ADVATE \nFor ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or \nparavenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema. \n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \n\n\n\n83 \n\nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\n\n\n84 \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \n\ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14).

Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n85 \n\nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within \na sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a \nspecific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of \n72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± 438.6 1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted \nIncremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\n\n\n86 \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young \nchildren (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma \nvolume per kilogram body weight in younger patients. \n \nPharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute \ntoxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nA local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for \ninjections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the \nadministration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. \nHowever, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient \nnature of this finding. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 1000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 500 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n91 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain \nand acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until adequate wound healing, then \ncontinue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \n\nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nDue to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for \ninjections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. \nTherefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for \ninjections, especially in children. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \n\n\n\n93 \n\nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nMisapplication of ADVATE \nFor ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or \nparavenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema. \n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \n\n\n\n94 \n\nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\n\n\n95 \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \n\ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14).

Factor VIII inhibitor assays \nperformed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative. \n\nc) ADR explained in the section below. \nd) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process \nOf the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nprotein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or \ntransient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n96 \n\nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a \nsub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a \nspecific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of \n72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± 438.6 1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted Incremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\n\n\n97 \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at Steady \nState (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal \n\npost-infusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young \nchildren (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma \nvolume per kilogram body weight in younger patients. \n \nPharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute \ntoxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nA local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for \ninjections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the \nadministration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. \nHowever, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient \nnature of this finding. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nADVATE 1500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 1500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE \ncontains approximately 750 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after \nreconstitution. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic \nassay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/mg protein. \nOctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared \nwithout the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, \npurification or final formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the \nWHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a \npercentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for \nfactor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor \nVIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/type \nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n \n \n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma. \n \n \n \nLife threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n \n20 – 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n \n60 – 100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for at least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode, as indicated by pain, \nis resolved or healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain \nand acute disability are resolved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nIncluding tooth extraction. \n \n \nMajor \n \n\n \n \n30 – 60 \n \n \n \n80 – 100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for \npatients under the age of 6), at \nleast 1 day, until healing is achieved. \n \nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age \nof 6) until adequate wound healing, then \ncontinue therapy for at least \nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual \ncase. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those \ncalculated using the formula may be necessary. \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma \nfactor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nVIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. \n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses \nare 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. \n \n\n\n\n103 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult \npatients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 \ntimes weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy. \n \nMethod of administration \nADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health \ncare professional appropriate training is needed. \n \nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \nof 10 ml/min. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \nof 6.7 to 7.3. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or \n\nhamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. \nThe product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nDue to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for \ninjections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. \nTherefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for \ninjections, especially in children. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \n\n\n\n104 \n\nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nMisapplication of ADVATE \nFor ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or \nparavenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema. \n \nCatheter-related complications in treatment \nIf central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nClinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE \nreporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency \nwere development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever. \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions \nmay be observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \n\n\n\n105 \n\nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from \nspontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInfections and infestations Influenza Uncommon \nLaryngitis Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)d \nVery common (PUPs)d \n\n \nLymphangitis Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known \nHypersensitivityc Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nDizziness Uncommon \nMemory impairment Uncommon \nSyncope Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon \nDysgeusia Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Eye inflammation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nHot flush Uncommon \nPallor Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal pain upper Uncommon \nNausea Uncommon \nVomiting Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nHyperhidrosis Uncommon \nUrticaria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \nPeripheral oedema Uncommon \nChest pain Uncommon \nChest discomfort Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \nFeeling abnormal Uncommon \nVessel puncture site haematoma Uncommon \nFatigue Not known \nInjection site reaction Not known \nMalaise Not known \n\nInvestigations Monocyte Count increased Uncommon \nCoagulation factor VIII level \ndecreasedb \n\nUncommon \n\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon \nLaboratory test abnormal Uncommon \n\n\n\n106 \n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials and from spontaneous reports \nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequencya \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Post procedural complication Uncommon \nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon \nProcedural site reaction Uncommon \n\n \na) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418). \nb) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during \n\ncontinuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis \nwas maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance \nrates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays \nperformed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative. \n\nc) ADR explained in the section below. \nd) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process \nOf the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nprotein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or \ntransient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who \nwere assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward \ntrend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients \nreported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst \nrepeated exposures to the study product. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, \nflushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus. \n \nPaediatric population \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant \ncoagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII \nglycoprotein found in human plasma. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n107 \n\nOctocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass \nof 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand \nFactor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, \naccelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts \nprothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are \nincreased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a \nsub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart \nreview was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective \nregistry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed \nITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. \n \nIn study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an \nindividualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII \nper kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen \n(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a \nspecific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of \n72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are \ncomparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) in \"Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor \nVIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII\" and \"treatment and prophylaxis of \nbleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)\". (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nto moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was \nconducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay. \n \nA total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters \nthat were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 \nmonth to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), \nadolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize \nPK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion. \n \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nTotal AUC \n(IU*·h/dl) \n\n1362.1 ± \n311.8 \n\n1180.0 ± \n432.7 \n\n1506.6 ± 530.0 1317.1 ± 438.6 1538.5 ± 519.1 \n\nAdjusted \nIncremental \nRecovery at Cmax \n(IU/dL per IU/kg)a \n\n2.2 ± 0.6 1.8 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.5 2.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.6 \n\nHalf-life (h) 9.0 ± 1.5 9.6 ± 1.7 11.8 ± 3.8 12.1 ± 3.2 12.9 ± 4.3 \n\n\n\n108 \n\nTable 3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of ADVATE per Age Group with severe haemophilia A \n(baseline factor VIII < 1%) \n\nParameter (mean ± \nstandard deviation) \n\nInfants \n(n=5) \n\nChildren \n(n=30) \n\nOlder Children \n(n=18) \n\nAdolescents \n(n=33) \n\nAdults \n(n=109) \n\nMaximum Plasma \nConcentration Post \nInfusion (IU/dl) \n\n110.5 ± \n30.2 \n\n90.8 ± 19.1 100.5 ± 25.6 107.6 ± 27.6 111.3 ± 27.1 \n\nMean Residence \nTime (h) \n\n11.0 ± 2.8 12.0 ± 2.7 15.1 ± 4.7 15.0 ± 5.0 16.2 ± 6.1 \n\nVolume of \nDistribution at \nSteady State (dl/kg) \n\n0.4 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.1 0.5 ± 0.2 0.6 ± 0.2 0.5 ± 0.2 \n\nClearance (ml/kg*h) 3.9 ± 0.9 4.8 ± 1.5 3.8 ± 1.5 4.1 ± 1.0 3.6 ± 1.2 \na Calculated as (Cmax - baseline Factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-\ninfusion Factor VIII measurement. \n \nThe safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of \nadult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young \nchildren (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma \nvolume per kilogram body weight in younger patients. \n \nPharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute \ntoxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nA local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for \ninjections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the \nadministration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. \nHowever, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient \nnature of this finding. \n \n \n6.

The end of the 6 months storage at room temperature should be recorded on the \nproduct carton. The product may not be returned to refrigerated storage again. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C). \nDo not freeze. \nADVATE with BAXJECT II device: Keep the product vial in the outer carton in order to protect from \nlight. \nADVATE in BAXJECT III system: Keep the sealed blister in the outer carton in order to protect from \nlight. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nBoth the powder vial and the vial containing 2 ml solvent are of type I glass closed with chlorobutyl \nrubber stoppers. The product is provided in one of the following configurations: \n \n- ADVATE with BAXJECT II device: Each pack contains a powder vial, a vial containing 2 ml \n\nsolvent and a device for reconstitution (BAXJECT II). \n- ADVATE in BAXJECT III system: Each pack contains a ready to use BAXJECT III system in \n\na sealed blister (the powder vial and the vial containing 2 ml solvent are preassembled with the \nsystem for reconstitution). \n\n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nADVATE is to be administered intravenously after reconstitution of the product. \nThe reconstituted solution should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or \ndiscoloration. \nAfter reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles. \nDo not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. \n \n- For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required. \n- Use within three hours after reconstitution. \n- Do not refrigerate the preparation after reconstitution. \n- Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n \nReconstitution with the BAXJECT II device \n- For reconstitution use only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device \n\nprovided in the pack. \n- Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or \n\nshows any sign of deterioration. \n- Aseptic Technique should be used \n \n\n\n\n110 \n\n1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take both the ADVATE powder and solvent vials \nfrom the refrigerator and let them reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). \n\n2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n3. Remove caps from powder and solvent vials. \n4. Cleanse stoppers with alcohol swabs. Place the vials on a flat clean surface. \n5. Open the package of BAXJECT II device by peeling away the paper lid without touching the \n\ninside (Fig. a). Do not remove the device from the package. Do not use if the BAXJECT II \ndevice, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or shows any sign of deterioration. \n\n6. Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the \npackage at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap \nfrom the BAXJECT II device. \n\n7. For reconstitution only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device provided \nin the pack should be used. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so \nthat the solvent vial is on top of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the ADVATE \npowder stopper. The vacuum will draw the solvent into the ADVATE powder vial (Fig. c). \n\n8. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely \ndissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The \nproduct dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should \nbe clear, colourless and free from foreign particles. \n\n \nFig. a        Fig. b          Fig. c \n \n\n \n \nReconstitution with the BAXJECT III system \n- Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister \n \n1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent \n\nvials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room \ntemperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). \n\n2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n3. Open the ADVATE package by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from \n\nthe blister. \n4. Place the ADVATE on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Fig. 1). The solvent vial has a \n\nblue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step. \n5. With one hand holding the ADVATE in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the \n\nsolvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down \ninto the ADVATE vial (Fig. 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete. \n\n6. Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure \nthat the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will \npass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). \nAfter reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles. \n\n \n\n\n\n111 \n\nFig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 \n\n   \n \nAdministration \nUse Aseptic Technique \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected for particulate matter prior to administration, \nwhenever solution and container permit. Only a clear and colourless solution should be used. \n \n1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II / BAXJECT III. Do not draw air into the syringe. \n\nConnect the syringe to BAXJECT II / BAXJECT III. \n2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the \n\nreconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly. \n3. Disconnect the syringe. \n4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe. Inject intravenously. The solution should be \n\nadministered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient’s comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml \nper minute. The pulse rate should be determined before and during administration of ADVATE. \nShould a significant increase occur, reducing the rate of administration or temporarily \ninterrupting the injection usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE \n3. How to use ADVATE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store ADVATE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for \n \nADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. \nIn patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. \n \nADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with \nhaemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). \n \nADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire \nmanufacturing process. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE \n \nDo not use ADVATE \n- if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins \n \nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously \ntreated with Factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher \nrisk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy \n\n\n\n219 \n\nof ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the \ntreatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nThere is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \nreaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, \nwheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in \nthe chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early \nsymptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme \ndizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing. \nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe \nsymptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. \n \nPatients developing Factor VIII inhibitors \nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \nall Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \nyou or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age). \n \nOther medicines and ADVATE \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nADVATE has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nADVATE contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken into consideration by patients \non a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to use ADVATE \n \nTreatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your \ncondition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The \nfrequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the \nreplacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nPrevention of bleeding \nThe usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. \nHowever, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may \nbe necessary. \n \n\n\n\n220 \n\nTreatment of bleeding \nThe dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n \nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5 \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor. \nYour doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII \nlevels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n \nUse in children and adolescents (from 0 to 18 years of age) \nFor the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the \nprevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to \n4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does \nnot differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become \nnecessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products. \n \nHow ADVATE is given \nADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else \nmight also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed \ninstructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. \n \nIf you use more ADVATE than you should \nAlways take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \nare not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to use ADVATE \nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as \nscheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n \nIf you stop using ADVATE \nDo not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped \nimmediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early \nsymptoms of allergic reactions: \n \n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n \nSevere symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency \ntreatment. \n \nFor children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) \nmay form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous \ntreatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 \n\n\n\n221 \n\npeople). If this happens your or your child’s medicines may stop working properly and you or your \nchild may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nFactor VIII inhibitors (for children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines).  \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nheadache and fever. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nFactor VIII inhibitors (for patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than \n150 days of treatment)), dizziness, flu, fainting, abnormal heartbeat, red itchy bumps on the skin, chest \ndiscomfort, injection site bruise, injection site reaction, itching, increased sweating, unusual taste in \nthe mouth, hot flushes, migraines, memory impairment, chills, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, shortness \nof breath, sore throat, infection of the lymphatic vessels, whitening of skin, eye inflammation, rashes, \nexcessive sweating, foot and leg swelling, reduced percentage of red blood cells, increase in a type of \nwhite blood cells (monocytes), and pain in the upper abdomen or lower chest. \n \nRelated to surgery \ncatheter-related infection, decreased red cell blood count, swelling of limbs and joints, prolonged \nbleeding after drain removal, decreased Factor VIII level and post-operative bruise. \n \nRelated to central venous access devices (CVAD) \ncatheter-related infection, systemic infection and local blood clot at the catheter site. \n \nSide effects with unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \npotentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis) and other allergic reactions (hypersensitivity), \ngeneral disorders (tiredness, lack of energy). \n \nAdditional side effects in children \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in side effects were noted in the clinical \nstudies. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless \nand free from foreign particles. \nEach pack also contains a device for reconstitution (BAXJECT II). \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder \nTakeda Manufacturing Austria AG \nIndustriestrasse 67 \nA-1221 Vienna \nTel: +800 66838470 \ne-mail: medinfoEMEA@shire.com \n \nManufacturer \nBaxalta Belgium Manufacturing SA \nBoulevard René Branquart 80 \nB-7860 Lessines \nBelgium \n \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/ \n \n \nInstructions for preparation and administration \n \nAseptic technique is required during preparation of the solution and administration. \n \nUse only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device for preparation of the solution \nthat are provided with each package of ADVATE. ADVATE must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts or solvents. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of \nthe product are recorded. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n223 \n\n \nInstructions for reconstitution \n• Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and carton. \n• Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or \n\nshows any sign of deterioration as indicated by the symbol: . \n• Do not refrigerate the solution after preparation. \n \n1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take both the ADVATE powder and solvent vials \n\nfrom the refrigerator and let them reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). \n2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n3. Remove caps from powder and solvent vials. \n4. Cleanse stoppers with alcohol swabs. Place the vials on a flat clean surface. \n5. Open the package of BAXJECT II device by peeling away the paper lid without touching the \n\ninside (Fig. a). Do not remove the device from the package. Do not use if the BAXJECT II \ndevice, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or shows any sign of deterioration. \n\n6. Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the \npackage at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap \nfrom the BAXJECT II device. \n\n7. For reconstitution only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device provided \nin the pack should be used. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so \nthat the solvent vial is on top of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the ADVATE \npowder stopper. The vacuum will draw the solvent into the ADVATE powder vial (Fig. c). \n\n8. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely \ndissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The \nproduct dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should \nbe clear, colourless and free from foreign particles. \n\n \nFig. a        Fig. b          Fig. c \n\n \n \nInstructions for injection \nFor administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required. \n \nImportant note: \n• Do not try to administer the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor \n\nor nurse. \n• Inspect the prepared solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the \n\nsolution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles). \nDo not use ADVATE if the solution is not fully clear or not completely dissolved. \n\n \n1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II. Do not draw air into the syringe. Connect the \n\nsyringe to BAXJECT II (Fig. d). \n2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the \n\nreconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Fig. e). \n3. Disconnect the syringe. \n\n\n\n224 \n\n4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe and inject the reconstituted solution into a vein. The \nsolution should be administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient’s comfort level, \nnot to exceed 10 ml per minute. (See Section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n5. Discard any unused solution appropriately. \n \nFig. d       Fig. e \n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nOn demand treatment \nIn case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period.

How to use ADVATE \n \nTreatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your \ncondition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The \nfrequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the \nreplacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nPrevention of bleeding \nThe usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. \nHowever, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may \nbe necessary. \n \n\n\n\n228 \n\nTreatment of bleeding \nThe dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n \nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5 \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor. \nYour doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII \nlevels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n \nUse in children and adolescents (from 0 to 18 years of age) \nFor the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the \nprevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to \n4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does \nnot differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become \nnecessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products. \n \nHow ADVATE is given \nADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else \nmight also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed \ninstructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. \n \nIf you use more ADVATE than you should \nAlways take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \nare not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to use ADVATE \nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as \nscheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n \nIf you stop using ADVATE \nDo not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped \nimmediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early \nsymptoms of allergic reactions: \n \n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n \nSevere symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency \ntreatment.  \n \nFor children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) \nmay form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous \ntreatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 \n\n\n\n229 \n\npeople). If this happens your or your child’s medicines may stop working properly and you or your \nchild may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nFactor VIII inhibitors (for children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines).  \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nheadache and fever. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nFactor VIII inhibitors (for patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than \n150 days of treatment)), dizziness, flu, fainting, abnormal heartbeat, red itchy bumps on the skin, chest \ndiscomfort, injection site bruise, injection site reaction, itching, increased sweating, unusual taste in \nthe mouth, hot flushes, migraines, memory impairment, chills, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, shortness \nof breath, sore throat, infection of the lymphatic vessels, whitening of skin, eye inflammation, rashes, \nexcessive sweating, foot and leg swelling, reduced percentage of red blood cells, increase in a type of \nwhite blood cells (monocytes), and pain in the upper abdomen or lower chest. \n \nRelated to surgery \ncatheter-related infection, decreased red cell blood count, swelling of limbs and joints, prolonged \nbleeding after drain removal, decreased Factor VIII level and post-operative bruise. \n \nRelated to central venous access devices (CVAD) \ncatheter-related infection, systemic infection and local blood clot at the catheter site. \n \nSide effects with unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \npotentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis) and other allergic reactions (hypersensitivity), \ngeneral disorders (tiredness, lack of energy). \n \nAdditional side effects in children \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in side effects were noted in the clinical \nstudies. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

What you need to know before you use ADVATE \n3. How to use ADVATE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store ADVATE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for \n \nADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. \nIn patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. \n \nADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with \nhaemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). \n \nADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire \nmanufacturing process. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE \n \nDo not use ADVATE \n- if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins \n \nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously \ntreated with Factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher \nrisk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy \nof ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the \n\n\n\n234 \n\ntreatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nThere is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \nreaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, \nwheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in \nthe chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early \nsymptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme \ndizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing. \nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe \nsymptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. \n \nPatients developing Factor VIII inhibitors \nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \nall Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \nyou or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age). \n \nOther medicines and ADVATE \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nADVATE has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nADVATE contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken into consideration by patients \non a controlled sodium diet. \n \nMisapplication of ADVATE \nMisapplication (injection into the artery or outside the vein) should be avoided as mild, short term \ninjection site reactions, such as bruising and redness, may occur. \n \n \n3. How to use ADVATE \n \nTreatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your \ncondition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The \nfrequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the \nreplacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nPrevention of bleeding \nThe usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. \nHowever, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may \nbe necessary. \n\n\n\n235 \n\n \nTreatment of bleeding \nThe dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n \nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5 \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor. \nYour doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII \nlevels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n \nUse in children and adolescents (from 0 to 18 years of age) \nFor the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the \nprevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to \n4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does \nnot differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become \nnecessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.  \n \nDue to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, the time to react to \nhypersensitivity reactions during an injection is further reduced. Therefore, caution is advised during \ninjection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, especially in children. \n \nHow ADVATE is given \nADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else \nmight also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed \ninstructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. \n \nIf you use more ADVATE than you should \nAlways take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \nare not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to use ADVATE \nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as \nscheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n \nIf you stop using ADVATE \nDo not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped \nimmediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early \nsymptoms of allergic reactions: \n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n \nSevere symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency \ntreatment.  \n \n\n\n\n236 \n\nFor children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) \nmay form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous \ntreatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 \npeople). If this happens your or your child’s medicines may stop working properly and you or your \nchild may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nFactor VIII inhibitors (for children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines).  \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nheadache and fever. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nFactor VIII inhibitors (for patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than \n150 days of treatment)), dizziness, flu, fainting, abnormal heartbeat, red itchy bumps on the skin, chest \ndiscomfort, injection site bruise, injection site reaction, itching, increased sweating, unusual taste in \nthe mouth, hot flushes, migraines, memory impairment, chills, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, shortness \nof breath, sore throat, infection of the lymphatic vessels, whitening of skin, eye inflammation, rashes, \nexcessive sweating, foot and leg swelling, reduced percentage of red blood cells, increase in a type of \nwhite blood cells (monocytes), and pain in the upper abdomen or lower chest. \n \nRelated to surgery \ncatheter-related infection, decreased red cell blood count, swelling of limbs and joints, prolonged \nbleeding after drain removal, decreased Factor VIII level and post-operative bruise. \n \nRelated to central venous access devices (CVAD) \ncatheter-related infection, systemic infection and local blood clot at the catheter site. \n \nSide effects with unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \npotentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis) and other allergic reactions (hypersensitivity), \ngeneral disorders (tiredness, lack of energy). \n \nAdditional side effects in children \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in side effects were noted in the clinical \nstudies. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store ADVATE \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date, which is stated on the label after EXP.

What you need to know before you use ADVATE \n3. How to use ADVATE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store ADVATE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for \n \nADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. \nIn patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. \n \nADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with \nhaemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). \n \nADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire \nmanufacturing process. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE \n \nDo not use ADVATE \n- if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins \n \nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously \ntreated with Factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher \nrisk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy \nof ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the \n\n\n\n242 \n\ntreatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nThere is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \nreaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, \nwheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in \nthe chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early \nsymptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme \ndizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing. \n \nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe \nsymptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. \n \nPatients developing Factor VIII inhibitors \nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \nall Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \nyou or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age). \n \nOther medicines and ADVATE \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nADVATE has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nADVATE contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken into consideration by patients \non a controlled sodium diet. \n \nMisapplication of ADVATE \nMisapplication (injection into the artery or outside the vein) should be avoided as mild, short term \ninjection site reactions, such as bruising and redness, may occur. \n \n \n3. How to use ADVATE \n \nTreatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your \ncondition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The \nfrequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the \nreplacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \n\n\n\n243 \n\nPrevention of bleeding \nThe usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. \nHowever, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may \nbe necessary. \n \nTreatment of bleeding \nThe dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n \nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5 \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor. \nYour doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII \nlevels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n \nUse in children and adolescents (from 0 to 18 years of age) \nFor the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the \nprevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to \n4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does \nnot differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become \nnecessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.  \n \nDue to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, the time to react to \nhypersensitivity reactions during an injection is further reduced. Therefore, caution is advised during \ninjection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, especially in children. \n \nHow ADVATE is given \nADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else \nmight also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed \ninstructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. \n \nIf you use more ADVATE than you should \nAlways take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \nare not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to use ADVATE \nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as \nscheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n \nIf you stop using ADVATE \nDo not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped \nimmediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early \nsymptoms of allergic reactions: \n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n\n\n\n244 \n\n \nSevere symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency \ntreatment.  \n \nFor children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) \nmay form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous \ntreatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 \npeople). If this happens your or your child’s medicines may stop working properly and you or your \nchild may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nFactor VIII inhibitors (for children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines).  \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nheadache and fever. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nFactor VIII inhibitors (for patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than \n150 days of treatment)), dizziness, flu, fainting, abnormal heartbeat, red itchy bumps on the skin, chest \ndiscomfort, injection site bruise, injection site reaction, itching, increased sweating, unusual taste in \nthe mouth, hot flushes, migraines, memory impairment, chills, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, shortness \nof breath, sore throat, infection of the lymphatic vessels, whitening of skin, eye inflammation, rashes, \nexcessive sweating, foot and leg swelling, reduced percentage of red blood cells, increase in a type of \nwhite blood cells (monocytes), and pain in the upper abdomen or lower chest. \n \nRelated to surgery \ncatheter-related infection, decreased red cell blood count, swelling of limbs and joints, prolonged \nbleeding after drain removal, decreased Factor VIII level and post-operative bruise. \n \nRelated to central venous access devices (CVAD) \ncatheter-related infection, systemic infection and local blood clot at the catheter site. \n \nSide effects with unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \npotentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis) and other allergic reactions (hypersensitivity), \ngeneral disorders (tiredness, lack of energy). \n \nAdditional side effects in children \nOther than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and \ncatheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in side effects were noted in the clinical \nstudies. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.
