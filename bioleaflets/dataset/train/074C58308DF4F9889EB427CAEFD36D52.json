NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPanretin 0.1 % gel\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\n1 g of gel contains 1 mg alitretinoin (0.1%).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nGel.\nClear yellow gel.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPanretin gel is indicated for the topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS-\nrelated Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KS) when:\n\n- lesions are not ulcerated or lymphoedematous\n- treatment of visceral KS is not required\n- lesions are not responding to systemic antiretroviral therapy\n- radiotherapy or chemotherapy are not appropriate\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPanretin therapy should only be initiated and maintained by specialist physicians experienced in \nthe treatment of patients with KS.\n\nMen\nPatients should apply Panretin to cutaneous KS lesions using sufficient gel so as to cover each \nlesion with a generous coating. \n\nFrequency of application\nPatients should initially apply Panretin twice a day to cutaneous KS lesions. The application \nfrequency can be increased stepwise to three or four times a day according to individual lesion \ntolerance, allowing no less than two weeks between dose increases. The frequency of application \nshould be adjusted for each lesion independently. If application site toxicity occurs, the \napplication frequency can be reduced as described below. There are no data on the efficacy of \nPanretin applied less frequently than twice daily.\n\nLocal dermal irritation may be graded according to the five-point scale shown in Table 1. \nGuidelines for treatment adjustments necessitated by local dermal treatment-related toxicity are \nspecified in Table 2. \n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1 Grading of local dermal irritation\nGRADE DEFINING CLINICAL SIGNS\n0  =  No reaction None\n1  =  Mild Definite pink to red coloration\n2  =  Moderate Increased redness, possible oedema\n3  =  Severe Very red, with oedema, with or without vesiculation\n4  =  Very severe Deep red, swelling and oedema with or without signs of bullae \n\nformation and necrosis\n\nTable 2 Adjustment guidelines for treatment-limiting toxicity\nLOCAL DERMAL IRRITATION\n\n(Graded per Table 1) TREATMENT ADJUSTMENTS\nGrade 0, 1 or 2 No action required except continued monitoring.\nGrade 3 Treatment frequency for that lesion should be reduced or \n\nsuspended. When dermal irritation improves to Grade 0 or \n1, treatment may be restarted at twice daily, increasing \nevery two weeks as tolerated.\n\nGrade 4 As for Grade 3 irritation. However, treatment should not be \nrestarted if Grade 4 toxicity occurred at an application \nfrequency of less than twice a day.\n\nDuration of application\nIt is recommended that Panretin should be applied to lesions for an initial period of up to \n12 weeks. Treatment of lesions that have not shown a decrease in area and/or height by week 12 \nshould be discontinued.\nFor those lesions that have shown a decrease in height and/or area by week 12, applications may \nbe continued providing that there is continued improvement or at least maintenance of the \nresponse and that the product continues to be tolerated.\nTreatment of any lesion that has fully resolved on clinical assessment should be discontinued.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\nPatients should wash their hands before and after applications; it is not necessary to wear gloves.\nThe gel must be allowed to dry for three to five minutes before covering with clothing. \nOcclusive dressings should be avoided.\nCare must be taken to avoid application of the gel to normal skin surrounding the lesions.\nGel should not be applied on or near eyes or mucosal surfaces of the body. Showering, bathing, \nor swimming for at least three hours after any application should be avoided.\n\nWomen\nSafety and effectiveness in women have not been established because of the paucity of clinical \ndata. AIDS-related Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma is infrequent in women.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Panretin gel in children under 18 years has not been established.\nNo data are available.\nPanretin is not approved for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\nElderly men\nThere are no specific recommendations for use in elderly men (above 65 years of age). AIDS-\nrelated Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma is infrequent in this population.\n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment\nThere are no data regarding the use of Panretin gel in patients with renal insufficiency or liver \ndisease. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the range and frequency of detection of \nquantifiable 9-cis-retinoic acid plasma concentrations in patients with KS after application of the \nmedicinal product were comparable to the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable \n\n\n\n4\n\nplasma concentrations of circulating, naturally-occurring 9-cis-retinoic acid in untreated \nindividuals (see section 5.2). On a theoretical basis, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal insufficiency or liver disease, but these patients should be closely monitored and \ntreatment frequency reduced, or withdrawn, if they experience adverse effects.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to retinoids in general, to the active substance alitretinoin or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n\uf0b7 Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6).\n\uf0b7 Women planning a pregnancy.\n\uf0b7 Treatment of KS lesions in close proximity to other skin disorders.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRetinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. There were no reports of \nphotosensitivity associated with the use of Panretin gel in the clinical studies. However, patients \nmust be cautioned to minimise exposure of treated areas to sunlight or other ultraviolet (UV) \nlight. (see section 5.3).\n\nIt is recommended that daily dietary intake of vitamin A should not exceed the Recommended \nDietary Intake value. \n\nAlitretinoin may cause harm to the foetus. Women of child-bearing potential must use a reliable \nform of contraception during treatment with Panretin gel (see section 4.6) and until one month \nafter cessation of treatment.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe use of other topical products on Panretin treated KS lesions should be avoided. Mineral oil may \nbe used between Panretin applications in order to help prevent excessive dryness or itching. \nHowever, mineral oil should not be applied for at least two hours before or after the application of \nPanretin.\n\nIt is not recommended for patients to apply Panretin gel concurrently with products that contain \nN,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET ), a common component of insect repellent products. Animal \ntoxicology studies showed increased DEET toxicity when DEET was included as part of the \nformulation.\n\nThe range and frequency of detection of quantifiable plasma 9-cis-retinoic acid concentrations in \npatients with KS applying the medicinal product to up to 64 lesions were comparable to \nrespective values in untreated patients. Therefore, there is a low potential for interactions with \nsystemic medicinal products.\n\nThere was no clinical evidence in the vehicle-controlled studies of interactions with systemic \nantiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors; macrolide antibiotics and azole antifungals. \nWhile no data are available, it is possible that co-administration of medicinal products which \ninduce CYP isozymes may reduce circulating levels of alitretinoin, with a possible negative \neffect on the efficacy of Panretin gel.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential must use effective contraception during, and up to one month after \ncessation of treatment.\n\n\n\n5\n\nMen using Panretin should take precautions to ensure that their female partners do not become \npregnant.\n\nPregnancy\n\nOrally administered retinoids have been associated with congenital abnormalities. When used in \naccordance with the prescribing information topically administered retinoids are generally \nassumed to result in low systemic exposure due to minimal dermal absorption. However there \ncould be individual factors (e.g. damaged skin barrier, excessive use) that contribute to an \nincreased systemic exposure.\nIn rabbits, alitretinoin was shown to be teratogenic at a dose which resulted in plasma concentrations \nabout 60 times the highest observed plasma concentration in male patients with KS following topical \napplication of the gel. However, it is not currently certain to what extent topical treatment with \nPanretin gel would increase 9-cis-retinoic acid plasma concentrations, in women with KS above \nnaturally occurring levels; therefore, Panretin is contraindicated ( see section 4.3) in pregnancy, or in \nwomen planning a pregnancy. If the product is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes \npregnant while taking this drug, treatment should be discontinued. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether this medicinal product is excreted in human milk. Based on the plasma \nconcentrations observed in patients, milk concentrations of 9-cis-retinoic acid probably pose a \nlow risk for the infant. However, because of the potential for undesirable effects from Panretin \ngel in infants being breast-fed, mothers must discontinue breast-feeding prior to using the \nmedicinal product and not initiate breast-feeding while using the medicinal product.\n\nCare should be taken not to bring the neonate into skin contact with areas to which Panretin has been \nrecently applied. It is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their children to \nexclude the risk of transmission of the virus.\n\nFertility\n\nNo specific studies on fertility have been conducted in men or women. However, alitretinoin is \nteratogenic so both men and women should take adequate precautions to avoid female partners \nbecoming pregnant.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPanretin gel is for cutaneous use and is unlikely to have an effect on the ability to drive and use\nmachines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nAdverse events associated with the use of Panretin gel in AIDS-related KS occurred almost \nexclusively at the site of application. The dermal toxicity typically begins as erythema; with \ncontinued application of Panretin gel erythema may increase and oedema may develop. Dermal \ntoxicity may become treatment-limiting, with intense erythema, oedema, and vesiculation. When \napplying Panretin gel, 69.1% of patients experienced adverse drug reactions at the application \nsite.\n\nTable 3 shows the following application-site drug-related adverse reactions were reported during \nclinical studies in patients with KS. The frequency of adverse events are classified as very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). Adverse \nevents include verbatim terms in parentheses.\n\n\n\n6\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.\n\nTable 3 Adverse reactions reported in patients in clinical trials\nSystem Organ Class\n(MedDRA terminology)\n\nVery common Common Uncommon\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nLymphadenopathy\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nParaesthesia (stinging, \ntingling)\n\nVascular disorders Haemorrhage (bleeding \nat or around lesions), \n\nOedema (oedema, \nswelling, inflammation), \n\nPeripheral oedema\n\nPhlebitis, Vascular \ndisorder\n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorder\n\nSkin disorder (cracking, \nscab, crusting, \n\nexcoriation, drainage, \noozing), Rash \n\n(erythema, redness, \nscaling, irritation, \n\ndermatitis), Pruritus \n(itching, pruritus)\n\nSkin ulcer, Serous \ndrainage, Exfoliative \ndermatitis (flaking, \n\npeeling, desquamation, \nexfoliation), Skin \n\ndiscoloration (brown \ndiscoloration, \nsurrounding \n\nhyperpigmentation, \npaler), Dry skin\n\nCellulitis, \nVesiculobullous rash, \nMaculopapular rash, \n\nAllergic reaction\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nPain (burning, pain, \nsoreness)\n\nInfection, including \nbacterial infection\n\nThe safety of Panretin gel has been assessed in clinical studies of more than 469 patients with \nAIDS-related KS, 439 of whom were treated with an alitretinoin concentration of 0.1%.\n\nThe incidence of drug-related skin disorder, skin ulcer, pain and rash appeared to be greater in \npatients applying Panretin gel four times daily than in those applying it less frequently. \nHowever, the incidence of other equally common drug-related adverse events such as pruritus, \noedema, exfoliative dermatitis and dry skin did not appear to increase as a function of the \nfrequency of application.\n\nThe incidence of mild/moderate rash (all events regardless of causality) was less in patients \ntreated for less than 16 weeks than in those treated for 16 weeks or more (mild, 33% v 63%; \nmoderate, 29% v 43%). The incidence of severe skin rash was independent of the duration of \ntreatment (10% in both cases).\n\nLocal dermal toxicity associated with Panretin gel therapy generally resolved with treatment \nadjustment or discontinuation (see section 4.2).\n\nOnly two serious adverse reactions were reported (sepsis and cellulitis in the same patient).\n\nThe adverse events seen with Panretin gel are similar to those seen with other topical retinoids. It \nis unlikely that the undesirable systemic side effects associated with oral retinoids will be \nobserved with the use of Panretin gel because the range and frequency of quantifiable \n9-cis-retinoic acid plasma levels concentrations after application of the medicinal product were \ncomparable to the range and frequency of quantifiable plasma concentrations of circulating, \nnaturally occurring 9-cis-retinoic acid in untreated individuals.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n7\n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported.\n\nSystemic toxicity following acute overdose with topical application of Panretin gel is unlikely.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: LO1XX22\n\nAlthough the molecular action of alitretinoin is thought to be mediated through interaction with \nthe retinoid receptors, the exact mechanism of action of this medicinal product in the topical \ntreatment of cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS is unknown. Alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic \nacid), a naturally-occurring endogenous hormone related to vitamin A, binds to and activates all \nknown intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RAR\uf061, RAR\uf062, RAR\uf067, RXR\uf061, RXR\uf062, RXR\uf067). \nOnce activated, these receptors function as ligand dependent transcription factors that regulate \nthe expression of specific genes. The regulation of gene expression by alitretinoin controls the \nprocess of cellular differentiation and proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cells. The \nefficacy of Panretin gel in treating KS lesions may be related to the demonstrated ability of \nalitretinoin to inhibit the in vitro growth of KS cells.\n\nPanretin gel can be expected to have local therapeutic effects only and it has no role in the \nprevention or treatment of visceral KS.\n\nTwo controlled, multicentre, randomised, double blind parallel group, Phase III studies provided \nthe data for Panretin gel in the treatment of index cutaneous lesions of KS (Table 4). The patient \nresponse rate was evaluated using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) criteria for lesion \nresponse in KS. Study 1 included an open-label phase, in which patients themselves elected to \nenroll. Study 2 was followed by an open label study (Study 2a), which included only patients \nelecting to continue from Study 2.\n\nTable 4 Best response according to ACTG criteria for vehicle controlled phase\nStudy 1 (TID, QID)1 Study 2 (BD)2\n\nPanretin\nN= 134\n\nVehicle\nN=134\n\nPanretin\nN=62\n\nVehicle\nN=72\n\nClinical Complete \nResponse (CCR) %\n\n0.7 0.0 1.6 0.0\n\nPartial Response (PR) % 34.3 17.9 35.5 6.9\n\nStable Disease % 50.0 59.0 43.5 58.3\n\nProgressive Disease % 14.9 23.1 19.4 34.7\n\nOverall Response % 35.1 17.9\np=0.002\n\n37.1 6.9\np= 0.00003\n\n1.

Protocol-specified dose regimen was application twice a day (BD) only, with downward\nadjustments for toxicity.\n\nIn the open label phase of Study 1 (N = 184), the overall response rate increased to 66.7%. In \nStudy 2a (N = 99), the overall response rate increased to 56.1%.\n\nIn study 1, of 110 responding patients, 36 (33%) relapsed, while all but four still being on active \ntreatment.\n\nResponse rates were analysed both by the patient as the unit of analysis and by the lesion. \nTable 5 provides the individual lesion response rates for patients being treated with Panretin gel \nin the Phase III studies.\n\nTable 5 Index/indicator lesion1 responses within patients during the first 12 weeks \non study in initial blinded phase\n\nPatients with given number of index/indicator lesion responses (CCR or PR)\nStudy 1 Study 2\n\nNumber of \nResponding \n\nPanretin\n(N=134)\n\nVehicle (N=134) Panretin\n(N=62)\n\nVehicle (N=72)\n\nLesions2,3 N   %4 N   %4 N   %4 N   %4\n\nAt Least One 73 (54.5%) 42 (31.3%) 33 (53.2%) 21 (29.2%)\nAt Least Four 27 (20.1%) 8 (6.0%) 8 (12.9%) 2 (2.8%)\n\n1. Study 1, 6 index lesions; Study 2, up to 8 index lesions\n2. Each index lesion assessed individually for response. \n3. Lesions responding during the first 12 weeks on study, initial blinded phase, confirmed over at \n\nleast four study weeks (confirmation of response may have occurred after 12 weeks for some \nlesions in Study 1).\n\n4. Percentages calculated as number of patients with responding lesions divided by total number of \npatients in the initial blinded phase.\n\nIn one trial, 29% of the lesions that had reached a partial response (PR) but had not attained\nclinical complete response (CCR) within the first 12 weeks of treatment developed a CCR \nduring continuing treatment beyond 12 weeks. The projected time for lesions that were in partial \nresponse (PR) to later attain clinical complete response (CCR) was 168 days. It is recommended \nthat Panretin gel should be applied for an initial treatment period of up to 12 weeks. In lesions \nthat have responded to treatment during this time, application may be continued provided that \nthe response improves or is maintained and the product continues to be tolerated. If a complete \nresponse of a lesion occurs, no further application of Panretin gel should be made to the \nresponding lesion.\n\nThere are no data regarding the efficacy of Panretin gel when applied to complicated lesions \n(e.g., when lymphoedema is present).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPlasma concentrations of 9-cis-retinoic acid were evaluated during clinical studies in patients \nwith cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS after repeated multiple-daily dose application of \nPanretin gel for up to 60 weeks. A subset of these patients were followed during treatment of up \nto 64 lesions (range 4-64, median 11.5 lesions) for up to 44 weeks (range 2-44, median \n15 weeks). In this latter group, the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable 9-cis-retinoic \nacid plasma concentrations in patients with KS after application of the medicinal product were \ncomparable to the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable plasma concentrations of \ncirculating, naturally-occurring 9-cis-retinoic acid in untreated individuals.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nToxicology\n\n\n\n9\n\nThree doses of alitretinoin (0.01%, 0.05%, or 0.5%) in a topical gel formulation were given to \nrats in a 28-day dermal toxicology study. Observed effects at the application site included \nerythema, epidermal thickening, scaling and loosening of the stratum corneum. Clinical \npathology evaluations revealed significant increases in absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte \ncounts, monocyte counts, percentage of monocytes and decreases in percentage of lymphocyte \ndifferential white blood cell counts on day 29 of rats treated with alitretinoin 0.5% gel. Clinical \nchemistry evaluations revealed biologically relevant significant increases in the mean BUN and \nalkaline phosphatase values in females after the 28-day treatment. Serum LDL was increased in \nboth male and female groups at Day 29. There were no biologically relevant haematology \ndifferences or serum chemistry differences after the 14-day period. Observed increases in mean \nheart-to-final body weight differences were attributed principally to the difference in the \nterminal body weights. Following treatment with alitretinoin 0.5% gel, mean plasma \nconcentrations in the female rats were generally below the lower limit of quantitation (5 nMol) \nand mean plasma concentrations in the male rats were about 200 nMol. In contrast to these \nfindings in rats, plasma concentrations of 9-cis-retinoic acid in patients with KS applying \nPanretin gel never exceeded 0.638 ng/ml (2.13 nMol). This level is about 1/100 the mean \nconcentration measured in male rats.\n\nGenotoxicity\n\nAlitretinoin was studied for genotoxic potential using the Ames test, the in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assay, the chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and the CHO cell \nmutation test. The medicinal product was not genotoxic.\n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility\n\nStudies have not been performed to determine the carcinogenic potential of alitretinoin. \nHowever, the mutagenic potential has been evaluated, and alitretinoin has tested negative in the \nAmes test, the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, the chromosomal aberration test in human \nlymphocytes, and the CHO cell mutation test.\n\nTeratogenicity\n\nIn an oral dose-ranging study in rabbits, alitretinoin induced gross malformations at a dose \n35 times the topical human dose. This dose in rabbits resulted in plasma concentrations more \nthan 60 times the highest observed plasma concentration in patients with KS following topical \napplication of Panretin gel. No gross malformations were observed following oral administration \nto rabbits of doses 12 times the human topical dose (which resulted in plasma concentrations \n60 times the highest observed plasma concentration in patients with KS following topical \napplication of the gel). However, an increased rate of fused sternebrae was observed.\n\nPhototoxicity\n\nThe phototoxicity potential of alitretinoin was assessed based on its chemical properties and data \nfrom a battery of in vitro tests. The results suggest that alitretinoin absorbs light in the UV range \nand is subject to photodegradation to other isomers (predominantly all-trans-retinoic acid). \nAlitretinoin was shown to have a weak potential to be a photo-irritant based on histidine and \nphotoprotein binding. In cell-based in vitro assays, alitretinoin showed weak phototoxic \npotential.\n\n6.

How to use Panretin\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nTo open for the first time, use the pointed portion of the cap to puncture the metal safety seal.\n\nHow to apply Panretin: For cutaneous use (on the skin) only\nApply Panretin twice a day to start with, once in the morning and once in the evening. After that, \nyour doctor will decide how often you should apply the gel depending on the response of your \nKS and any side effects.\n\nApply Panretin to your KS lesions using a clean finger. Place a generous coating of gel over the \nwhole surface of each lesion that you want to treat. You do not need to rub the gel into the \nlesion. You need to avoid applying the gel to the healthy skin around the lesion. Carefully \napplying the gel only to the area of the KS lesion will help to lessen any irritation or redness that \nmay occur. Proper application will leave some gel visible on the surface of the lesion when you \nare finished.\n\n- Immediately after application, wipe the finger(s) you have used to apply the gel and any \nhealthy skin touched by the gel with a disposable tissue. Wash your hands using soap and \nwater and wipe the healthy skin touched by the gel.\n\n\n\n21\n\n- Allow the gel to dry for three to five minutes before covering a treated area with loose \nclothing. Do not cover the treated lesions with any bandage or other material.\n\n- A mild soap is recommended when bathing or showering.\n- If you think that the effect of Panretin is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist.\n- Avoid showering, bathing, or swimming for at least three hours after any application.\n- Avoid scratching the treated areas.\n- Panretin contains alcohol. Keep away from naked flame.\n\nYour doctor will tell you how long your treatment will last.\n\n\uf0b7 Do not be discouraged if you do not see immediate improvement.\n\uf0b7 It may take up to 12 weeks for any improvement to show.\n\uf0b7 Do not stop treatment at the first sign of improvement.\n\uf0b7 You may need to reduce the number of daily applications, or stop using Panretin for a \n\nshort while, if you develop unwanted skin effects. It is important that you consult your \ndoctor, who will tell you what to do. \n\nIf you use more Panretin than you should\nThere has been no experience with overdose of Panretin. \n\nIf you forget to take Panretin\nDo not use a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.

often you should apply the gel depending on the response of your ks and any side effects. apply panretin to your ks lesions using a clean finger. place a generous coating of gel over the whole surface of each lesion that you want to treat. you do not need to rub the gel into the lesion. you need to avoid applying the gel to the healthy skin around the lesion. carefully applying the gel only to the area of the ks lesion will help to lessen any irritation or redness that may occur. proper application will leave some gel visible on the surface of the lesion when you are finished. - immediately after application, wipe the finger(s) you have used to apply the gel and any healthy skin touched by the gel with a disposable tissue. wash your hands using soap and water and wipe the healthy skin touched by the gel. - allow the gel to dry for three to five minutes before covering a treated area with loose clothing. do not cover the treated lesions with any bandage or other material. - a mild soap is recommended when bathing or showering. - if you think that the effect of panretin is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. - avoid showering, bathing, or swimming for at least three hours after any application. - avoid scratching the treated areas. - panretin contains alcohol. keep away from naked flame. your doctor will tell you how long your treatment will last. do not be discouraged if you do not see immediate improvement. it may take up to 12 weeks for any improvement to show. do not stop treatment at the first sign of improvement. you may need to reduce the number of daily applications, or stop using panretin for a short while, if you develop unwanted skin effects. it is important that you consult your doctor, who will tell you what to do. if you use more panretin than you should there has been no experience with overdose of panretin. if you forget to take panretin do not use a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. apply the next dose at the usual time. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "panretin", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
