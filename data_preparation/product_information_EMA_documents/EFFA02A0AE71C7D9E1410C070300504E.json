NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEntacapone Teva 200 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg entacapone. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nLight brown, biconvex, ellipse-shaped film-coated tablets with approximately 18 mm length and \n10 mm width, embossed ‘E200’ on one side, plain on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEntacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/benserazide or \nlevodopa/carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor \nfluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEntacapone should only be used in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa. \nThe prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is applicable to their concomitant use \nwith entacapone. \n \nPosology \n \nOne 200 mg tablet is taken with each levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose. The maximum \nrecommended dose is 200 mg ten times daily, i.e. 2,000 mg of entacapone. \n \nEntacapone enhances the effects of levodopa. Hence, to reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic \nadverse reactions, e.g. dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting and hallucinations, it is often necessary to adjust \nlevodopa dosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment. The daily \ndose of levodopa should be reduced by about 10-30% by extending the dosing intervals and/or by \nreducing the amount of levodopa per dose, according to the clinical condition of the patient. \n \nIf entacapone treatment is discontinued, it is necessary to adjust the dosing of other antiparkinsonian \ntreatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the parkinsonian symptoms. \n \nEntacapone increases the bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/benserazide \npreparations slightly (5-10%) more than from standard levodopa/carbidopa preparations. Hence, \npatients who are taking standard levodopa/benserazide preparations may need a larger reduction of \nlevodopa dose when entacapone is initiated. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \n\n 2 \n\n\n\nRenal insufficiency does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone and there is no need for dose \nadjustment. However, for patients who are receiving dialysis therapy, a longer dosing interval may be \nconsidered (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment  \nSee section 4.3. \n \nElderly patients  \nNo dosage adjustment of entacapone is required for elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Entacapone Teva in children below age 18 have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEntacapone is administered orally and simultaneously with each levodopa/carbidopa or \nlevodopa/benserazide dose. \n \nEntacapone can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Hepatic impairment. \n- Phaeochromocytoma. \n- Concomitant use of entacapone and non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B) \n\ninhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, tranylcypromine). \n- Concomitant use of a selective MAO-A inhibitor plus a selective MAO-B inhibitor and \n\nentacapone (see section 4.5). \n- A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic \n\nrhabdomyolysis. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRhabdomyolysis secondary to severe dyskinesias or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been \nobserved rarely in patients with Parkinson’s disease. \n \nNMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, \nmyoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e.g. agitation, confusion, coma), hyperthermia, autonomic \ndysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase. In \nindividual cases, only some of these symptoms and/or findings may be evident. \n \nNeither NMS nor rhabdomyolysis have been reported in association with entacapone treatment from \ncontrolled trials in which entacapone was discontinued abruptly. Since the introduction into the \nmarket, isolated cases of NMS have been reported, especially following abrupt reduction or \ndiscontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant dopaminergic medicinal products. When \nconsidered necessary, withdrawal of entacapone and other dopaminergic treatment should proceed \nslowly, and if signs and/or symptoms occur despite a slow withdrawal of entacapone, an increase in \nlevodopa dosage may be necessary. \n \nEntacapone therapy should be administered cautiously to patients with ischemic heart disease. \n \nBecause of its mechanism of action, entacapone may interfere with the metabolism of medicinal \nproducts containing a catechol group and potentiate their action. Thus, entacapone should be \nadministered cautiously to patients being treated with medicinal products metabolised by catechol-O-\n\n 3 \n\n\n\nmethyl transferase (COMT), e.g. rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, \ndobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, and apomorphine (see also section 4.5). \n \nEntacapone is always given as an adjunct to levodopa treatment. Hence, the precautions valid for \nlevodopa treatment should also be taken into account for entacapone treatment. Entacapone increases \nthe bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/benserazide preparations 5-10% more than \nfrom standard levodopa/carbidopa preparations. Consequently, adverse dopaminergic reactions may \nbe more frequent when entacapone is added to levodopa/benserazide treatment (see also section 4.8). \nTo reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic adverse reactions, it is often necessary to adjust levodopa \ndosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment, according to the \nclinical condition of the patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nEntacapone may aggravate levodopa-induced orthostatic hypotension. Entacapone should be given \ncautiously to patients who are taking other medicinal products which may cause orthostatic \nhypotension. \n \nIn clinical studies, adverse dopaminergic reactions, e.g. dyskinesia, were more common in patients \nwho received entacapone and dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine), selegiline or amantadine \ncompared to those who received placebo with this combination. The doses of other antiparkinsonian \nmedicinal products may need to be adjusted when entacapone treatment is initiated. \n \nEntacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of \nsudden sleep onset in patients with Parkinson’s disease and caution should therefore be exercised \nwhen driving or operating machines (see also section 4.7). \n \nFor patients experiencing diarrhoea, a follow-up of weight is recommended in order to avoid potential \nexcessive weight decrease. Prolonged or persistent diarrhoea appearing during use of entacapone may \nbe a sign of colitis. In the event of prolonged or persistent diarrhoea, the medicinal product should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate medical therapy and investigations considered. \n \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other \ndopaminergic treatments such as Entacapone Teva in association with levodopa. Review of treatment \nis recommended if such symptoms develop. \n \nFor patients who experience progressive anorexia, asthenia and weight decrease within a relatively \nshort period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be considered. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction of entacapone with carbidopa has been observed with the recommended treatment \nschedule. Pharmacokinetic interaction with benserazide has not been studied. \n \nIn single-dose studies in healthy volunteers, no interactions were observed between entacapone and \nimipramine or between entacapone and moclobemide. Similarly, no interactions between entacapone \nand selegiline were observed in repeated-dose studies in parkinsonian patients. However, the \nexperience of the clinical use of entacapone with several medicinal products, including MAO-A \ninhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, \nmaprotiline and venlafaxine, and medicinal products that are metabolised by COMT (e.g. catechol-\nstructured compounds: rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, \nalpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, and paroxetine) is still limited. Caution should be exercised when \nthese medicinal products are used concomitantly with entacapone (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n\n 4 \n\n\n\nEntacapone may be used with selegiline (a selective MAO-B inhibitor), but the daily dose of \nselegiline should not exceed 10 mg. \n \nEntacapone may form chelates with iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Entacapone and iron \npreparations should be taken at least 2-3 hours apart (see section 4.8). \n \nEntacapone binds to human albumin binding site II which also binds several other medicinal products, \nincluding diazepam and ibuprofen. Clinical interaction studies with diazepam and non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory medicinal products have not been carried out. According to in vitro studies, significant \ndisplacement is not anticipated at therapeutic concentrations of the medicinal products. \n \nDue to its affinity to cytochrome P450 2C9 in vitro (see section 5.2), entacapone may potentially \ninterfere with medicinal products with metabolism dependent on this isoenzyme, such as S-warfarin. \n \nHowever, in an interaction study with healthy volunteers, entacapone did not change the plasma levels \nof S-warfarin, while the AUC for R-warfarin increased on average by 18 % [CI90 11–26%]. The INR \nvalues increased on average by 13% [CI90 6–19%]. Thus, control of INR is recommended when \nentacapone treatment is initiated for patients receiving warfarin.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo overt teratogenic or primary foetotoxic effects were observed in animal studies in which the \nexposure levels of entacapone were markedly higher than the therapeutic exposure levels. As there is \nno experience in pregnant women, entacapone should not be used during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIn animal studies entacapone was excreted in milk. The safety of entacapone in infants is unknown. \nWomen should not breast-feed during treatment with entacapone. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEntacapone Teva in association with levodopa may have major influence on the ability to drive and \nuse machines. Entacapone may, together with levodopa, cause dizziness and symptomatic \northostatism. Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines. \n \nPatients being treated with entacapone in association with levodopa and presenting with somnolence \nand/or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities \nwhere impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. \noperating machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see also section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequent adverse reactions caused by entacapone relate to the increased dopaminergic \nactivity and occur most commonly at the beginning of the treatment. Reduction of levodopa dosage \ndecreases the severity and frequency of these reactions. The other major class of adverse reactions are \ngastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhoea. \nUrine may be discoloured reddish-brown by entacapone, but this is a harmless phenomenon. \n \nUsually the adverse reactions caused by entacapone are mild to moderate. In clinical studies the most \ncommon adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of entacapone treatment have been \ngastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea, 2.5%) and increased dopaminergic adverse reactions of \nlevodopa (e.g. dyskinesias, 1.7%). \n \n\n 5 \n\n\n\nDyskinesias (27%), nausea (11%), diarrhoea (8%), abdominal pain (7%) and dry mouth (4.2%) were \nreported significantly more often with entacapone than with placebo in pooled data from clinical \nstudies involving 406 patients taking the medicinal product and 296 patients taking placebo. \n \nSome of the adverse reactions, such as dyskinesia, nausea, and abdominal pain, may be more common \nwith the higher doses (1,400 to 2,000 mg per day) than with the lower doses of entacapone. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated both from clinical \nstudies with entacapone and since the introduction of entacapone into the market. \n \nTable 1. Adverse drug reactions* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n Common:  Insomnia, hallucinations, confusion, paroniria \n Very rare: Agitation \nNervous system disorders \n Very common:  Dyskinesia \n Common:  Parkinsonism aggravated, dizziness, dystonia, hyperkinesia \nCardiac disorders** \n\nCommon:  Ischemic heart disease events other than myocardial \ninfarction (e.g. angina pectoris) \n\n Uncommon: Myocardial infarction \nGastrointestinal disorders \n Very common:  Nausea \n Common:  Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, constipation, vomiting \n Very rare: Anorexia \n Not known:  Colitis \nHepatobiliary disorders \n Rare:  Hepatic function tests abnormal \n Not known:  Hepatitis with mainly cholestatic features (see section 4.4.) \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Rare:  Erythematous or maculopapular rash \n Very rare: Urticaria  \n Not known:  Skin, hair, beard and nail discolorations \nRenal and urinary disorders \n Very common:  Urine discoloration \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Common:  Fatigue, sweating increased, fall \n Very rare: Weight decrease \n\n \n* Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the \n\nfollowing convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data, since no valid estimate can be derived from clinical \ntrials or epidemiological studies). \n\n** The incidence rates of myocardial infarction and other ischemic heart disease events (0.43% \nand 1.54%, respectively) are derived from an analysis of 13 double-blind studies involving \n2082 patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations receiving entacapone. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nEntacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with isolated cases of excessive daytime \nsomnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes. \n \n\n 6 \n\n\n\nImpulse control disorders: Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive \nspending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine \nagonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as Entacapone Teva in association with levodopa \n(see section 4.4). \n \nIsolated cases of NMS have been reported following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of \nentacapone and other dopaminergic treatments. \n \nIsolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe post-marketing data include isolated cases of overdose in which the reported highest daily dose of \nentacapone has been 16,000 mg. The acute symptoms and signs in these cases of overdose included \nconfusion, decreased activity, somnolence, hypotonia, skin discolouration and urticaria. Management \nof acute overdose is symptomatic. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BX02. \n \nEntacapone belongs to a new therapeutic class, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors. It \nis a reversible, specific, and mainly peripherally acting COMT inhibitor designed for concomitant \nadministration with levodopa preparations. Entacapone decreases the metabolic loss of levodopa to 3-\nO-methyldopa (3-OMD) by inhibiting the COMT enzyme. This leads to a higher levodopa AUC. The \namount of levodopa available to the brain is increased. Entacapone thus prolongs the clinical response \nto levodopa. \n \nEntacapone inhibits the COMT enzyme mainly in peripheral tissues. COMT inhibition in red blood \ncells closely follows the plasma concentrations of entacapone, thus clearly indicating the reversible \nnature of COMT inhibition. \n \nClinical studies \nIn two phase III double-blind studies in a total of 376 patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-\ndose motor fluctuations, entacapone or placebo was given with each levodopa/dopa decarboxylase \ninhibitor dose. The results are given in Table 2. In study I, daily ON time (hours) was measured from \nhome diaries and in study II, the proportion of daily ON time. \n \nTable 2.

The corresponding figures in study II were –18% and –5%. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral characteristics of the active substance \n \nAbsorption \nThere are large intra- and interindividual variations in the absorption of entacapone. \n \nThe peak concentration (Cmax) in plasma is usually reached about one hour after ingestion of a 200 mg \nentacapone tablet. The substance is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism. The bioavailability of \nentacapone is about 35% after an oral dose. Food does not affect the absorption of entacapone to any \nsignificant extent. \n \nDistribution \nAfter absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, entacapone is rapidly distributed to the peripheral \ntissues with a distribution volume of 20 litres at steady state (Vdss). Approximately 92% of the dose is \neliminated during ß-phase with a short elimination half-life of 30 minutes. The total clearance of \nentacapone is about 800 ml/min. \n \nEntacapone is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. In human plasma the \nunbound fraction is about 2.0% in the therapeutic concentration range. At therapeutic concentrations, \nentacapone does not displace other extensively bound substances (e.g. warfarin, salicylic acid, \nphenylbutazone, or diazepam), nor is it displaced to any significant extent by any of these substances \nat therapeutic or higher concentrations. \n \nBiotransformation \nA small amount of entacapone, the (E)-isomer, is converted to its (Z)-isomer. The (E)-isomer accounts \nfor 95% of the AUC of entacapone. The (Z)-isomer and traces of other metabolites account for the \nremaining 5%. \n \nData from in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations indicate that entacapone \ninhibits cytochrome P450 2C9 (IC50 ~4 μM). Entacapone showed little or no inhibition of other types \nof P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A and CYP2C19) (see section \n4.5). \n \nElimination \nThe elimination of entacapone occurs mainly by non-renal metabolic routes. It is estimated that \n80-90% of the dose is excreted in faeces, although this has not been confirmed in man. Approximately \n10-20% is excreted in urine. Only traces of entacapone are found unchanged in urine. The major part \n(95%) of the product excreted in urine is conjugated with glucuronic acid. Of the metabolites found in \nurine only about 1% have been formed through oxidation. \n\n 8 \n\n\n\n \nCharacteristics in patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of entacapone are similar in both young and elderly adults. The \nmetabolism of the medicinal product is slowed in patients with mild to moderate liver insufficiency \n(Child-Pugh Class A and B), which leads to an increased plasma concentration of entacapone in both \nthe absorption and elimination phases (see section 4.3). Renal impairment does not affect the \npharmacokinetics of entacapone. However, a longer dosing interval may be considered for patients \nwho are receiving dialysis therapy. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. In repeated dose \ntoxicity studies, anaemia most likely due to iron chelating properties of entacapone was observed. \nRegarding reproduction toxicity, decreased foetal weight and a slightly delayed bone development \nwere noticed in rabbits at systemic exposure levels in the therapeutic range. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Entacapone Teva is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Entacapone Teva  \n3. How to take Entacapone Teva \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Entacapone Teva  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Entacapone Teva is and what it is used for  \n \nEntacapone Teva tablets contain entacapone and are used together with levodopa to treat Parkinson’s \ndisease. Entacapone Teva aids levodopa in relieving the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Entacapone \nTeva has no effect on relieving the symptoms of Parkinson´s disease unless taken with levodopa. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Entacapone Teva \n \nDo NOT take Entacapone Teva \n• if you are allergic to entacapone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6);  \n• if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as pheochromocytoma; this may increase the \n\nrisk of severe high blood pressure);  \n• if you are taking certain antidepressants (ask your doctor or pharmacist whether your \n\nantidepressive medicine can be taken together with Entacapone Teva);  \n• if you have liver disease;  \n• if you have ever suffered from a rare reaction to antipsychotic medicines called neuroleptic \n\nmalignant syndrome (NMS). See section 4 Possible side effects for the characteristics of NMS; \n• if you have ever suffered from a rare muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis which was not \n\ncaused by injury.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Entacapone Teva: \n• if you have ever had a heart attack or any other diseases of the heart; \n• if you are taking a medicine which may cause dizziness or light-headedness (low blood \n\npressure) when rising from a chair or bed;  \n• if you experience prolonged diarrhoea consult your doctor as it may be a sign of inflammation \n\nof the colon; \n• if you experience diarrhoea, monitoring of your weight is recommended in order to avoid \n\npotentially excessive weight loss;  \n\n 21 \n\n\n\n• if you experience increasing loss of appetite, weakness, exhaustion and weight loss within a \nrelatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be \nconsidered.  \n\n \nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in \nways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain \nactivities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders \nand can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a \npreoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your \ntreatments. \n \nAs Entacapone Teva tablets will be taken together with other levodopa medicines, please also read the \npackage leaflets of these medicines carefully. \n \nThe dose of other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease may need to be adjusted when you start \ntaking Entacapone Teva. Follow the instructions that your doctor has given you. \n \nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a serious but rare reaction to certain medicines, and may \noccur especially when Entacapone Teva and other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease are suddenly \nstopped or the dose is suddenly reduced. For the characteristics of NMS see Section 4 Possible side \neffects. Your doctor may advise you to slowly discontinue the treatment with Entacapone Teva and \nother medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease. \n \nEntacapone Teva taken with levodopa may cause drowsiness and may cause you to sometimes \nsuddenly fall asleep. If this happens, you should not drive or use any tools or machines (see Driving \nand using machines).  \n \nOther medicines and Entacapone Teva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. In particular please tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n• rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, \n\napomorphine;  \n• antidepressants including desipramine, maprotiline, venlafaxine, paroxetine;  \n• warfarin used to thin the blood; \n• iron supplements. Entacapone Teva may make it harder for you to digest iron. Therefore, do \n\nnot take Entacapone Teva and iron supplements at the same time. After taking one of them, \nwait at least 2 to 3 hours before taking the other. \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nDo not use Entacapone Teva during pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding.  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nEntacapone Teva taken together with levodopa may lower your blood pressure, which may make you \nfeel light-headed or dizzy. Be particularly careful when you drive or when you use tools or machinery.  \n \nIn addition, Entacapone Teva taken with levodopa may make you feel very drowsy, or cause you to \nsometimes find yourself suddenly fall asleep. \nDo not drive or operate machinery if you experience these side effects. \n \n3. How to take Entacapone Teva \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\n 22 \n\n\n\n \nEntacapone Teva is taken together with medicines containing levodopa (either levodopa/carbidopa \npreparations or levodopa/benserazide preparations). You may also use other medicines to treat \nParkinson’s disease at the same time.  \n \nThe recommended dose of Entacapone Teva is one 200 mg tablet with each levodopa dose. The \nmaximum recommended dose is 10 tablets per day, i.e. 2,000 mg of Entacapone Teva. \n \nIf you are receiving dialysis for renal insufficiency, your doctor may tell you to increase the time \nbetween doses.  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nExperience with Entacapone Teva in patients under 18 years is limited. Therefore, the use of \nEntacapone Teva in children cannot be recommended. \n \nIf you take more Entacapone Teva than you should  \nIn the event of an overdose, consult your doctor, pharmacist or the nearest hospital immediately.  \n \nIf you forget to take Entacapone Teva  \nIf you forget to take the Entacapone Teva tablet with your levodopa dose, you should continue the \ntreatment by taking the next Entacapone Teva tablet with your next levodopa dose.  \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nIf you stop taking Entacapone Teva \nDo not stop taking Entacapone Teva unless your doctor tells you to.  \n \nWhen stopping your doctor may need to re-adjust the dosage of your other medicines to treat \nParkinson´s disease. Suddenly stopping Entacapone Teva and other medicines to treat Parkinson´s \ndisease may result in unwanted side effects. See Section 2 Warnings and precautions. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Usually \nside effects caused by Entacapone Teva are mild to moderate.  \n \nSome of the side effects are often caused by the increased effects of levodopa therapy and are most \ncommon at the start of treatment. If you experience such effects at the start of treatment with \nEntacapone Teva you should contact your doctor who may decide to adjust your dosage of levodopa. \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- Uncontrollable movements with difficulty in performing voluntary movements (dyskinesias); \n- feeling sick (nausea); \n- harmless reddish-brown discoloration of urine. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Excessive movements (hyperkinesias), worsening of symptoms of Parkinson´s disease, \n\nprolonged muscle cramps (dystonia); \n- being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth; \n- dizziness, tiredness, increased sweating, fall; \n- hallucinations (seeing/hearing/feeling/smelling things that are not really there), sleeplessness, \n\nvivid dreams, and confusion; \n- heart or artery disease events (e.g. chest pain). \n\n 23 \n\n\n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- Heart attack. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- Rashes; \n- abnormal results in liver function test.  \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n- Agitation; \n- decreased appetite, weight loss; \n- hives.  \n\n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n- Inflammation of the colon (colitis), inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) with yellowing of the \n\nskin and whites of the eyes; \n- discolouration of skin, hair, beard and nails.  \n \nWhen Entacapone Teva is given at higher doses: \nIn doses of 1,400 to 2,000 mg per day, the following side effects are more common: \n- Uncontrollable movements; \n- nausea; \n- abdominal pain. \n\n \nOther important side effects which may occur: \n- Entacapone Teva taken with levodopa may rarely make you feel very drowsy during the \n\nday, and cause you to suddenly fall asleep; \n- Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a rare severe reaction to medicines used to treat \n\ndisorders of the nervous system. It is characterised by stiffness, muscle twitching, shaking, \nagitation and confusion, coma, high body temperature, increased heart rate and unstable blood \npressure; \n\n- a rare severe muscle disorder (rhabdomyolysis) which causes pain, tenderness and weakness of \nthe muscles and may lead to kidney problems.  \n\nYou may experience the following side effects: \n- Inability to resist the impulse to perform an action that could be harmful, which may include: \n\n- strong impulse to gamble excessively despite serious personal or family consequences; \n- altered or increased sexual interest and behaviour of significant concern to you or to others, \n\nfor example, an increased sexual drive; \n- uncontrollable excessive shopping or spending; \n- binge eating (eating large amounts of food in a short time period) or compulsive eating \n\n(eating more food than normal and more than is needed to satisfy your hunger). \n \nTell your doctor if you experience any of these behaviours; they will discuss ways of managing or \nreducing the symptoms. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.
