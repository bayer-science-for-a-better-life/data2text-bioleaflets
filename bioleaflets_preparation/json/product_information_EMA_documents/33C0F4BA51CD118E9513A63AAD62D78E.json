CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEffentora is indicated for the treatment of breakthrough pain (BTP) in adults with cancer who are \nalready receiving maintenance opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. \nBTP is a transitory exacerbation of pain that occurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent \npain. \nPatients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral \nmorphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oxycodone \ndaily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week \nor longer. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by and remain under the guidance of a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of opioid therapy in cancer patients. Physicians should keep in mind the potential of \nabuse of fentanyl. Patients should be instructed not to use two different formulations of fentanyl \nconcurrently for the treatment of breakthrough pain, and to dispose of any fentanyl product prescribed \nfor BTP when switching to Effentora. The number of tablet strengths available to the patients at any \ntime should be minimised to prevent confusion and potential overdose. \n \nPosology \n \nDose titration \n \nEffentora should be individually titrated to an “effective” dose that provides adequate analgesia and \nminimises adverse reactions. In clinical studies, the effective dose of Effentora for BTP was not \npredictable from the daily maintenance dose of opioid. \nPatients should be carefully monitored until an effective dose is reached. \n \nTitration in patients not switching from other fentanyl containing products \nThe initial dose of Effentora should be 100 micrograms, titrating upwards as necessary through the \nrange of available tablets strengths (100, 200, 400, 600, 800 micrograms).  \n \nTitration in patients switching from other fentanyl containing products \nDue to different absorption profiles, switching must not be done at a 1:1 ratio. If switching from \nanother oral fentanyl citrate product, independent dose titration with Effentora is required as \nbioavailability between products differs significantly. However, in these patients, a starting dose \nhigher than 100 micrograms may be considered. \n \nMethod of titration \n \nDuring titration, if adequate analgesia is not obtained within 30 minutes after the start of \nadministration of a single tablet, a second Effentora tablet of the same strength may be used.  \n \nIf treatment of a BTP episode requires more than one tablet, an increase in dose to the next higher \navailable strength should be considered to treat the next BTP episode. \n \nDuring titration, multiple tablets may be used: up to four 100 micrograms or up to four 200 \nmicrograms tablets may be used to treat a single episode of BTP during dose titration according to the \nfollowing schedule: \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• If the initial 100 micrograms tablet is not efficacious, the patient can be instructed to treat the next \nepisode of BTP with two 100 micrograms tablets. It is recommended that one tablet should be \nplaced in each side of the mouth. If this dose is considered to be the effective dose, treatment of \nsuccessive episodes of BTP may be continued with a single 200 micrograms tablet of Effentora. \n\n• If a single 200 micrograms tablet of Effentora (or two 100 micrograms tablets) is not considered to \nbe efficacious the patient can be instructed to use two 200 micrograms tablets (or four 100 \nmicrograms tablets) to treat the next episode of BTP. It is recommended that two tablets should be \nplaced in each side of the mouth. If this dose is considered to be the effective dose, treatment of \nsuccessive episodes of BTP may be continued with a single 400 micrograms tablet of Effentora. \n\n• For titration to 600 micrograms and 800 micrograms, tablets of 200 micrograms should be used. \n \nDoses above 800 micrograms were not evaluated in clinical studies. \n \nNo more than two tablets should be used to treat any individual BTP episode, except when titrating \nusing up to four tablets as described above. \nPatients should wait at least 4 hours before treating another BTP episode with Effentora during \ntitration. \n \nMaintenance therapy \n \nOnce an effective dose has been established during titration, patients should continue to take this dose \nas a single tablet of that given strength. Breakthrough pain episodes may vary in intensity and the \nrequired Effentora dose might increase over time due to progression of the underlying cancer disease. \nIn these cases, a second tablet of the same strength may be used. If a second tablet of Effentora was \nrequired for several consecutive times, the usual maintenance dose is to be readjusted (see below). \nPatients should wait at least 4 hours before treating another BTP episode with Effentora during \nmaintenance therapy. \n \nDose readjustment \n \nThe maintenance dose of Effentora should be increased when a patient requires more than one tablet \nper BTP episode for several consecutive BTP episodes. For dose-readjustment the same principles \napply as outlined for dose titration (see above). \nDose readjustment of the background opioid therapy may be required if patients consistently \npresent with more than four BTP episodes per 24 hours. \n \nIn absence of adequate pain control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and progression of \nunderlying disease should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nDiscontinuation of therapy \n \nEffentora should be discontinued immediately if the patient no longer experiences breakthrough pain \nepisodes. The treatment for the persistent background pain should be kept as prescribed.  \nIf discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be closely followed by the doctor \nin order to manage the risk of abrupt withdrawal effects. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nEffentora should be administered with caution to patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal \nimpairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with xerostomia \n \nPatients experiencing xerostomia are advised to drink water to moisten the buccal cavity prior to \nadministration of Effentora. If this recommendation does not result in an appropriate effervescence, \nthen a switch of therapy may be advised. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nUse in the elderly (older than 65 years) \n \nIn clinical studies patients older than 65 years tended to titrate to a lower effective dose than younger \npatients. It is recommended that increased caution should be exercised in titrating the dose of \nEffentora in elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Effentora in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEffentora tablet once exposed to moisture utilises an effervescent reaction to deliver the active \nsubstance. Therefore patients should be instructed not to open the blister until ready to place the tablet \nin the buccal cavity. \n \nOpening the blister package \n \nPatients should be instructed NOT to attempt to push the tablet through the blister because this could \ndamage the buccal tablet. The correct method of releasing the tablet from the blister is: \nOne of the blister units should be separated from the blister card by tearing it apart at the perforations. \nThe blister unit should then be flexed along the line printed on the backing foil where indicated. The \nbacking foil should be peeled back to expose the tablet. \nPatients should be instructed not to attempt to crush or split the tablet. \n \nThe tablet should not be stored once removed from the blister package as the tablet integrity cannot be \nguaranteed and a risk of accidental exposure to a tablet can occur. \n \nTablet administration \n \nPatients should remove the tablet from the blister unit and immediately place the entire Effentora \ntablet in the buccal cavity (near a molar between the cheek and gum).   \n \nThe Effentora tablet should not be sucked, chewed or swallowed, as this will result in lower plasma \nconcentrations than when taken as directed.  \n \nEffentora should be placed and retained within the buccal cavity for a period sufficient to allow \ndisintegration of the tablet which usually takes approximately 14-25 minutes. \nAlternatively, the tablet could be placed sublingually (see section 5.2). \n \nAfter 30 minutes, if remnants from the Effentora tablet remain, they may be swallowed with a glass of \nwater. \n \nThe length of time that the tablet takes to fully disintegrate following oromucosal administration does \nnot appear to affect early systemic exposure to fentanyl. \n \nPatients should not consume any food and drink when a tablet is in the buccal cavity. \nIn case of buccal mucosa irritation, a change in tablet placement within the buccal cavity should be \nrecommended. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Patients without maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory \n\ndepression. \n• Severe respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n• Treatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAccidental use in children \nPatients and their carers must be instructed that Effentora contains an active substance in an amount \nthat can be fatal, especially to a child. Therefore they must keep all tablets out of the sight and reach of \nchildren. \n \nMonitoring \nIn order to minimise the risks of opioid-related undesirable effects and to identify the effective dose, it \nis imperative that patients be monitored closely by health professionals during the titration process. \n \nMaintenance opioid treatment \nIt is important that the maintenance opioid treatment used to treat the patient’s persistent pain has been \nstabilised before Effentora therapy begins and that the patient continues to be treated with the \nmaintenance opioid treatment whilst taking Effentora. The product must not be given to patients \nwithout maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory depression and death. \n \nRespiratory depression  \nAs with all opioids, there is a risk of clinically significant respiratory depression associated with the \nuse of fentanyl. Improper patient selection (e.g., use in patients without maintenance opioid therapy) \nand/or improper dosing have resulted in fatal outcome with Effentora as well as with other fentanyl \nproducts.  \nEffentora should only be used for conditions specified in section 4.1. \n \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease \nParticular caution should be used when titrating Effentora in patients with non-severe chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease or other medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory \ndepression, as even normally therapeutic doses of Effentora may further decrease respiratory drive to \nthe point of respiratory failure. \n \nAlcohol \nThe concomitant use of alcohol with fentanyl can produce increased depressant effects which may \nresult in a fatal outcome (see section 4.5). \n \nRisks of concomitant administration with benzodiazepines or related drugs \nConcomitant use of opioids, including Effentora, with benzodiazepines or related drugs may result in \nprofound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, concomitant \nprescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines or related drugs should be made only in patients for whom \nalternative treatment options are inadequate.  \nIf a decision is made to prescribe Effentora concomitantly with benzodiazepines or related drugs, the \nlowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use should be chosen. Patients should \nbe closely monitored for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see section 4.5). \n \nIncreased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness \nEffentora should only be administered with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly \nsusceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased \nintracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient \nwith a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. \n \nBradyarrhythmias \nFentanyl may produce bradycardia. Fentanyl should be used with caution in patients with previous or \npre-existing bradyarrythmias. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn addition, Effentora should be administered with caution to patients with hepatic or renal \nimpairment. The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of the medicinal \nproduct has not been evaluated, however, when administered intravenously the clearance of fentanyl \nhas been shown to be altered in hepatic and renal impairment due to alterations in metabolic clearance \nand plasma proteins. After administration of Effentora, impaired hepatic and renal function may both \nincrease the bioavailability of swallowed fentanyl and decrease its systemic clearance, which could \nlead to increased and prolonged opioid effects. Therefore, special care should be taken during the \ntitration process in patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal impairment. \n \nCareful consideration should be given to patients with hypovolaemia and hypotension. \n \nSerotonin Syndrome \nCaution is advised when Effentora is co-administered with drugs that affect the serotoninergic \nneurotransmitter systems. \n \nThe development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the concomitant \nuse of serotonergic drugs such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin \nNorepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin \n(including Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [MAOIs]). This may occur within the recommended dose. \n \nSerotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), \nautonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \nabnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., \nnausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). \n \nIf serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with Effentora should be discontinued. \n \nDrug dependence and potential for abuse \nTolerance, physical dependence and psychological dependence may develop upon repeated \nadministration of opioids. Iatrogenic addiction following opioid administration may occur. Fentanyl \ncan be abused in a manner similar to other opioids and all patients treated with opioids require \nmonitoring for signs of abuse and addiction. Patients with a prior history of drug dependence/alcohol \nabuse are more at risk to develop dependence and abuse in opioid treatment. Patients at increased risk \nof opioid abuse may still be appropriately treated with opioids; however, these patients will require \nadditional monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Abuse or intentional misuse of fentanyl \nbuccal tablets may result in overdose and/or death.  \n \nEndocrine effects \nOpioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be \nseen include an increase in serum prolactin and decrease in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical \nsigns and symptoms may manifest from these hormonal changes. \n \nHyperalgesia \nAs with other opioids, in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, \nthe possibility of opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated. \n \nAnaphylaxis and hypersensitivity \nAnaphylaxis and hypersensitivity have been reported in association with the use of oral transmucosal \nfentanyl products (see Section 4.8). \n \nExcipient(s) \n \nSodium \n \nEffentora 100 micrograms buccal tablets \nThis medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per buccal tablet, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO \n\n\n\n8 \n\nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nEffentora 200  micrograms buccal tablets \nEffentora 400  micrograms buccal tablets \nEffentora 600  micrograms buccal tablets \nEffentora 800  micrograms buccal tablets \nThis medicinal product contains 20 mg sodium per per buccal tablet, equivalent to 1 % of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAgents that affect CYP3A4 activity \nFentanyl is metabolised mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), \ntherefore potential interactions may occur when Effentora is given concurrently with agents that affect \nCYP3A4 activity. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nCo-administration with agents that induce 3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of Effentora.  \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nThe concomitant use of Effentora with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., \namprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and \nverapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse \ndrug reactions including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving Effentora concomitantly with \nmoderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. \nDosage increase should be done with caution. \n \nAgents that can increase CNS depressant effects \nCo-administration of fentanyl with other central nervous system depressants, including other opioids, \nsedatives or hypnotics, (including benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, \ntranquillisers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines and alcohol can produce additive \ndepressant effects which may result in a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). \n \nSedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs \nThe concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs \nincreases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death because of additive CNS \ndepressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use should be limited (see section 4.4). \n \nPartial opioid agonists/antagonists \nThe concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, \npentazocine) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low \nintrinsic activity and therefore partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce \nwithdrawal symptoms in opioid dependant patients. \n \nSerotoninergic agents \nCo-administration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic agent, such as a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake \nInhibitor (SSRI) or a Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a Monoamine Oxidase \nInhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening \ncondition. Effentora is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOIs within 14 days \nbecause severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAOIs has been reported with opioid analgesics. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n\n\n\n9 \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Effentora \nshould not be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nWith long-term use of fentanyl during pregnancy, there is a risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal \nsyndrome which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management \naccording to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged \nperiod in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and \nensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see section 4.8). \n \nIt is advised not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) because \nfentanyl passes through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the foetus. If Effentora is \nadministered, an antidote for the child should be readily available. \n \nBreast-feeding \nFentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breast-fed \nchild. Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breastfeeding should not be restarted \nuntil at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl. \n \nFertility \nThere are no human data on fertility available. In animal studies, male fertility was impaired (See \nSection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nopioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially \ndangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Patients should be advised not to drive or \noperate machinery if they experience somnolence, dizziness, or visual disturbance while taking \nEffentora and not to drive or operate machinery until they know how they react. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nTypical opioid adverse reactions are to be expected with Effentora. Frequently, these will cease or \ndecrease in intensity with continued use of the medicinal product, as the patient is titrated to the most \nappropriate dose. However, the most serious adverse reactions are respiratory depression (potentially \nleading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension and shock and all patients \nshould be closely monitored for these. \n \nThe clinical studies of Effentora were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating BTP and all \npatients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal \nfentanyl, for their persistent pain. Therefore it is not possible to definitively separate the effects of \nEffentora alone. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with Effentora and/or other fentanyl-containing \ncompounds during clinical studies and post marketing experience. Adverse reactions are listed below \nas MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and frequency (frequencies are defined as: very \ncommon ≥1/10, common ≥1/100 to <1/10, uncommon ≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100, rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data); within each frequency group, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \n Very common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Oral candidiasis Pharyngitis Oral pustule  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n Very common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n Anaemia \nNeutropenia \n\nThrombocyto-\npenia \n\n  \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n   Hypersensitivit\ny* \n\n \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n   Hypogonadism Adrenal \ninsufficiency \nAndrogen \ndeficiency \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Anorexia    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Depression \nAnxiety \nConfusional \nstate \nInsomnia \n\nEuphoric \nmood  \nNervousness \nHallucination \nVisual \nhallucination \nMental status \nchanges \nDisorientation \n\n Drug \ndependence \n(addiction)* \nDrug abuse \n(see \nsection 4.4), \nDelirium \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nDizziness \nHeadache \n\nDysgeusia \nSomnolence \nLethargy \nTremor \nSedation \nHypoaesthesia  \nMigraine \n\nDepressed \nlevel of \nconsciousness \nDisturbance in \nattention \nBalance \ndisorder \nDysarthria \n\nCognitive \ndisorder \nMotor \ndysfunction \n\nLoss of \nconsciousness\n* \nConvulsion \n\nEye \ndisorders \n\n  Visual \ndisturbance \nOcular \nhyperaemia \nBlurred vision \nVisual acuity \nreduced \n\nAbnormal \nsensation in \neye \nPhotopsia \n \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n  Vertigo \nTinnitus \nEar discomfort \n\n  \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n Tachycardia Bradycardia   \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypotension \nHypertension \n\nFlushing \nHot flush \n\n  \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Dyspnoea  \nPharyngolaryn-\ngeal pain \n\nRespiratory \ndepression \nSleep apnoea \nsyndrome  \n\n Respiratory \narrest* \n\nGastro-\nintestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea  \nVomiting \n\nConstipation \nStomatitis \nDry mouth \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain  \nGastro-\noesophageal \n\nIleus \nMouth \nulceration \nOral \nhypoaesthesia \nOral \ndiscomfort \n\nOral mucosal \nblistering \nDry lip \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n Very common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \nreflux disease \nStomach \ndiscomfort \nDyspepsia \nToothache \n\nOral mucosal \ndiscolouration \nOral soft tissue \ndisorder \nGlossodynia \nTongue \nblistering \nGingival pain \nTongue \nulceration \nTongue \ndisorder \nOesophagitis \nChapped lips \nTooth disorder \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Biliary \ndilatation \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n Pruritus \nHyperhidrosis \nRash \n\nCold sweat \nFacial swelling \nGeneralised \npruritus \nAlopecia \n\nOnychorrhexis  \n\nMusculoskel\netal and \nconnective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n Myalgia  \nBack pain \n\nMuscle \ntwitching \nMuscular \nweakness \n\n  \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary \nretention \n \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nApplication \nsite reactions \nincluding \nbleeding, pain, \nulcer, \nirritation, \nparaesthesia, \nanaesthesia, \nerythema, \noedema, \nswelling and \nvesicles \n\nPeripheral \noedema  \nFatigue \nAsthenia \nDrug \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome* \nChills \n\nMalaise \nSluggishness \nChest \ndiscomfort \nFeeling \nabnormal \nFeeling jittery \nThirst \nFeeling cold \nFeeling hot \n \n\n Pyrexia \nNeonatal \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \n(see \nsection 4.6) \n\nInvestigations  Weight \ndecreased \n\nPlatelet count \ndecreased \nHeart rate \nincreased \nHaematocrit \ndecreased \nHaemoglobin \ndecreased \n\n  \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n Fall    \n\n* See section Description of selected adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nTolerance, physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration of \nopioids such as fentanyl (see section 4.4). \n \nOpioid withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor and sweating \nhave been observed with transmucosal fentanyl. \n \nLoss of consciousness and respiratory arrest have been observed in the context of overdose (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience, including rash, erythema, \nlip and face swelling, and urticaria (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThe symptoms of fentanyl overdose are expected to be similar in nature to those of intravenous \nfentanyl and other opioids, and are an extension of its pharmacological actions, with the most serious \nsignificant effects being altered mental status, loss of consciousness, hypotension, respiratory \ndepression, respiratory distress, and respiratory failure, which have resulted in death. \n \nManagement \n \nImmediate management of opioid overdose includes removal of the Effentora buccal tablet, if still in \nthe mouth, ensuring a patent airway, physical and verbal stimulation of the patient, assessment of the \nlevel of consciousness, ventilatory and circulatory status, and assisted ventilation (ventilatory support) \nif necessary. \n \nOverdose (accidental ingestion) in the opioid-naive person \nFor treatment of overdose (accidental ingestion) in the opioid-naive person, intravenous access should \nbe obtained and naloxone or other opioid antagonists should be employed as clinically indicated. The \nduration of respiratory depression following overdose may be longer than the effects of the opioid \nantagonist’s action (e.g., the half-life of naloxone ranges from 30 to 81 minutes) and repeated \nadministration may be necessary. Consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the individual \nopioid antagonist for details about such use. \n \nOverdose in opioid-maintained patients \nFor treatment of overdose in opioid-maintained patients, intravenous access should be obtained. The \njudicious use of naloxone or another opioid antagonist may be warranted in some instances, but it is \nassociated with the risk of precipitating an acute withdrawal syndrome. \n \nAlthough muscle rigidity interfering with respiration has not been seen following the use of Effentora, \nthis is possible with fentanyl and other opioids. If it occurs, it should be managed by the use of \nassisted ventilation, by an opioid antagonist, and as a final alternative, by a neuromuscular blocking \nagent. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: analgesics; opioids; ATC code N02AB03. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nFentanyl is an opioid analgesic, interacting predominantly with the opioid µ-receptor. Its primary \ntherapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Secondary pharmacological effects are respiratory \ndepression, bradycardia, hypothermia, constipation, miosis, physical dependence and euphoria. \n \nThe analgesic effects of fentanyl are related to its plasma level. In general, the effective concentration \nand the concentration at which toxicity occurs increase with increasing tolerance to opioids. The rate \nof development of tolerance varies widely among individuals. As a result, the dose of Effentora should \nbe individually titrated to achieve the desired effect (see section 4.2). \n \nAll opioid µ-receptor agonists, including fentanyl, produce dose dependent respiratory depression. The \nrisk of respiratory depression is less in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy as these patients will \ndevelop tolerance to respiratory depressant effects. \n \nOpioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or –gonadal axes. Some changes that can be \nseen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical \nsigns and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes (see also section 4.8). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and efficacy of Effentora have been evaluated in patients taking the drug at the onset of the \nbreakthrough pain episode. Pre-emptive use of Effentora for predictable pain episodes was not \ninvestigated in the clinical trials. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover studies \nhave been conducted involving a total of 248 patients with BTP and cancer who experienced on \naverage 1 to 4 episodes of BTP per day while taking maintenance opioid therapy. During an initial \nopen-label phase, patients were titrated to an effective dose of Effentora. Patients who identified an \neffective dose entered the double-blind phase of the study. The primary efficacy variable was the \npatient’s assessment of pain intensity. Patients assessed pain intensity on a 11-point scale. For each \nBTP episode, pain intensity was assessed prior to and at several time points after treatment. \n \nSixty-seven percent of the patients were able to be titrated to an effective dose. \n \nIn the pivotal clinical study (study 1), the primary endpoint was the average sum of differences in pain \nintensity scores from dosing to 60 minutes, inclusive (SPID60), which was statistically significant \ncompared to placebo (p<0.0001). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n \n\n \n \nIn the second pivotal study (study 2), the primary endpoint was SPID30, which was also statistically \nsignificant compared to placebo (p<0.0001). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nStatistically significant improvement in pain intensity difference was seen with Effentora versus \nplacebo as early as 10 minutes in Study 1 and as early as 15 minutes (earliest time point measured) in \nStudy 2. These differences continued to be significant at each subsequent time point in each individual \nstudy. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral introduction \nFentanyl is highly lipophilic and can be absorbed very rapidly through the oral mucosa and more \nslowly by the conventional gastrointestinal route. It is subject to first-pass hepatic and intestinal \nmetabolism and the metabolites do not contribute to fentanyl’s therapeutic effects. \n \nEffentora employs a delivery technology which utilises an effervescent reaction which enhances the \nrate and extent of fentanyl absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Transient pH changes accompanying \nthe effervescent reaction may optimise dissolution (at a lower pH) and membrane permeation (at a \nhigher pH).  \n \nDwell time (defined as the length of time that the tablet takes to fully disintegrate following buccal \nadministration), does not affect early systemic exposure to fentanyl. A comparison study between one \n400 mcg Effentora tablet administered either buccally (i.e., between the cheek and the gum) or \nsublingually met the criteria of bioequivalence. \n \nThe effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Effentora has not been studied. \n \nAbsorption: \nFollowing oromucosal administration of Effentora, fentanyl is readily absorbed with an absolute \nbioavailability of 65%. The absorption profile of Effentora is largely the result of an initial rapid \nabsorption from the buccal mucosa, with peak plasma concentrations following venous sampling \ngenerally attained within an hour after oromucosal administration. Approximately 50% of the total \ndose administered is rapidly absorbed transmucosally and becomes systemically available. The \nremaining half of the total dose is swallowed and slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. \nAbout 30% of the amount swallowed (50% of the total dose) escapes hepatic and intestinal first-pass \nelimination and becomes systemically available. \n \nThe main pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in the following table. \n \nPharmacokinetic Parameters* in Adult Subjects Receiving Effentora  \n \n\nPharmacokinetic \nparameter (mean) \n\nEffentora 400 micrograms \n \n\nAbsolute \nbioavailability \n \n\n65% (±20%) \n \n\nFraction \nabsorbed transmucosally \n \n\n48% (±31.8%) \n \n\nTmax (minute) ** \n \n\n46.8 (20-240) \n \n\nCmax (ng/ml) \n \n\n1.02 (± 0.42) \n \n\nAUC0-tmax (ng.hr/ml) \n \n\n0.40 (± 0.18) \n \n\nAUC0-inf (ng.hr/ml) \n \n\n6.48 (± 2.98) \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n*    Based on venous blood samples (plasma). Fentanyl concentrations obtained in serum were higher \nthan in plasma: Serum AUC and Cmax were approximately 20% and 30% higher than plasma AUC \nand Cmax, respectively. The reason of this difference is unknown.  \n** Data for Tmax presented as median (range). \n \nIn pharmacokinetic studies that compared the absolute and relative bioavailability of Effentora and \noral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC), the rate and extent of fentanyl absorption in Effentora \ndemonstrated exposure that was between 30% to 50% greater than that for oral transmucosal fentanyl \ncitrate. If switching from another oral fentanyl citrate product, independent dose titration with \nEffentora is required as bioavailability between products differs significantly. However, in these \npatients, a starting dose higher than 100 micrograms may be considered. \n \n\n \n \nDifferences in exposure with Effentora were observed in a clinical study with patients with grade 1 \nmucositis. Cmax and AUC0-8 were 1% and 25% higher in patients with mucositis compared to those \nwithout mucositis, respectively. The differences observed were not clinically significant. \n \nDistribution \nFentanyl is highly lipophilic and is well distributed beyond the vascular system, with a large apparent \nvolume of distribution. After buccal administration of Effentora, fentanyl undergoes initial rapid \ndistribution that represents an equilibration of fentanyl between plasma and the highly perfused tissues \n(brain, heart and lungs). Subsequently, fentanyl is redistributed between the deep tissue compartment \n(muscle and fat) and the plasma. \n \nThe plasma protein binding of fentanyl is 80% to 85%. The main binding protein is alpha-1-acid \nglycoprotein, but both albumin and lipoproteins contribute to some extent. The free fraction of \nfentanyl increases with acidosis. \n \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nTime after Dose Administration (hours) \n\nMean Plasma Concentration Versus Time \nProfiles Following Singles Doses of EFFENTORA and OTFC in Healthy Subjects \n\nPl\nas\n\nma\n F\n\nen\ntan\n\nyl \nCo\n\nnc\nen\n\ntra\ntio\n\nn (\nng\n\n/m\nL)\n\n \n\nOTFC data was dose adjusted (800 mcg to 400 mcg) \n\n400 mcg EFFENTORA \nOTFC (normalized to 400 mcg) \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nBiotransformation \nThe metabolic pathways following buccal administration of Effentora have not been characterised in \nclinical studies. Fentanyl is metabolised in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa to norfentanyl by \nCYP3A4 isoform. Norfentanyl is not pharmacologically active in animal studies. More than 90% of \nthe administered dose of fentanyl is eliminated by biotransformation to N-dealkylated and \nhydroxylated inactive metabolites. \n \nElimination \nFollowing the intravenous administration of fentanyl, less than 7% of the administered dose is \nexcreted unchanged in the urine, and only about 1% is excreted unchanged in the faeces. The \nmetabolites are mainly excreted in the urine, while faecal excretion is less important. \n \nFollowing the administration of Effentora, the terminal elimination phase of fentanyl is the result of \nthe redistribution between plasma and a deep tissue compartment. This phase of elimination is slow, \nresulting in a median terminal elimination half-life t1/2 of approximately 22 hours following buccal \nadministration of the effervescent formulation and approximately 18 hours following intravenous \nadministration. The total plasma clearance of fentanyl following intravenous administration is \napproximately 42 L/h. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nDose proportionality from 100 micrograms to 1000 micrograms has been demonstrated. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.  \n \n Embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies conducted in rats and rabbits revealed no compound-\ninduced malformations or developmental variations when administered during the period of \norganogenesis.   \n \nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect was observed at \nhigh doses (300 mcg/kg/day, s.c.) and is considered secondary to the sedative effects of fentanyl in \nanimal studies. \nIn studies on pre and postnatal development in rats the survival rate of offspring was significantly \nreduced at doses causing severe maternal toxicity. Further findings at maternally toxic doses in F1 \npups were delayed physical development, sensory functions, reflexes and behaviour. These effects \ncould either be indirect effects due to altered maternal care and/or decreased lactation rate or a direct \neffect of fentanyl on the pups. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year \nsubcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) with fentanyl did not reveal any findings indicative of \noncogenic potential. Evaluation of brain slides from the carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain \nlesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl citrate. The relevance of these findings to \nhumans is unknown. \n \n \n6.

What you need to knowbefore you use Effentora \n3. How to use Effentora \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Effentora \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Effentora is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance of Effentora is fentanyl citrate. Effentora is a pain-relieving medicine known as \nan opioid, which is used to treat breakthrough pain in adult patients with cancer who are already taking \nother opioid pain medicines for their persistent (around-the-clock) cancer pain. \nBreakthrough pain is additional, sudden pain that occurs in spite of you having taken your usual opioid \npain-relieving medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Effentora \n \nDo NOT use Effentora: \n• If you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, \n\nmorphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least a week, to control \nyour persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not use Effentora, \nbecause it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow and/or shallow, or \neven stop. \n\n• If you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n• If you suffer from severe breathing problems or severe obstructive lung conditions. \n• If you suffer from short-term pain other than breakthrough pain \n \nWarnings and precautions \nKeep using the opioid pain medicine you take for your persistent (around-the-clock) cancer pain \nduring your Effentora treatment. \nWhilst you are being treated with Effentora, do not use other fentanyl treatments previously prescribed \nfor your breakthrough pain. If you still have some of these fentanyl treatments at home, contact your \npharmacist to check how to dispose of them. \n\n\n\n42 \n\nRepeated use of the product may result in the drug being less effective (you become accustomed to it) \nor becoming dependent on it. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist BEFORE using Effentora if: \n• Your other opioid pain medicine taken for your persistent (around-the-clock) cancer pain is not \n\nstabilised yet. \n• You are suffering from any condition that has an effect on your breathing (such as asthma, \n\nwheezing, or shortness of breath). \n• You have a head injury. \n• You have an exceptionally slow heart rate or other heart problems. \n• You have liver or kidney problems, as these organs have an effect on the way in which your \n\nsystem breaks down the medicine. \n• You have low amount of fluid in the circulation or low blood pressure. \n• You are over 65 years old - you may need a lower dose and any dose increase will be reviewed \n\nvery carefully by your doctor. \n• You have problems with your heart especially slow heart rate. \n• You use benzodiazepines (see section 2 under “Other medicines and Effentora”). Using \n\nbenzodiazepines can increase the chances of getting serious side effects including death \n• You use antidepressants or antipsychotics (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors; see \nsection 2 under “Do not use Effentora” and “Other medicines and Effentora”)The use of these \nmedicines with Effentora can lead to a serotonin syndrome a potentially life-threatening \ncondition (see section 2 under “Other medicines and Effentora”). \n\n• You have ever developed adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the adrenal glands do not \nproduce enough hormones or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) with opioid use (see \nsection 4 under “Serious side effects”). \n\n• You have ever abused or been dependent on opioids or any other drug, alcohol or illegal drugs. \n• You drink alcohol; please refer to section Effentora with food, drink and alcohol. \n \nConsult your doctor WHILE using Effentora if: \n• You experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a \n\nhigher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. \n• You experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, \n\nweakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a \npotentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the adrenal \nglands do not produce enough hormones. \n\n \nSeek URGENT medical advice if: \n• You experience symptoms such as difficulty in breathing or dizziness, swelling of the tongue, lip \n\nor throat while using Effentora. These might be early symptoms of a serious allergic reaction \n(anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity; see section 4 under “Serious side effects”) \n\n \nWhat to do if someone accidentally takes Effentora \nIf you think someone has accidentally taken Effentora please seek immediate medical assistance. Try \nto keep the person awake until emergency help arrives. \n \nIf someone has accidentally taken Effentora, they may have the same side effects as described in the \nsection 3 “If you use more Effentora than you should”. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Effentora \nTell your doctor or pharmacist before starting Effentora if you are taking or have recently taken or \nmight take any of the following medicines: \n\n\n\n43 \n\n• Concomitant use of Effentora and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs \nincreases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), coma and may \nbe life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should only be considered when other \ntreatment options are not possible.  \n\n However if your doctor does prescribe Effentora together with sedative medicines the dose and \nduration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor.  \n\n Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking (such as sleeping pills, \nmedicines to treat anxiety, some medicines to treat allergic reactions (antihistamines), or \ntranquillisers) and follow your doctor’s dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to \ninform friends or relatives to be aware of the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your \ndoctor when experiencing such symptoms. \n\n• Some muscle relaxants - such as baclofen, diazepam (see also section “Warnings and \nprecautions”. \n\n• Any medicines that might have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down Effentora, \nsuch as ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and fosamprenavir (medicines that help control HIV \ninfection) or other so-called CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole \n(used for treatment of fungal infections), troleandomycine, clarithromycine, or erythromycine \n(medicines for treatment of bacterial infections), aprepitant (used for severe nausea) and diltiazem \nand verapamil (medicines for treatment of high blood pressure or heart diseases). \n\n• Medicines called monoamine-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used for severe depression) or have done \nso in the past 2 weeks. \n\n• Certain type of strong pain killers, calledpartial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine \nand pentazocine (medicines for treatment of pain). You could experience symptoms of withdrawal \nsyndrom (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating) while using these \nmedicines. \n\n• The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or \nantipsychotics. Effentora may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental status \nchanges (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature above \n38°C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, muscular \nrigidity, lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). \nYour doctor will tell you whether Effentora is suitable for you. \n\n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nEffentora with food, drink and alcohol \n• Effentora may be used before or after, but not during, meals. You may drink some water before \n\nusing Effentora to help moisten your mouth, but you should not drink or eat anything while taking \nthe medicine.  \n\n• You should not drink grapefruit juice while using Effentora because it may affect the way your \nbody breaks down Effentora. \n\n• Do not drink alcohol while using Effentora. It can increase the risk of experiencing serious side \neffects including death. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nEffentora should not be used during pregnancy unless you have discussed this with your doctor. \nIf Effentora is used for a long time during pregnancy, there is also a risk of the new-born child having \nwithdrawal symptoms which might be life-threatening if not recognized and treated by a doctor. \n \nYou should not use Effentora during childbirth because fentanyl may cause respiratory depression in \nthe new-born child.  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nFentanyl can get into breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed infant. Do not use \nEffentora if you are breast-feeding. You should not start breast-feeding until at least 5 days after the \nlast dose of Effentora. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou should discuss with your doctor whether it is safe for you to drive, or operate machinery after \ntaking Effentora. Do not drive or operate machinery if you: are feeling sleepy or dizzy; have blurred or \ndouble vision; or have difficulty in concentrating. It is important you know how you react to Effentora \nbefore driving or operating machinery. \n \nEffentora contains sodium \n \nEffentora 100 micrograms \nThis medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each buccal tablet. \nThis is equivalent to 0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nEffentora 200 micrograms, Effentora 400 micrograms, Effentora 600 micrograms, \nEffentora 800 micrograms \nThis medicine contains 20 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each buccal tablet. \nThis is equivalent to 1 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How to use Effentora \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nDosage and frequency \nWhen you first start using Effentora, your doctor will work with you to find the dose that will relieve \nyour breakthrough pain. It is very important that you use Effentora exactly as the doctor tells you The \ninitial dose is 100 micrograms. During determination of your right dose, your doctor may instruct you \nto take more than one tablet per episode. If your breakthrough pain is not relieved after 30 minutes, \nuse only 1 more tablet of Effentora during the titration period. \n \nOnce the right dose has been determined with your doctor, use 1 tablet for an episode of breakthrough \npain as a general rule. In the further course of treatment your requirement for analgesic therapy may \nchange. Higher doses may be necessary. If your breakthrough pain is not relieved after 30 minutes, use \nonly 1 more tablet of Effentora during this dose-readjustment period. \nContact your doctor if your right dose of Effentora does not relieve your breakthrough pain. Your \ndoctor will decide if your dose needs to be changed. \n \nWait at least 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with Effentora. \n \nYou must let your doctor know immediately if you are using Effentora more than four times per day, \nas a change may be required to your treatment regimen. Your doctor may change the treatment for \nyour persistent pain; when your persistent pain is controlled, your doctor may need to change the dose \nof Effentora. If your doctor suspects Effentora-related increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia), a \nreduction of your Effentora dose may be considered (see section 2 under “Warnings and precautions”). \nFor the most effective relief, let your doctor know about your pain and how Effentora is working for \nyou, so that the dose can be changed if needed. \n \nDo not change doses of Effentora or your other pain medicines on your own. Any change in dosage \nmust be prescribed and monitored by your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nIf you are not sure about the right dose, or if you have questions about taking this medicine, you \nshould contact your doctor. \n \nMethod of administration \nEffentora buccal tablets are for oromucosal use. When you place a tablet in your mouth, it dissolves \nand the medicine is absorbed through the lining of your mouth, into the blood system. Taking the \nmedicine in this way allows it to be absorbed quickly to relieve your breakthrough pain. \n \nTaking the medicine \n• Open the blister only when you are ready to use the tablet. The tablet must be used immediately \n\nonce removed from the blister. \n• Separate one of the blister units from the blister card by tearing apart at the perforations. \n• Bend the blister unit along the line where indicated. \n• Peel the blister backing to expose the tablet. Do NOT attempt to push the tablet through the blister, \n\nbecause this can damage the tablet. \n\n \n \n• Remove the tablet from the blister unit and immediately place the entire tablet near a molar tooth \n\nbetween the gum and the cheek (as shown in the picture). Sometimes, your doctor may tell you to \nplace the tablet under your tongue instead. \n\n• Do not attempt to crush or split the tablet. \n\n \n \n• Do not bite, suck, chew, or swallow the tablet, as this will result in less pain relief than when taken \n\nas directed. \n• The tablet should be left between the cheek and gum until dissolved, which usually takes \n\napproximately 14 to 25 minutes. \n• You may feel a gentle bubbling sensation between your cheek and gum as the tablet dissolves. \n• In case of irritation, you may change the placement of the tablet on the gum. \n• After 30 minutes, if pieces of the tablet remain, they may be swallowed with a glass of water. \n \nIf you use more Effentora than you should \n• The most common side effects are feeling sleepy, sick or dizzy. If you begin to feel very dizzy, or \n\nvery sleepy before the tablet is completely dissolved, rinse your mouth with water and spit the \nremaining pieces of the tablet into a sink or toilet right away. \n\n• A serious side effect of Effentora is slow and/or shallow breathing. This can occur if your dose of \nEffentora is too high or if you take too much Effentora. If this occurs, please seek immediate \nmedical assistance. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Effentora \nIf the breakthrough pain is still ongoing, you may take Effentora as prescribed by your physician. If \nthe breakthrough pain has stopped, do not take Effentora until the next breakthrough pain episode. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nIf you stop using Effentora \nYou should discontinue Effentora when you no longer have any breakthrough pain. You must \nhowever continue to take your usual opioid pain relieving medicine to treat your persistent cancer pain \nas advised by your doctor. You may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to the possible side \neffects of Effentora when discontinuing Effentora. If you experience withdrawal symptoms or if you \nare concerned about your pain relief, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will evaluate if you \nneed medicine to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. If you \nnotice any of these, contact your doctor.  \n \nSerious side effects \n \n• The most serious side effects are shallow breathing, low blood pressure and shock. \n\nEffentora like other fentanyl products can cause very severe breathing problems which can \nlead to death. If you become very sleepy or have slow and/or shallow breathing, you or your \ncarer should contact your doctor immediately and call for emergency help. \n\n \n• Contact your doctor immediately if you experience a combination of the following \n\nsymptoms \n- Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure \n\nTogether these symptoms may be a sign of a potentially life-threatening condition called adrenal \ninsufficiency.
