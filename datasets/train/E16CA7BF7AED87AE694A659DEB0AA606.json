CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nInlyta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after \nfailure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Inlyta should be conducted by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer \ntherapies. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of axitinib is 5 mg twice daily.  \n \nTreatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity \noccurs that cannot be managed by concomitant medicinal products or dose adjustments. \n \nIf the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken. The next prescribed \ndose should be taken at the usual time. \n \nDose adjustments \n \nDose increase or reduction is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. \n \nPatients who tolerate the axitinib starting dose of 5 mg twice daily with no adverse reactions \n> Grade 2 (i.e. without severe adverse reactions according to the Common Terminology Criteria for \nAdverse Events [CTCAE] version 3.0) for two consecutive weeks may have their dose increased to \n7 mg twice daily unless the patient\u2019s blood pressure is > 150/90 mmHg or the patient is receiving \nantihypertensive treatment. Subsequently, using the same criteria, patients who tolerate an axitinib \ndose of 7 mg twice daily may have their dose increased to a maximum of 10 mg twice daily. \n \nManagement of some adverse reactions may require temporary or permanent discontinuation and/or \ndose reduction of axitinib therapy (see section 4.4). When dose reduction is necessary, the axitinib \ndose may be reduced to 3 mg twice daily and further to 2 mg twice daily. \n \nDose adjustment is not required on the basis of patient age, race, gender, or body weight. \n \nConcomitant strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors \nCo-administration of axitinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors may increase axitinib plasma \nconcentrations (see section 4.5). Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or \nminimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended.  \n \nAlthough axitinib dose adjustment has not been studied in patients receiving strong \nCYP3A4/5 inhibitors, if a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, a dose decrease of \naxitinib to approximately half the dose (e.g. the starting dose should be reduced from 5 mg twice \n\n\n\n4 \n\ndaily to 2 mg twice daily) is recommended. Management of some adverse reactions may require \ntemporary or permanent discontinuation of axitinib therapy (see section 4.4). If co-administration of \nthe strong inhibitor is discontinued, a return to the axitinib dose used prior to initiation of the strong \nCYP3A4/5 inhibitor should be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant strong CYP3A4/5 inducers \nCo-administration of axitinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers may decrease axitinib plasma \nconcentrations (see section 4.5). Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or \nminimal CYP3A4/5 induction potential is recommended.  \n \nAlthough axitinib dose adjustment has not been studied in patients receiving strong \nCYP3A4/5 inducers, if a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer must be co-administered, a gradual dose \nincrease of axitinib is recommended. Maximal induction with high-dose strong CYP3A4/5 inducers \nhas been reported to occur within one week of treatment with the inducer. If the dose of axitinib is \nincreased, the patient should be monitored carefully for toxicity. Management of some adverse \nreactions may require temporary or permanent discontinuation and/or dose reduction of axitinib \ntherapy (see section 4.4). If co-administration of the strong inducer is discontinued, the axitinib \ndose should be immediately returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4/5 \ninducer (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). Virtually no data are available regarding axitinib \ntreatment in patients with a creatinine clearance of < 15 mL/min. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required when administering axitinib to patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh class A). A dose decrease is recommended when administering axitinib to patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) (e.g. the starting dose should be reduced from \n5 mg twice daily to 2 mg twice daily). Axitinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class C) and should not be used in this population (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Inlyta in children and adolescents < 18 years have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAxitinib is for oral use. The tablets should be taken orally twice daily approximately 12 hours apart \nwith or without food (see section 5.2). They should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to axitinib or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSpecific safety events should be monitored before initiation of, and periodically throughout, \ntreatment with axitinib as described below. \n \nCardiac failure events \nIn clinical studies with axitinib for the treatment of patients with RCC, cardiac failure events \n(including cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiopulmonary failure, left ventricular \ndysfunction, ejection fraction decreased, and right ventricular failure) were reported (see section \n4.8).  \n \nSigns or symptoms of cardiac failure should periodically be monitored throughout treatment with \naxitinib. Management of cardiac failure events may require temporary interruption or permanent \ndiscontinuation and/or dose reduction of axitinib therapy. \n \nHypertension \nIn clinical studies with axitinib for the treatment of patients with RCC, hypertension was very \ncommonly reported (see section 4.8). \n \nIn a controlled clinical study, the median onset time for hypertension (systolic blood pressure \n> 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg) was within the first month of the start of \naxitinib treatment and blood pressure increases have been observed as early as 4 days after starting \naxitinib.  \n \nBlood pressure should be well-controlled prior to initiating axitinib. Patients should be monitored for \nhypertension and treated as needed with standard antihypertensive therapy. In the case of persistent \nhypertension, despite use of antihypertensive medicinal products, the axitinib dose should be \nreduced. For patients who develop severe hypertension, temporarily interrupt axitinib and restart at \na lower dose once the patient is normotensive. If axitinib is interrupted, patients receiving \nantihypertensive medicinal products should be monitored for hypotension (see section 4.2). \n \nIn case of severe or persistent arterial hypertension and symptoms suggestive of posterior reversible \nencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (see below), a diagnostic brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) \nshould be considered. \n \nThyroid dysfunction \nIn clinical studies with axitinib for the treatment of patients with RCC, events of hypothyroidism \nand, to a lesser extent, hyperthyroidism, were reported (see section 4.8).  \n \nThyroid function should be monitored before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment \nwith axitinib. Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should be treated according to standard medical \npractice to maintain euthyroid state. \n \nArterial embolic and thrombotic events \nIn clinical studies with axitinib, arterial embolic and thrombotic events (including transient ischemic \nattack, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and retinal artery occlusion) were reported \n(see section 4.8). \n \nAxitinib should be used with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these \nevents. Axitinib has not been studied in patients who had an arterial embolic or thrombotic event \nwithin the previous 12 months.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nVenous embolic and thrombotic events \nIn clinical studies with axitinib, venous embolic and thrombotic events (including pulmonary \nembolism, deep vein thrombosis, and retinal vein occlusion/thrombosis) were reported (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \nAxitinib should be used with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these \nevents. Axitinib has not been studied in patients who had a venous embolic or thrombotic event \nwithin the previous 6 months. \n \nElevation of haemoglobin or haematocrit \nIncreases in haemoglobin or haematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may occur \nduring treatment with axitinib (see section 4.8, polycythaemia). An increase in red blood cell mass \nmay increase the risk of embolic and thrombotic events. \n \nHaemoglobin or haematocrit should be monitored before initiation of, and periodically throughout, \ntreatment with axitinib. If haemoglobin or haematocrit becomes elevated above the normal level, \npatients should be treated according to standard medical practice to decrease haemoglobin or \nhaematocrit to an acceptable level. \n \nHaemorrhage \nIn clinical studies with axitinib, haemorrhagic events were reported (see section 4.8).  \n \nAxitinib has not been studied in patients who have evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent \nactive gastrointestinal bleeding, and should not be used in those patients. If any bleeding requires \nmedical intervention, temporarily interrupt the axitinib dose.  \n \nAneurysms and artery dissections \nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Inlyta, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n \nGastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation \nIn clinical studies with axitinib, events of gastrointestinal perforation and fistulas were reported (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \nSymptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula should be periodically monitored for throughout \ntreatment with axitinib. \n \nWound healing complications \nNo formal studies of the effect of axitinib on wound healing have been conducted.  \n \nTreatment with axitinib should be stopped at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery. The decision \nto resume axitinib therapy after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound \nhealing. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \nIn clinical studies with axitinib, events of PRES were reported (see section 4.8).  \n \nPRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, \nblindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. \nMagnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES. In patients with signs \nor symptoms of PRES, temporarily interrupt or permanently discontinue axitinib treatment. The \nsafety of reinitiating axitinib therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nProteinuria \nIn clinical studies with axitinib, proteinuria, including that of Grade 3 and 4 severity, was reported \n(see section 4.8).  \n \nMonitoring for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with axitinib is \nrecommended. For patients who develop moderate to severe proteinuria, reduce the dose or \ntemporarily interrupt axitinib treatment (see section 4.2). Axitinib should be discontinued if the \npatient develops nephrotic syndrome. \n \nLiver-related adverse reactions \nIn a controlled clinical study with axitinib for the treatment of patients with RCC, liver-related \nadverse reactions were reported. The most commonly reported liver-related adverse reactions \nincluded increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood \nbilirubin (see section 4.8). No concurrent elevations of ALT (> 3 times the upper limit of normal \n[ULN]) and bilirubin (> 2 times the ULN) were observed. \n \nIn a clinical dose-finding study, concurrent elevations of ALT (12 times the ULN) and bilirubin \n(2.3 times the ULN), considered to be drug-related hepatotoxicity, were observed in 1 patient who \nreceived axitinib at a starting dose of 20 mg twice daily (4 times the recommended starting dose). \n \nLiver function tests should be monitored before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment \nwith axitinib. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn clinical studies with axitinib, the systemic exposure to axitinib was approximately two-fold higher \nin subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) compared to subjects with \nnormal hepatic function. A dose decrease is recommended when administering axitinib to patients \nwith moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) (see section 4.2). \n \nAxitinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) and \nshould not be used in this population.  \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) and race \nIn a controlled clinical study with axitinib for the treatment of patients with RCC, 34% of patients \ntreated with axitinib were \u2265 65 years of age. The majority of patients were White (77%) or \nAsian (21%). Although greater sensitivity to develop adverse reactions in some older patients and \nAsian patients cannot be ruled out, overall, no major differences were observed in the safety and \neffectiveness of axitinib between patients who were \u2265 65 years of age and non-elderly, and between \nWhite patients and patients of other races. \n \nNo dosage adjustment is required on the basis of patient age or race (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nLactose \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro data indicate that axitinib is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4/5 and, to a lesser extent, \nCYP1A2, CYP2C19, and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nCYP3A4/5 inhibitors \nKetoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, administered at a dose of 400 mg once daily for \n7 days, increased the mean area under the curve (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax 1.5-fold of a single 5-mg \noral dose of axitinib in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of axitinib with strong CYP3A4/5 \ninhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, \nnefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin) may increase axitinib plasma \nconcentrations. Grapefruit may also increase axitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of \nconcomitant medicinal products with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended. \nIf a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, a dose adjustment of axitinib is \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n \nCYP1A2 and CYP2C19 inhibitors \nCYP1A2 and CYP2C19 constitute minor (< 10%) pathways in axitinib metabolism. The effect of \nstrong inhibitors of these isozymes on axitinib pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Caution \nshould be exercised due to the risk of increased axitinib plasma concentrations in patients taking \nstrong inhibitors of these isozymes. \n \nCYP3A4/5 inducers \nRifampicin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4/5, administered at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 9 days, \nreduced the mean AUC by 79% and Cmax by 71% of a single 5 mg dose of axitinib in healthy \nvolunteers.  \n \nCo-administration of axitinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, dexamethasone, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and Hypericum perforatum [St. \nJohn\u2019s wort]) may decrease axitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of concomitant medicinal \nproducts with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 induction potential is recommended. If a strong CYP3A4/5 \ninducer must be co-administered, a dose adjustment of axitinib is recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn vitro studies of CYP and UGT inhibition and induction \nIn vitro studies indicated that axitinib does not inhibit CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, \nCYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, or UGT1A1 at therapeutic plasma concentrations.  \n \nIn vitro studies indicated that axitinib has a potential to inhibit CYP1A2. Therefore, co-\nadministration of axitinib with CYP1A2 substrates may result in increased plasma concentrations of \nCYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline).  \n \nIn vitro studies also indicated that axitinib has the potential to inhibit CYP2C8. However, \nco-administration of axitinib with paclitaxel, a known CYP2C8 substrate, did not result in increased \nplasma concentrations of paclitaxel in patients with advanced cancer, indicating lack of clinical \nCYP2C8 inhibition.  \n \nIn vitro studies in human hepatocytes also indicated that axitinib does not induce CYP1A1, \nCYP1A2, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore co-administration of axitinib is not expected to reduce the \nplasma concentration of co-administered CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP3A4/5 substrates in vivo. \n \nIn vitro studies with P-glycoprotein \nIn vitro studies indicated that axitinib inhibits P-glycoprotein. However, axitinib is not expected to \ninhibit P-glycoprotein at therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therefore, co-administration of axitinib \nis not expected to increase the plasma concentration of digoxin, or other P-glycoprotein substrates, \nin vivo. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data regarding the use of axitinib in pregnant women. Based on the pharmacological \nproperties of axitinib, it may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity including malformations (see section 5.3). Axitinib should \nnot be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with \nthis medicinal product. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 1 week after \ntreatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether axitinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be \nexcluded. Axitinib should not be used during breast-feeding.  \n \nFertility \nBased on non-clinical findings, axitinib has the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility \nin humans (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAxitinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised that \nthey may experience events such as dizziness and/or fatigue during treatment with axitinib. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe following risks, including appropriate action to be taken, are discussed in greater detail in \nsection 4.4: cardiac failure events, hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, arterial thromboembolic \nevents, venous thromboembolic events, elevation of haemoglobin or haematocrit, haemorrhage, \ngastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation, wound healing complications, PRES, proteinuria, \nand elevation of liver enzymes. \n \nThe most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions observed following treatment with axitinib were \ndiarrhoea, hypertension, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, weight decreased, dysphonia, \npalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (hand-foot) syndrome, haemorrhage, hypothyroidism, vomiting, \nproteinuria, cough, and constipation. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 presents adverse reactions reported in a pooled dataset of 672 patients who received axitinib \nin clinical studies for the treatment of patients with RCC (see section 5.1). Post-marketing adverse \nreactions identified in clinical studies are also included. \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class, frequency category and grade of severity. \nFrequency categories are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE17 \n \nMechanism of action \nAxitinib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor \nreceptors (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. These receptors are implicated in pathologic \nangiogenesis, tumour growth, and metastatic progression of cancer. Axitinib has been shown to \npotently inhibit VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation and survival. Axitinib inhibited the \nphosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in xenograft tumour vasculature that expressed the target in vivo and \nproduced tumour growth delay, regression, and inhibition of metastases in many experimental \nmodels of cancer. \n \nEffect on QTc interval \nIn a randomised, 2-way crossover study, 35 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose \nof axitinib (5 mg) in the absence and presence of 400 mg ketoconazole for 7 days. Results of this \nstudy indicated that axitinib plasma exposures up to two-fold greater than therapeutic levels \nexpected following a 5 mg dose, did not produce clinically-significant QT interval prolongation. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and efficacy of axitinib were evaluated in a randomised, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 \nstudy. Patients (N = 723) with advanced RCC whose disease had progressed on or after treatment \nwith one prior systemic therapy, including sunitinib-, bevacizumab-, temsirolimus-, or cytokine-\ncontaining regimens were randomised (1:1) to receive axitinib (N = 361) or sorafenib (N = 362). \nThe primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), was assessed using a blinded independent \ncentral review. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival \n(OS).  \n \nOf the patients enrolled in this study, 389 patients (53.8%) had received one prior sunitinib-based \ntherapy, 251 patients (34.7%) had received one prior cytokine-based therapy (interleukin-2 or \ninterferon-alpha), 59 patients (8.2%) had received one prior bevacizumab-based therapy, and \n24 patients (3.3%) had received one prior temsirolimus-based therapy. The baseline demographic \nand disease characteristics were similar between the axitinib and sorafenib groups with regard to \nage, gender, race, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, geographic \nregion, and prior treatment. \n \nIn the overall patient population and the two main subgroups (prior sunitinib treatment and prior \ncytokine treatment), there was a statistically significant advantage for axitinib over sorafenib for the \nprimary endpoint of PFS (see Table 2 and Figures 1, 2 and 3). The magnitude of median PFS effect \nwas different in the subgroups by prior therapy. Two of the subgroups were too small to give \nreliable results (prior temsirolimus treatment or prior bevacizumab treatment). There were no \nstatistically significant differences between the arms in OS in the overall population or in the \nsubgroups by prior therapy. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 2.

Kaplan-Meier curve of progression-free survival by independent assessment for \nthe prior cytokine subgroup \n\n \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \naxitinib in all subsets of the paediatric population for treatment of kidney and renal pelvis carcinoma \n(excluding nephroblastoma, nephroblastomatosis, clear cell sarcoma, mesoblastic nephroma, renal \nmedullary carcinoma and rhabdoid tumour of the kidney) (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration of axitinib tablets, the mean absolute bioavailability is 58% compared to \nintravenous administration. The plasma half life of axitinib ranges from 2.5 to 6.1 hours. Dosing of \naxitinib at 5 mg twice daily resulted in less than two-fold accumulation compared to administration \nof a single dose. Based on the short half-life of axitinib, steady state is expected within 2 to 3 days \nof the initial dose. \n \nAbsorption and distribution \nPeak axitinib concentrations in plasma are generally reached within 4 hours following oral \nadministration of axitinib with median Tmax ranging from 2.5 to 4.1 hours. Administration of axitinib \nwith a moderate fat meal resulted in 10% lower exposure compared to overnight fasting. A high fat, \nhigh-calorie meal resulted in 19% higher exposure compared to overnight fasting. Axitinib may be \nadministered with or without food (see section 4.2). \n \nThe average Cmax and AUC increased proportionally over an axitinib dosing range of 5 to 10 mg. \nIn vitro binding of axitinib to human plasma proteins is > 99% with preferential binding to albumin \nand moderate binding to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. At the 5 mg twice daily dose in the fed state, the \ngeometric mean peak plasma concentration and 24-hour AUC were 27.8 ng/mL and 265 ng.h/mL, \nrespectively, in patients with advanced RCC. The geometric mean oral clearance and apparent \nvolume of distribution were 38 L/h and 160 L, respectively. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nAxitinib is metabolised primarily in the liver by CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, \nCYP2C19, and UGT1A1. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nFollowing oral administration of a 5 mg radioactive dose of axitinib, 30-60% of the radioactivity \nwas recovered in faeces and 23% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. Unchanged axitinib, \naccounting for 12% of the dose, was the major component identified in faeces. Unchanged axitinib \nwas not detected in urine; the carboxylic acid and sulfoxide metabolites accounted for the majority \nof radioactivity in urine. In plasma, the N-glucuronide metabolite represented the predominant \nradioactive component (50% of circulating radioactivity) and unchanged axitinib and the sulfoxide \nmetabolite each accounted for approximately 20% of the circulating radioactivity. \n \nThe sulfoxide and N-glucuronide metabolites show approximately 400-fold and 8000-fold less in \nvitro potency, respectively, against VEGFR-2 compared to axitinib. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly, gender, and race \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with advanced cancer (including advanced RCC) \nand healthy volunteers indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, body \nweight, race, renal function, UGT1A1 genotype, or CYP2C19 genotype. \n \nPaediatric population \nAxitinib has not been studied in patients < 18 years of age.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn vitro and in vivo data indicate that axitinib is primarily metabolised by the liver. \n \nCompared to subjects with normal hepatic function, systemic exposure following a single dose of \naxitinib was similar in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) and higher \n(approximately two-fold) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). \nAxitinib has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) and \nshould not be used in this population (see section 4.2 for dose adjustment recommendations). \n \nRenal impairment \nUnchanged axitinib is not detected in the urine.  \n \nAxitinib has not been studied in subjects with renal impairment. In clinical studies with axitinib for \nthe treatment of patients with RCC, patients with serum creatinine > 1.5 times the ULN or \ncalculated creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min were excluded. Population pharmacokinetic analyses \nhave shown that axitinib clearance was not altered in subjects with renal impairment and no dose \nadjustment of axitinib is required. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat dose toxicity \nMajor toxicity findings in mice and dogs following repeated dosing for up to 9 months were the \ngastrointestinal, haematopoietic, reproductive, skeletal and dental systems, with No Observed \nAdverse Effect Levels (NOAEL) approximately equivalent to or below expected human exposure at \nthe recommended clinical starting dose (based on AUC levels). \n \nCarcinogenicity \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with axitinib. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nGenotoxicity \nAxitinib was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays in vitro. A significant \nincrease in polyploidy was observed in vitro at concentrations > 0.22 \u00b5g/mL, and an elevation in \nmicronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in vivo with No Observed Effect Level \n(NOEL) 69-fold the expected human exposure. Genotoxicity findings are not considered clinically \nrelevant at exposure levels observed in humans. \n \nReproduction toxicity \nAxitinib-related findings in the testes and epididymis included decreased organ weight, atrophy or \ndegeneration, decreased numbers of germinal cells, hypospermia or abnormal sperm forms, and \nreduced sperm density and count. These findings were observed in mice at exposure levels \napproximately 12-fold the expected human exposure, and in dogs at exposure levels below the \nexpected human exposure. There was no effect on mating or fertility in male mice at exposure \nlevels approximately 57-fold the expected human exposure. Findings in females included signs of \ndelayed sexual maturity, reduced or absent corpora lutea, decreased uterine weights and uterine \natrophy at exposures approximately equivalent to the expected human exposure. Reduced fertility \nand embryonic viability were observed in female mice at all doses tested, with exposure levels at the \nlowest dose approximately 10-fold the expected human exposure. \n \nPregnant mice exposed to axitinib showed an increased occurrence of cleft palate malformations \nand skeletal variations, including delayed ossification, at exposure levels below the expected human \nexposure. Perinatal and postnatal developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted.  \n \nToxicity findings in immature animals \nReversible physeal dysplasia was observed in mice and dogs given axitinib for at least 1 month at \nexposure levels approximately six-fold higher than the expected human exposure. Partially reversible \ndental caries were observed in mice treated for more than 1 month at exposure levels similar to the \nexpected human exposure. Other toxicities of potential concern to paediatric patients have not been \nevaluated in juvenile animals. \n \n \n6.

Therefore, the product information \nshould be updated to include cholecystitis as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 of \nthe PL, with frequency \u2018common\u2019.  \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for axitinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing axitinib is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
