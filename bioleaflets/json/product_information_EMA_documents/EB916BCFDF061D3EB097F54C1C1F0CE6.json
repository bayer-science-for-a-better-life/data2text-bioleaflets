This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXarelto 2.5 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 2.5 mg rivaroxaban.  \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach film-coated tablet contains 33.92 mg lactose (as monohydrate), see section 4.4. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet)  \n \nLight yellow, round biconvex tablets (6 mm diameter, 9 mm radius of curvature) marked with the \nBAYER-cross on one side and \"2.5\" and a triangle on the other side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an acute \ncoronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nXarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of \natherothrombotic events in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or symptomatic \nperipheral artery disease (PAD) at high risk of ischaemic events. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily.  \n \n• ACS \nPatients taking Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of 75 - 100 mg ASA or a daily \ndose of 75 - 100 mg ASA in addition to either a daily dose of 75 mg clopidogrel or a standard daily \ndose of ticlopidine. \n \nTreatment should be regularly evaluated in the individual patient weighing the risk for ischaemic \nevents against the bleeding risks. Extension of treatment beyond 12 months should be done on an \nindividual patient basis as experience up to 24 months is limited (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n \n\nTreatment with Xarelto should be started as soon as possible after stabilisation of the ACS event \n(including revascularisation procedures); at the earliest 24 hours after admission to hospital and at the \ntime when parenteral anticoagulation therapy would normally be discontinued. \n \n• CAD/PAD \nPatients taking Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of 75 - 100 mg ASA. \n \nDuration of treatment should be determined for each individual patient based on regular evaluations \nand should consider the risk for thrombotic events versus the bleeding risks. \n \nIn patients with an acute thrombotic event or vascular procedure and a need for dual antiplatelet \ntherapy, the continuation of Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily should be evaluated depending on the type of \nevent or procedure and antiplatelet regimen. Safety and efficacy of Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily in \ncombination with ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine has only been studied in patients with recent ACS \n(see section 4.1). Dual antiplatelet therapy has not been studied in combination with Xarelto 2.5 mg \ntwice daily in patients with CAD/PAD (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should continue with the regular dose as recommended at the next \nscheduled time. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, International Normalised Ratio (INR) values could \nbe falsely elevated after the intake of Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant \nactivity of Xarelto, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR.  \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is ≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the parenteral \nmedicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of discontinuation \nof a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto dose would be taken.  \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 -\n 80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n \n\nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population  \nNo dose adjustment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \nThe risk of bleeding increases with increasing age (see section 4.4). \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. Therefore, Xarelto is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nXarelto is for oral use. \nThe tablets can be taken with or without food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally.  \nThe crushed Xarelto tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of the correct \ngastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount of water \nvia a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant treatment of ACS with antiplatelet therapy in patients with a prior stroke or a transient \nischaemic attack (TIA) (see section 4.4).  \n \nConcomitant treatment of CAD/PAD with ASA in patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar \nstroke, or any stroke within a month (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n5 \n \n \n\n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn ACS patients, efficacy and safety of Xarelto 2.5 mg have been investigated in combination with the \nantiplatelet agents ASA alone or ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine. Treatment in combination with \nother antiplatelet agents, e.g. prasugrel or ticagrelor, has not been studied and is not recommended. \nIn patients at high risk of ischaemic events with CAD/PAD, efficacy and safety of Xarelto 2.5 mg \nhave only been investigated in combination with ASA.  \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment on top of single or dual anti-platelet therapy. Thus, in addition \nto adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, the use \nof Xarelto in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at known increased risk for \nbleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. In \naddition these patients are to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications \nand anaemia after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nXarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations Xarelto is to be \nused with caution (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n6 \n \n \n\n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \nPatients on treatment with Xarelto and ASA or with Xarelto and ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine \nshould only receive concomitant treatment with NSAIDs if the benefit outweighs the bleeding risk. \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nIt should be used with caution in ACS and CAD/PAD patients: \n• ≥ 75 years of age if co-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n\nThe benefit-risk of the treatment should be individually assessed on a regular basis. \n• with lower body weight (< 60 kg) if co-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus \n\nclopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n• CAD patients with  severe symptomatic heart failure. Study data indicate that such patients may \n\nbenefit less from treatment with rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nPatients with prior stroke and/or TIA \nPatients with ACS \nXarelto 2.5 mg is contraindicated for the treatment of ACS in patients with a prior stroke or TIA (see \nsection 4.3). Few ACS patients with a prior stroke or TIA have been studied but the limited efficacy \ndata available indicate that these patients do not benefit from treatment. \n \nPatients with CAD/PAD \nCAD/PAD patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke, or an ischaemic, non-lacunar stroke \nwith in the previous month were not studied (see section 4.3).  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \n\n\n\n7 \n \n \n\nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of Xarelto 2.5 mg with ASA alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine \nin these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low (see section 5.2). However, the exact \ntiming to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.  \nPlatelet aggregation inhibitors should be discontinued as suggested by the manufacturer’s prescribing \ninformation.  \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 2.5 mg should be stopped at least \n12 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician. If a \npatient is to undergo elective surgery and anti-platelet effect is not desired, platelet aggregation \ninhibitors should be discontinued as directed by the manufacturer’s prescribing information.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).  \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n \n\nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \n\n\n\n9 \n \n \n\nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \nNo clinically relevant interaction with food was observed (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in \nphase III studies \nIndication Number of \n\npatients* \nTotal daily dose Maximum \n\ntreatment duration \nPrevention of venous \nthromboembolism (VTE) in adult \npatients undergoing elective hip \nor knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically \nill patients \n\n3,997 10 mg 39 days \n\nTreatment of deep vein \nthrombosis (DVT), pulmonary \nembolism (PE) and prevention of \nrecurrence \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: 20 mg \nAfter at least 6 months: \n10 mg or 20 mg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-\nvalvular atrial fibrillation \n\n7,750 20 mg 41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in patients after an ACS \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg respectively, \nco-administered with either \nASA or ASA plus \nclopidogrel or ticlopidine \n\n31 months  \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in patients with CAD/PAD \n\n18,244 5 mg co-administered with \nASA or 10 mg alone \n\n47 months \n\n* Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data \nwere not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 “Management of \nbleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \n\n\n\n14 \n \n \n\nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n \n \n\nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thomboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated, rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor-Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nACS \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Xarelto for the \nprevention of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in subjects with a \nrecent ACS (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non- ST-elevation myocardial infarction \n[NSTEMI] or unstable angina [UA]). In the pivotal double-blind ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 study, \n15,526 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three treatment groups: Xarelto \n2.5 mg orally twice daily, 5 mg orally twice daily or to placebo twice daily co-administered with ASA \nalone or with ASA plus a thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine). Patients with an ACS under the \nage of 55 had to have either diabetes mellitus or a previous MI. The median time on treatment was \n13 months and overall treatment duration was up to almost 3 years. 93.2% of patients received ASA \nconcomitantly plus thienopyridine treatment and 6.8% ASA only. Among patients receiving dual anti-\nplatelets therapy 98.8% received clopidogrel, 0.9% received ticlopidine and 0.3% received prasugrel. \nPatients received the first dose of Xarelto at a minimum of 24 hours and up to 7 days (mean 4.7 days) \nafter admission to the hospital, but as soon as possible after stabilisation of the ACS event, including \nrevascularisation procedures and when parenteral anticoagulation therapy would normally be \ndiscontinued. \nBoth the 2.5 mg twice daily and the 5 mg twice daily regimens of rivaroxaban were effective in \nfurther reducing the incidence of CV events on a background of standard antiplatelet care. The 2.5 mg \ntwice daily regimen reduced mortality, and there is evidence that the lower dose had lower bleeding \nrisks, therefore rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone \nor with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine is recommended for the prevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in adult patients after an ACS with elevated cardiac biomarkers. \nRelative to placebo, Xarelto significantly reduced the primary composite endpoint of CV death, MI or \nstroke. The benefit was driven by a reduction in CV death and MI and appeared early with a constant \ntreatment effect over the entire treatment period (see Table 4 and Figure 1). Also the first secondary \nendpoint (all-cause death, MI or stroke) was reduced significantly. An additional retrospective \nanalysis showed a nominally significant reduction in the incidence rates of stent thrombosis compared \nwith placebo (see Table 4). The incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (non-coronary artery \nbypass graft (CABG) TIMI major bleeding events) were higher in patients treated with Xarelto than in \npatients who received placebo (see Table 6). However the incidence rates were balanced between \nXarelto and placebo for the components of fatal bleeding events, hypotension requiring treatment with \nintravenous inotropic agents and surgical intervention for ongoing bleeding.  \n\n\n\n16 \n \n \n\nIn Table 5 the efficacy results of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are \npresented. The safety results in this subgroup of patients undergoing PCI were comparable to the \noverall safety results.  \nPatients with elevated biomarkers (troponin or CK-MB) and without a prior stroke/TIA constituted \n80% of the study population.

Patients were followed for a median \nof 23 months and maximum of 3.9 years.  \n \nSubjects without a continuous need for treatment with a proton pump inhibitor were randomized to \npantoprazole or placebo. All patients were then randomized 1:1:1 to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice \ndaily/ASA 100 mg once daily, to rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily, or ASA 100 mg once daily alone, and \ntheir matching placebos.  \n \nCAD patients had multivessel CAD and/or prior MI. For patients < 65 years of age atherosclerosis \ninvolving at least two vascular beds or at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors were \nrequired.  \n \nPAD patients had previous interventions such as bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal \nangioplasty or limb or foot amputation for arterial vascular disease or intermittent claudication with \nankle/arm blood pressure ratio < 0.90 and/ or significant peripheral artery stenosis or previous carotid \nrevascularization or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%.  \n \nExclusion criteria included the need for dual antiplatelet or other non-ASA antiplatelet or oral \nanticoagulant therapy and patients with high bleeding risk, or heart failure with ejection fraction \n< 30% or New York Heart Association class III or IV, or any ischaemic, non-lacunar stroke within \n1 month or any history of haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke.  \n \nXarelto 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily was superior to ASA 100 mg, \nin the reduction of the primary composite outcome of CV death, MI, stroke (see Table 7 and Figure 2).  \n \nThere was a significant increase of the primary safety outcome (modified ISTH major bleeding events) \nin patients treated with Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily \ncompared to patients who received ASA 100 mg (see Table 8).  \n\n\n\n19 \n \n \n\nFor the primary efficacy outcome, the observed benefit of Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily plus ASA \n100 mg once daily compared with ASA 100 mg once daily was HR=0.89 (95% CI 0.7-1.1) in patients \n≥75 years (incidence: 6.3% vs 7.0%) and HR=0.70 (95% CI 0.6-0.8) in patients <75 years (3.6% vs \n5.0%).

The overall median study treatment duration was 504 days.  \nPatients must have had symptomatic HF for at least 3 months and left ventricular ejection fraction \n(LVEF) of ≤40% within one year of enrollment. At baseline, the median ejection fraction was 34% \n(IQR: 28%-38%) and 53% of subjects were NYHA Class III or IV.  \nThe primary efficacy analysis (i.e. composite of all-cause mortality, MI, or stroke) showed no \nstatistically significant difference between the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid group and the placebo group \nwith a HR=0.94 (95% CI 0.84 - 1.05), p=0.270. For all-cause mortality, there was no difference \nbetween rivaroxaban and placebo in the number of events (event rate per 100 patient-years; 11.41 vs. \n11.63, HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.10; p=0.743). The event rates for MI per 100 patient-years \n(rivaroxaban vs placebo) were 2.08 vs 2.52 (HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.08; p=0.165) and for stroke \nthe event rates per 100 patient-years were 1.08 vs 1.62 (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95; p=0.023). The \nprincipal safety outcome (i.e. composite of fatal bleeding or bleeding into a critical space with a \npotential for permanent disability), occurred in 18 (0.7%) patients in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice \ndaily treatment group and in 23 (0.9%) patients in the placebo group, respectively (HR=0.80; 95% CI \n0.43 - 1.49; p=0.484). There was a statistically significant increase in ISTH major bleeding in the \nrivaroxaban group compared with placebo (event rate per 100 patient-years: 2.04 vs 1.21, HR 1.68; \n95% CI: 1.18 to 2.39; p=0.003). \nIn patients with mild and moderate heart failure the treatment effects for the COMPASS study \nsubgroup were similar to those of the entire study population (see section CAD/PAD). \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomized open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all \n3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomized to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomized to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of \nthe rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be \ntaken with or without food.  \n\n\n\n22 \n \n \n\nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily. At higher doses \nrivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and decreased \nabsorption rate with increased dose. This is more marked in fasting state than in fed state. Variability \nin rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) ranging from \n30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Xarelto is to be used with \ncaution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with ACS the geometric mean concentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 12 h \nafter dose (roughly representing maximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was \n47 (13 - 123) and 9.2 (4.4 - 18) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor-Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor-Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcgl). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n \n\nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee \nreplacement surgery. \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery \nThe recommended dose is 10 mg rivaroxaban taken orally once daily. The initial dose should be taken \n6 to 10 hours after surgery, provided that haemostasis has been established.  \n \nThe duration of treatment depends on the individual risk of the patient for venous thromboembolism \nwhich is determined by the type of orthopaedic surgery. \n• For patients undergoing major hip surgery, a treatment duration of 5 weeks is recommended. \n• For patients undergoing major knee surgery, a treatment duration of 2 weeks is recommended. \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Xarelto immediately and then continue the following day \nwith once daily intake as before. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n \n\nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE.  \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.   \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Xarelto 10 mg once daily, a \ndose of Xarelto 20 mg once daily should be considered.  \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1-21 15 mg twice daily  30 mg \n\nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily  20 mg \nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE  \n\nFollowing completion \nof at least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE \n\n10 mg once daily or  \n20 mg once daily  \n\n10 mg  \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Xarelto for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nXarelto immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Xarelto per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be \ntaken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily intake as recommended \non the following day.  \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Xarelto immediately, \nand continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be \ndoubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nXarelto therapy should be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2.5.  \n \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, International Normalised Ratio (INR) values will be \nfalsely elevated after the intake of Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity \nof Xarelto, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR. \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is ≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \n\n\n\n28 \n \n \n\nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the parenteral \nmedicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of discontinuation \nof a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto dose would be taken. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n- For the prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement \n\nsurgery, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 50 - 80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30- 49 ml/min) \n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, no dose \n\nadjustment from the recommended dose is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance \n15 - 29 ml/min) renal impairment: patients should be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first \n3 weeks. Thereafter, when the recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose \nfrom 20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk \nfor bleeding outweighs the risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of \n15 mg is based on PK modelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see \nsections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. Therefore, Xarelto is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n \n\nMethod of administration \nXarelto is for oral use.  \nThe tablets can be taken with or without food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally.  \nThe crushed Xarelto tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of the correct \ngastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount of water \nvia a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8). In patients receiving Xarelto for VTE prevention following \nelective hip or knee replacement surgery, this may be done by regular physical examination of the \npatients, close observation of the surgical wound drainage and periodic measurements of haemoglobin. \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n \n \n\nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nXarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations Xarelto is to be \nused with caution (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nHip fracture surgery \nRivaroxaban has not been studied in interventional clinical studies in patients undergoing hip fracture \nsurgery to evaluate efficacy and safety. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n \n\nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low (see section 5.2). \nAt least 18 hours should elapse after the last administration of rivaroxaban before removal of an \nepidural catheter. Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours should elapse before the next \nrivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention other than \nelective hip or knee replacement surgery \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 10 mg should be stopped at least \n24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n33 \n \n \n\n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \nNo clinically relevant interaction with food was observed (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n \n \n\nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in \nphase III studies \nIndication Number of \n\npatients* \nTotal daily dose Maximum \n\ntreatment duration \nPrevention of venous \nthromboembolism (VTE) in adult \npatients undergoing elective hip or \nknee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill \npatients \n\n3,997 10 mg 39 days \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention \nof recurrence \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least 6 \nmonths: 10 mg or 20 \nmg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-\nvalvular atrial fibrillation \n\n7,750 20 mg 41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events \nin patients after an acute coronary \nsyndrome (ACS) \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, co-\nadministered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months  \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events \nin patients with CAD/PAD \n\n18,244 5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone \n\n47 months \n\n* Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data \nwere not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 “Management of \nbleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \n\n\n\n38 \n \n \n\nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n39 \n \n \n\nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant. In patients undergoing major orthopaedic \nsurgery, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of \nmaximum effect) ranged from 13 to 25 s (baseline values before surgery 12 to 15 s). \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thomboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nPrevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery  \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of VTE, i.e. proximal and distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism \n(PE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs. Over 9,500 patients (7,050 \nin total hip replacement surgery and 2,531 in total knee replacement surgery) were studied in \ncontrolled randomised double-blind phase III clinical studies, the RECORD-programme.  \nRivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (od) started no sooner than 6 hours post-operatively was compared \nwith enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours pre-operatively. \nIn all three phase III studies (see table 4), rivaroxaban significantly reduced the rate of total VTE (any \nvenographically detected or symptomatic DVT, non-fatal PE and death) and major VTE (proximal \nDVT, non-fatal PE and VTE-related death), the pre-specified primary and major secondary efficacy \nendpoints. Furthermore, in all three studies the rate of symptomatic VTE (symptomatic DVT, non-\nfatal PE, VTE-related death) was lower in rivaroxaban treated patients compared to patients treated \nwith enoxaparin. \nThe main safety endpoint, major bleeding, showed comparable rates for patients treated with \nrivaroxaban 10 mg compared to enoxaparin 40 mg. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n \n \n\nTable 4: Efficacy and safety results from phase III clinical studies \n RECORD 1 RECORD 2 RECORD 3 \nStudy \npopulation \n\n4,541 patients undergoing total \nhip replacement surgery \n\n2,509 patients undergoing total \nhip replacement surgery \n\n2,531 patients undergoing total \nknee replacement surgery \n\nTreatment \ndose and \nduration \nafter \nsurgery \n\nRivaroxaban \n10 mg od \n\n35 ± 4 days \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg od \n\n35 ± 4 days \n\np Rivaroxaban \n10 mg od \n\n35 ± 4 days \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg od \n\n12 ± 2 days \n\np Rivaroxaban \n10 mg od \n\n12 ± 2 days \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg od \n\n12 ± 2 days \n\np \n\nTotal VTE 18 (1.1%) 58 (3.7%) < 0.001 17 (2.0%)  81 (9.3%) < 0.001 79 (9.6%) 166 (18.9%) < 0.001 \nMajor \nVTE \n\n4 (0.2%) 33 (2.0%) < 0.001 6 (0.6%) 49 (5.1%) < 0.001 9 (1.0%) 24 (2.6%)  0.01 \n\nSymptomatic \nVTE  \n\n6 (0.4%) 11 (0.7%)  3 (0.4%) 15 (1.7%)  8 (1.0%) 24 (2.7%)  \n\nMajor \nbleedings \n\n6 (0.3%) 2 (0.1%)  1 (0.1%) 1 (0.1%)  7 (0.6%) 6 (0.5%)  \n\n \nThe analysis of the pooled results of the phase III studies corroborated the data obtained in the \nindividual studies regarding reduction of total VTE, major VTE and symptomatic VTE with \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily compared to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily. \n  \nIn addition to the phase III RECORD programme, a post-authorization, non-interventional, open-label \ncohort study (XAMOS) has been conducted in 17,413 patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery \nof the hip or knee, to compare rivaroxaban with other pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (standard-\nof-care) under real-life setting. Symptomatic VTE occurred in 57 (0.6%) patients in the rivaroxaban \ngroup (n=8,778) and 88 (1.0%) of patients in the standard-of-care group (n=8,635; HR 0.63; 95% CI \n0.43-0.91); safety population). Major bleeding occurred in 35 (0.4%) and 29 (0.3%) of patients in the \nrivaroxaban and standard-of-care groups (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.67-1.80). Thus, the results were \nconsistent with the results of the pivotal randomised studies. \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe Xarelto clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Xarelto in the initial and \ncontinued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice). and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months.  \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \n\n\n\n41 \n \n \n\nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Xarelto 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  \n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 \nmonths of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Xarelto 20 mg once daily and Xarelto 10 mg \nonce daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE.  \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 5) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); Hazard Ratio \n(HR): 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit \n(primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 \n((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal p value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within \nthe therapeutic range a mean of 60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and \n55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, \nrespectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean \ncentre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 – 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of \nthe recurrent VTE (P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR \nwith rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n \n\nTable 5: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \n\nStudy population 3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nXareltoa) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 36 (2.1%) \n51 \n(3.0%) \n\n Symptomatic recurrent PE 20 (1.2%) \n18 \n(1.0%) \n\n Symptomatic recurrent DVT 14 (0.8%) \n28 \n(1.6%) \n\n Symptomatic PE and DVT 1 (0.1%) 0 \n\n Fatal PE/death where PE cannot \nbe ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2%) \n\n6 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-major \nbleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1%) \n\n138 \n(8.1%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 14 (0.8%) \n20 \n(1.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n\n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 \n(0.749 – 1.684)).

The incidence of the secondary safety outcome \n(major bleeding events) was lower in the rivaroxaban group (1.1% (26/2412)) than in the \nenoxaparin/VKA group (2.2% (52/2405)) with a HR 0.493 (95% CI: 0.308 - 0.789). \n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n \n\nTable 6: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein PE \nStudy population 4,832 patients with an acute symptomatic PE \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nXareltoa) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=2,419 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=2,413 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 50 (2.1%) \n44 \n(1.8%) \n\n Symptomatic recurrent PE 23 (1.0%) \n20 \n(0.8%) \n\n Symptomatic recurrent DVT 18 (0.7%) \n17 \n(0.7%) \n\n Symptomatic PE and DVT 0 2 (<0.1%) \n Fatal PE/death where PE cannot \n\nbe ruled out \n11 \n(0.5%) \n\n7 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-major \nbleeding \n\n249 \n(10.3%) \n\n274 \n(11.4%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 26 (1.1%) \n52 \n(2.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0026 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 1.123 (0.749 –  1.684)  \n\n \nA prespecified pooled analysis of the outcome of the Einstein DVT and PE studies was conducted (see \nTable 7). \n \nTable 7: Efficacy and safety results from pooled analysis of phase III Einstein DVT and Einstein \nPE \nStudy population 8,281 patients with an acute symptomatic DVT or PE \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nXareltoa) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=4,150 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=4,131 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 86 (2.1%) \n95 \n(2.3%) \n\n Symptomatic recurrent PE 43 (1.0%) \n38 \n(0.9%) \n\n Symptomatic recurrent DVT 32 (0.8%) \n45 \n(1.1%) \n\n Symptomatic PE and DVT 1 (<0.1%) \n2 \n(<0.1%) \n\n Fatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n15 \n(0.4%) \n\n13 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding \n\n388 \n(9.4%) \n\n412 \n(10.0%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 40 (1.0%) \n72 \n(1.7%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 1.75); HR: 0.886 (0.661 – 1.186) \n\n \nThe prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) of the \npooled analysis was reported with a HR of 0.771 ((95% CI: 0.614 – 0.967), nominal p value \np = 0.0244). \n \n\n\n\n44 \n \n \n\nIn the Einstein Extension study (see Table 8) rivaroxaban was superior to placebo for the primary and \nsecondary efficacy outcomes.

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and \nrenal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured \nbaseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomized open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomized to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomized to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n \n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake. \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be \ntaken with or without food. Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg \nonce daily. At higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased \nbioavailability and decreased absorption rate with increased dose. This is more marked in fasting state \nthan in fed state. Variability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual \nvariability (CV%) ranging from 30% to 40%, apart from on the day of surgery and the following day \nwhen variability in exposure is high (70%). \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n \n \n\nSpecial populations \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population  \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Xarelto is to be used with \ncaution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for prevention of VTE 10 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 101 (7 - 273) and \n14 (4 ‑ 51) mcg/l, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n \n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects. In patients, baseline factor Xa and PT were \ninfluenced by the surgery resulting in a difference in the concentration-PT slope between the day post-\nsurgery and steady state.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with \none or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes \nmellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack.  \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism  \nThe recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, which is also the recommended maximum dose.  \n \nTherapy with Xarelto should be continued long term provided the benefit of prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism outweighs the risk of bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Xarelto immediately and continue on the following day with \nthe once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make \nup for a missed dose.  \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE.  \n\n\n\n51 \n \n \n\n \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.   \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Xarelto 10 mg once daily, a \ndose of Xarelto 20 mg once daily should be considered.  \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1 - 21 15 mg twice daily  30 mg \n\nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily  20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE  \n\nFollowing completion \nof at least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE  \n\n10 mg once daily or  \n20 mg once daily  \n\n10 mg  \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Xarelto for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nXarelto immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Xarelto per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be \ntaken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily intake as recommended \non the following day.  \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Xarelto immediately, \nand continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be \ndoubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \nFor patients treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, VKA treatment should be \nstopped and Xarelto therapy should be initiated when the International Normalised Ratio (INR) is \n≤ 3.0.  \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nXarelto therapy should be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2.5.  \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, INR values will be falsely elevated after the intake \nof Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of Xarelto, and therefore should \nnot be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR.  \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is ≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n52 \n \n \n\n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the parenteral \nmedicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of discontinuation \nof a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto dose would be taken.  \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 15-\n29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial \n\nfibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n \n\n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: patients \nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the \nrecommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg \nonce daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs the risk for \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and \nhas not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary.  \n\n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 - \n80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population  \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. Therefore, Xarelto is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.  \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nXarelto can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion.  \nFor transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated \nwith anticoagulants, Xarelto treatment should be started at least 4 hours before cardioversion to ensure \n\n\n\n53 \n \n \n\nadequate anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all patients, confirmation should be sought \nprior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Xarelto as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and \nduration of treatment should take established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment \nin patients undergoing cardioversion into account. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) \nwith stent placement \nThere is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg Xarelto once daily (or 10 mg Xarelto once \ndaily for patients with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min]) in addition to \na P2Y12 inhibitor for a maximum of 12 months in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who \nrequire oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nMethod of administration  \nXarelto is for oral use.  \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the administration of \ncrushed Xarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be immediately followed by \nfood. \nThe crushed Xarelto tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of the correct \ngastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount of water \nvia a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water. After the administration of crushed \nXarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should then be immediately followed by enteral \nfeeding (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n \n\nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nXarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nXarelto should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly receiving other \nmedicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \n\n\n\n55 \n \n \n\nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \nClinical data are available from an interventional study with the primary objective to assess safety in \npatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement. Data on efficacy \nin this population are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). No data are available for such patients with a \nhistory of stroke/ transient ischaemic attack (TIA).  \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 15 mg rivaroxaban in these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. \nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-\nlife, i.e. at least 18 hours in young patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the last \nadministration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours \nshould elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 15 mg should be stopped at least \n24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \n\n\n\n56 \n \n \n\nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n \n\nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n \n \n\nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \n\n\n\n59 \n \n \n\nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in \nphase III studies \nIndication Number of \n\npatients* \nTotal daily dose  Maximum \n\ntreatment duration \nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \n(VTE) in adult patients undergoing \nelective hip or knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \nin medically ill patients \n\n3,997 10 mg 39 days \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention \nof recurrence \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least 6 \nmonths: 10 mg or 20 \nmg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation \n\n7,750 20 mg 41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events \nin patients after an ACS \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, co-\nadministered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events \nin patients with CAD/PAD \n\n18,244 5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone \n\n47 months \n\n* Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data \nwere not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 “Management of \nbleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \n\n\n\n63 \n \n \n\nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n64 \n \n \n\nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from \n14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16 - 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged \nfrom 12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 \nto 26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \nThe Xarelto clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Xarelto for the \nprevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  \nIn the pivotal double-blind ROCKET AF study, 14,264 patients were assigned either to Xarelto 20 mg \nonce daily (15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or to warfarin \ntitrated to a target INR of 2.5 (therapeutic range 2.0 to 3.0). The median time on treatment was \n19 months and overall treatment duration was up to 41 months.  \n34.9% of patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and 11.4% were treated with class III \nantiarrhythmic including amiodarone.  \n \nXarelto was non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of stroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism. In the per-protocol population on treatment, stroke or systemic embolism occurred \nin 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.71% per year) and 241 on warfarin (2.16% per year) (HR 0.79; \n95% CI, 0.66 - 0.96; P<0.001 for non-inferiority). Among all randomised patients analysed according \nto ITT, primary events occurred in 269 on rivaroxaban (2.12% per year) and 306 on warfarin (2.42% \nper year) (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 - 1.03; P<0.001 for non-inferiority; P=0.117 for superiority). Results \nfor secondary endpoints as tested in hierarchical order in the ITT analysis are displayed in Table 4. \nAmong patients in the warfarin group, INR values were within the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) a \nmean of 55% of the time (median, 58%; interquartile range, 43 to 71). The effect of rivaroxaban did \nnot differ across the level of centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized \n\n\n\n65 \n \n \n\nquartiles (P=0.74 for interaction). Within the highest quartile according to centre, the Hazrad Ration \n(HR) with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49 - 1.12). \nThe incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding \nevents) were similar for both treatment groups (see Table 5). \n \nTable 4: Efficacy results from phase III ROCKET AF \n\nStudy population ITT analyses of efficacy in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \n\nTreatment dose \n\nXarelto \n20 mg od  \n(15 mg od in patients \nwith moderate renal \nimpairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-\nyr) \n\nWarfarin \ntitrated to a target \nINR of 2.5 \n(therapeutic range \n2.0 to 3.0) \nEvent rate (100 pt-\nyr) \n\nHR (95% CI) \np-value, test for \nsuperiority \n\nStroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism \n\n269 \n(2.12) \n\n306 \n(2.42) \n\n0.88  \n(0.74 - 1.03) \n\n0.117 \nStroke, non-CNS systemic \nembolism and vascular \ndeath \n\n572 \n(4.51) \n\n609 \n(4.81) \n\n0.94  \n(0.84 - 1.05) \n\n0.265 \nStroke, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, vascular death \nand myocardial infarction \n\n659 \n(5.24) \n\n709 \n(5.65) \n\n0.93  \n(0.83 - 1.03) \n\n0.158 \n\n Stroke \n253  \n\n(1.99) \n281 \n\n(2.22) \n0.90  \n\n(0.76 - 1.07) \n0.221 \n\n Non-CNS systemic \nembolism \n\n20  \n(0.16) \n\n27 \n(0.21) \n\n0.74  \n(0.42 - 1.32) \n\n0.308 \n\nMyocardial infarction \n130 \n\n (1.02) \n142 \n\n(1.11) \n0.91  \n\n(0.72 - 1.16)  \n0.464 \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n \n \n\nTable 5: Safety results from phase III ROCKET AF \nStudy population Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillationa) \n\nTreatment dose  \n\nXarelto \n20 mg once a day  \n(15 mg once a day in \npatients with moderate \nrenal impairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin \ntitrated to a target INR \nof 2.5 (therapeutic \nrange 2.0 to 3.0) \n \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nHR (95% CI) \np-value  \n\nMajor and non-major \nclinically relevant bleeding \nevents \n\n1,475 \n(14.91) \n\n1,449 \n(14.52) \n\n1.03 (0.96 - 1.11) \n0.442 \n\nMajor bleeding events 395 (3.60) \n386 \n(3.45) \n\n1.04 (0.90 - 1.20) \n0.576 \n\nDeath due to \nbleeding* \n\n27 \n(0.24) \n\n55 \n(0.48) \n\n0.50 (0.31 - 0.79) \n0.003 \n\nCritical organ \nbleeding* \n\n91 \n(0.82) \n\n133 \n(1.18) \n\n0.69 (0.53 - 0.91) \n0.007 \n\nIntracranial \nhaemorrhage* \n\n55  \n(0.49) \n\n84 \n(0.74) \n\n0.67 (0.47 - 0.93) \n0.019 \n\nHaemoglobin drop* 305 (2.77) \n254 \n(2.26) \n\n1.22 (1.03 - 1.44) \n0.019 \n\nTransfusion of 2 or \nmore units of \npacked red blood \ncells or whole \nblood* \n\n183 \n(1.65) \n\n149 \n(1.32) \n\n1.25 (1.01 - 1.55) \n0.044 \n\nNon-major clinically \nrelevant bleeding events \n\n1,185 \n(11.80) \n\n1,151 \n(11.37) \n\n1.04 (0.96 - 1.13) \n0.345 \n\nAll-cause mortality 208 (1.87) \n250 \n(2.21) \n\n0.85 (0.70 - 1.02) \n0.073 \n\na) Safety population, on treatment \n* Nominally significant \n\n \nIn addition to the phase III ROCKET AF study, a prospective, single-arm, post-authorization, non-\ninterventional, open-label cohort study (XANTUS) with central outcome adjudication including \nthromboembolic events and major bleeding has been conducted. 6,785 patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation were enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) \nsystemic embolism in clinical practice. The mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in \nXANTUS, compared to a mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, \nrespectively. Major bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal haemorrhage was reported in \n0.2 per 100 patient years and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. Stroke or non-CNS \nsystemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 per 100 patient years. \nThese observations in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this \nindication. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nA prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, exploratory study with blinded endpoint \nevaluation (X-VERT) was conducted in 1504 patients (oral anticoagulant naive and pre-treated) with \nnon-valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion to compare rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted \nVKA (randomised 2:1), for the prevention of cardiovascular events. TEE- guided (1 - 5 days of pre-\ntreatment) or conventional cardioversion (at least three weeks of pre-treatment) strategies were \nemployed. The primary efficacy outcome (all stroke, transient ischaemic attack, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death) occurred in 5 (0.5%) patients in the \nrivaroxaban group (n = 978) and 5 (1.0%) patients in the VKA group (n = 492; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.15-\n\n\n\n67 \n \n \n\n1.73; modified ITT population). The principal safety outcome (major bleeding) occurred in 6 (0.6%) \nand 4 (0.8%) patients in the rivaroxaban (n = 988) and VKA (n = 499) groups, respectively (RR 0.76; \n95% CI 0.21-2.67; safety population). This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety \nbetween rivaroxaban and VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n\nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \nA randomised, open-label, multicentre study (PIONEER AF-PCI) was conducted in 2,124 patients \nwith non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PCI with stent placement for primary \natherosclerotic disease to compare safety of two rivaroxaban regimens and one VKA regimen. Patients \nwere randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion for an overall 12-month-therapy. Patients with a history of \nstroke or TIA were excluded.  \nGroup 1 received rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with creatinine \nclearance 30 - 49 ml/min) plus P2Y12 inhibitor. Group 2 received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus \nDAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy i.e. clopidogrel 75 mg [or alternate P2Y12 inhibitor] plus low-dose \nacetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for \nsubjects with creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) once daily plus low-dose ASA. Group 3 received \ndose-adjusted VKA plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by dose-adjusted VKA plus low-dose \nASA.  \nThe primary safety endpoint, clinically significant bleeding events, occurred in 109 (15.7%), 117 \n(16.6%), and 167 (24.0%) subjects in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (HR 0.59; 95% CI \n0.47-0.76; p<0.001, and HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; p<0.001, respectively). The secondary endpoint \n(composite of cardiovascular events CV death, MI, or stroke) occurred in 41 (5.9%), 36 (5.1%), and \n36 (5.2%) subjects in the group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Each of the rivaroxaban \nregimens showed a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding events compared to the \nVKA regimen in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stent \nplacement. \nThe primary objective of PIONEER AF-PCI was to assess safety. Data on efficacy (including \nthromboembolic events) in this population are limited.  \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe Xarelto clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Xarelto in the initial and \ncontinued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \n\n\n\n68 \n \n \n\nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Xarelto 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  \n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  \n \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 \nmonths of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Xarelto 20 mg once daily and Xarelto 10 mg \nonce daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE.  \n \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 \n(0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy \noutcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal \np value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of \n60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the \ntime in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the \nenoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in \nTarget INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE \n(P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban \nversus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \n\n\n\n69 \n \n \n\nTable 6: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \nStudy population 3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nXareltoa) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 36 (2.1%) \n51 \n(3.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE 20 (1.2%) \n18 \n(1.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent \nDVT \n\n14 \n(0.8%) \n\n28 \n(1.6%) \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT 1 (0.1%) 0 \n\nFatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2%) \n\n6 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1%) \n\n138 \n(8.1%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 14 (0.8%) \n20 \n(1.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680  (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n\n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 7) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 \n(0.749 - 1.684)).

The incidence of the secondary safety outcome \n(major bleeding events) was lower in the rivaroxaban group (1.1% (26/2412)) than in the \nenoxaparin/VKA group (2.2% (52/2405)) with a HR 0.493 (95% CI: 0.308 - 0.789). \n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n \n\nTable 7: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein PE \nStudy population 4,832 patients with an acute symptomatic PE \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nXareltoa) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=2,419 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=2,413 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 50 (2.1%) \n44 \n(1.8%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE 23 (1.0%) \n20 \n(0.8%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent \nDVT \n\n18 \n(0.7%) \n\n17 \n(0.7%) \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT 0 2 (<0.1%) \nFatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n11 \n(0.5%) \n\n7 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding \n\n249 \n(10.3%) \n\n274 \n(11.4%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 26 (1.1%) \n52 \n(2.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0026 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 1.123 (0.749 -  1.684)  \n\n \nA prespecified pooled analysis of the outcome of the Einstein DVT and PE studies was conducted (see \nTable 8). \n \nTable 8: Efficacy and safety results from pooled analysis of phase III Einstein DVT and Einstein \nPE \nStudy population 8,281 patients with an acute symptomatic DVT or PE \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nXareltoa) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=4,150 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=4,131 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 86 (2.1%) \n95 \n(2.3%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE 43 (1.0%) \n38 \n(0.9%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent \nDVT \n\n32 \n(0.8%) \n\n45 \n(1.1%) \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT 1 (<0.1%) \n2 \n(<0.1%) \n\nFatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n15 \n(0.4%) \n\n13 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding \n\n388 \n(9.4%) \n\n412 \n(10.0%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 40 (1.0%) \n72 \n(1.7%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 1.75); HR: 0.886 (0.661 -  1.186) \n\n \nThe prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) of the \npooled analysis was reported with a HR of 0.771 ((95% CI: 0.614 - 0.967), nominal p value p= \n0.0244). \n \nIn the Einstein Extension study (see Table 9) rivaroxaban was superior to placebo for the primary and \n\n\n\n71 \n \n \n\nsecondary efficacy outcomes.

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and \nrenal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured \nbaseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomized open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomized to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomized to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When Xarelto 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases in \nmean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, indicating \n\n\n\n73 \n \n \n\nalmost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Xarelto 15 mg and 20 mg are to be taken \nwith food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions Xarelto 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. At \nhigher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose.  \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) \nranging from 30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n \n \n\nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Xarelto is to be used with \ncaution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and 32 (6 -\n 239) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n\n\n\n75 \n \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with \none or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes \nmellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack.  \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism  \nThe recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, which is also the recommended maximum dose.  \n \nTherapy with Xarelto should be continued long term provided the benefit of prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism outweighs the risk of bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Xarelto immediately and continue on the following day with \nthe once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make \nup for a missed dose.  \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE.  \n \n\n\n\n78 \n \n \n\nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.   \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Xarelto 10 mg once daily, a \ndose of Xarelto 20 mg once daily should be considered. \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1 - 21 15 mg twice daily  30 mg \n\nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily  20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE  \n\nFollowing completion \nof at least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE \n\n10 mg once daily or  \n20 mg once daily  \n\n10 mg  \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Xarelto for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nXarelto immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Xarelto per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be \ntaken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily intake as recommended \non the following day.  \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Xarelto immediately, \nand continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be \ndoubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \nFor patients treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, VKA treatment should be \nstopped and Xarelto therapy should be initiated when the International Normalised Ratio (INR) is \n≤ 3.0.  \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nXarelto therapy should be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2.5.  \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, INR values will be falsely elevated after the intake \nof Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of Xarelto, and therefore should \nnot be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR.  \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is ≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n79 \n \n \n\n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the parenteral \nmedicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of discontinuation \nof a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto dose would be taken.  \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 15 -\n 29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial \n\nfibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n \n\n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: patients \nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the \nrecommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg \nonce daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs the risk for \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and \nhas not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary.  \n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 -\n 80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population  \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. Therefore, Xarelto is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.  \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nXarelto can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion.  \nFor transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated \nwith anticoagulants, Xarelto treatment should be started at least 4 hours before cardioversion to ensure \n\n\n\n80 \n \n \n\nadequate anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all patients, confirmation should be sought \nprior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Xarelto as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and \nduration of treatment should take established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment \nin patients undergoing cardioversion into account. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) \nwith stent placement \nThere is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg Xarelto once daily (or 10 mg Xarelto once \ndaily for patients with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min]) in addition to \na P2Y12 inhibitor for a maximum of 12 months in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who \nrequire oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nMethod of administration  \nXarelto is for oral use.  \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the administration of \ncrushed Xarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be immediately followed by \nfood. \nThe crushed Xarelto tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of the correct \ngastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount of water \nvia a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water. After the administration of crushed \nXarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should then be immediately followed by enteral \nfeeding (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \n\n\n\n81 \n \n \n\nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nXarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nXarelto should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly receiving other \nmedicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \n\n\n\n82 \n \n \n\nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \nClinical data are available from an interventional study with the primary objective to assess safety in \npatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement. Data on efficacy \nin this population are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). No data are available for such patients with a \nhistory of stroke/TIA. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 20 mg rivaroxaban in these situations.  \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. \nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-\nlife, i.e. at least 18 hours in young patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the last \nadministration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours \nshould elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 20 mg should be stopped at least \n24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \n\n\n\n83 \n \n \n\nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \n\n\n\n84 \n \n \n\nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \n\n\n\n85 \n \n \n\nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \n\n\n\n86 \n \n \n\nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in \nphase III studies \nIndication Number of \n\npatients* \nTotal daily dose Maximum \n\ntreatment \nduration \n\nPrevention of venous \nthromboembolism (VTE) in adult \npatients undergoing elective hip or \nknee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill \npatients \n\n3,997 10 mg 39 days \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and \nprevention of recurrence \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and \nonwards: 20 mg \nAfter at least 6 \nmonths: 10 mg or 20 \nmg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-\nvalvular atrial fibrillation \n\n7,750 20 mg 41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in patients after an acute \ncoronary syndrome (ACS) \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, co-\nadministered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in patients with CAD/PAD \n\n18,244 5 mg co-\nadministered with \nASA or 10 mg alone \n\n47 months \n\n* Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data \nwere not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 “Management of \nbleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \n\n\n\n90 \n \n \n\nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n91 \n \n \n\nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from \n14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16 - 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged \nfrom 12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 \nto 26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \nThe Xarelto clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Xarelto for the \nprevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  \nIn the pivotal double-blind ROCKET AF study, 14,264 patients were assigned either to Xarelto 20 mg \nonce daily (15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or to warfarin \ntitrated to a target INR of 2.5 (therapeutic range 2.0 to 3.0). The median time on treatment was \n19 months and overall treatment duration was up to 41 months.  \n34.9% of patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and 11.4% were treated with class III \nantiarrhythmic including amiodarone.  \n \nXarelto was non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of stroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism. In the per-protocol population on treatment, stroke or systemic embolism occurred \nin 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.71% per year) and 241 on warfarin (2.16% per year) (HR 0.79; \n95% CI, 0.66 - 0.96; P<0.001 for non-inferiority). Among all randomised patients analysed according \nto ITT, primary events occurred in 269 on rivaroxaban (2.12% per year) and 306 on warfarin (2.42% \nper year) (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 - 1.03; P<0.001 for non-inferiority; P=0.117 for superiority). Results \nfor secondary endpoints as tested in hierarchical order in the ITT analysis are displayed in Table 4. \nAmong patients in the warfarin group, INR values were within the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) a \nmean of 55% of the time (median, 58%; interquartile range, 43 to 71). The effect of rivaroxaban did \nnot differ across the level of centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized \n\n\n\n92 \n \n \n\nquartiles (P=0.74 for interaction). Within the highest quartile according to centre, the Hazard Ratio \n(HR) with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49 - 1.12). \nThe incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding \nevents) were similar for both treatment groups (see Table 5). \n \nTable 4: Efficacy results from phase III ROCKET AF \n\nStudy population ITT analyses of efficacy in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \n\nTreatment dose \n\nXarelto \n20 mg od  \n(15 mg od in patients \nwith moderate renal \nimpairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-\nyr) \n\nWarfarin \ntitrated to a target \nINR of 2.5 \n(therapeutic range \n2.0 to 3.0) \nEvent rate (100 pt-\nyr) \n\nHR (95% CI) \np-value, test for \nsuperiority \n\nStroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism \n\n269 \n(2.12) \n\n306 \n(2.42) \n\n0.88  \n(0.74 - 1.03) \n\n0.117 \nStroke, non-CNS systemic \nembolism and vascular \ndeath \n\n572 \n(4.51) \n\n609 \n(4.81) \n\n0.94  \n(0.84 - 1.05) \n\n0.265 \nStroke, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, vascular death \nand myocardial infarction \n\n659 \n(5.24) \n\n709 \n(5.65) \n\n0.93  \n(0.83 - 1.03) \n\n0.158 \n\nStroke \n253  \n\n(1.99) \n281 \n\n(2.22) \n0.90  \n\n(0.76 - 1.07) \n0.221 \n\nNon-CNS systemic \nembolism \n\n20  \n(0.16) \n\n27 \n(0.21) \n\n0.74  \n(0.42 - 1.32) \n\n0.308 \n\nMyocardial infarction \n130 \n\n (1.02) \n142 \n\n(1.11) \n0.91  \n\n(0.72 - 1.16)  \n0.464 \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n \n \n\nTable 5: Safety results from phase III ROCKET AF \nStudy population Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillationa) \n\nTreatment dose  \n\nXarelto \n20 mg once a day  \n(15 mg once a day in \npatients with moderate \nrenal impairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin \ntitrated to a target INR \nof 2.5 (therapeutic \nrange 2.0 to 3.0) \n \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nHR (95% CI) \np-value  \n\nMajor and non-major \nclinically relevant bleeding \nevents \n\n1,475 \n(14.91) \n\n1,449 \n(14.52) \n\n1.03 (0.96 - 1.11) \n0.442 \n\nMajor bleeding events 395 (3.60) \n386 \n(3.45) \n\n1.04 (0.90 - 1.20) \n0.576 \n\nDeath due to \nbleeding* \n\n27 \n(0.24) \n\n55 \n(0.48) \n\n0.50 (0.31 - 0.79) \n0.003 \n\nCritical organ \nbleeding* \n\n91 \n(0.82) \n\n133 \n(1.18) \n\n0.69 (0.53 - 0.91) \n0.007 \n\nIntracranial \nhaemorrhage* \n\n55  \n(0.49) \n\n84 \n(0.74) \n\n0.67 (0.47 - 0.93) \n0.019 \n\nHaemoglobin drop* 305 (2.77) \n254 \n(2.26) \n\n1.22 (1.03 - 1.44) \n0.019 \n\nTransfusion of 2 or \nmore units of \npacked red blood \ncells or whole \nblood* \n\n183 \n(1.65) \n\n149 \n(1.32) \n\n1.25 (1.01 - 1.55) \n0.044 \n\nNon-major clinically \nrelevant bleeding events \n\n1,185 \n(11.80) \n\n1,151 \n(11.37) \n\n1.04 (0.96 - 1.13) \n0.345 \n\nAll-cause mortality 208 (1.87) \n250 \n(2.21) \n\n0.85 (0.70 - 1.02) \n0.073 \n\na) Safety population, on treatment \n* Nominally significant \n\n \nIn addition to the phase III ROCKET AF study, a prospective, single-arm, post-authorization, non-\ninterventional, open-label cohort study (XANTUS) with central outcome adjudication including \nthromboembolic events and major bleeding has been conducted. 6,785 patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation were enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) \nsystemic embolism in clinical practice. The mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in \nXANTUS, compared to a mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, \nrespectively. Major bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal haemorrhage was reported in \n0.2 per 100 patient years and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. Stroke or non-CNS \nsystemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 per 100 patient years.  \nThese observations in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this \nindication. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nA prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, exploratory study with blinded endpoint \nevaluation (X-VERT) was conducted in 1504 patients (oral anticoagulant naive and pre-treated) with \nnon-valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion to compare rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted \nVKA (randomised 2:1), for the prevention of cardiovascular events. TEE- guided (1 - 5 days of pre-\ntreatment) or conventional cardioversion (at least three weeks of pre-treatment) strategies were \nemployed. The primary efficacy outcome (all stroke, transient ischaemic attack, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death) occurred in 5 (0.5%) patients in the \nrivaroxaban group (n = 978) and 5 (1.0%) patients in the VKA group (n = 492; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.15-\n\n\n\n94 \n \n \n\n1.73; modified ITT population). The principal safety outcome (major bleeding) occurred in 6 (0.6%) \nand 4 (0.8%) patients in the rivaroxaban (n = 988) and VKA (n = 499) groups, respectively (RR 0.76; \n95 % CI 0.21-2.67; safety population). This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety \nbetween rivaroxaban and VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n\nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \nA randomised, open-label, multicentre study (PIONEER AF-PCI) was conducted in 2,124 patients \nwith non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PCI with stent placement for primary \natherosclerotic disease to compare safety of two rivaroxaban regimens and one VKA regimen. Patients \nwere randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion for an overall 12-month-therapy. Patients with a history of \nstroke or TIA were excluded.  \nGroup 1 received rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with creatinine \nclearance 30 - 49 ml/min) plus P2Y12 inhibitor. Group 2 received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus \nDAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy i.e. clopidogrel 75 mg [or alternate P2Y12 inhibitor] plus low-dose \nacetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for \nsubjects with creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) once daily plus low-dose ASA. Group 3 received \ndose-adjusted VKA plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by dose-adjusted VKA plus low-dose \nASA.  \nThe primary safety endpoint, clinically significant bleeding events, occurred in 109 (15.7%), 117 \n(16.6%), and 167 (24.0%) subjects in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (HR 0.59; 95% CI \n0.47-0.76; p<0.001, and HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; p<0.001, respectively). The secondary endpoint \n(composite of cardiovascular events CV death, MI, or stroke) occurred in 41 (5.9%), 36 (5.1%), and \n36 (5.2%) subjects in the group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Each of the rivaroxaban \nregimens showed a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding events compared to the \nVKA regimen in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stent \nplacement. \nThe primary objective of PIONEER AF-PCI was to assess safety. Data on efficacy (including \nthromboembolic events) in this population are limited. \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe Xarelto clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Xarelto in the initial and \ncontinued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \n\n\n\n95 \n \n \n\nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Xarelto 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-\n12 months of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Xarelto 20 mg once daily and Xarelto 10 mg \nonce daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily.  \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE.  \n \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 \n(0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy \noutcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal \np value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of \n60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the \ntime in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the \nenoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in \nTarget INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE \n(P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban \nversus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \nStudy population 3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nXareltoa) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 36 (2.1%) \n51 \n(3.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE 20 (1.2%) \n18 \n(1.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent \nDVT \n\n14 \n(0.8%) \n\n28 \n(1.6%) \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT 1 (0.1%) 0 \n\nFatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2%) \n\n6 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1%) \n\n138 \n(8.1%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 14 (0.8%) \n20 \n(1.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680  (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n\n\n\n96 \n \n \n\n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 7) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 \n(0.749 - 1.684)).

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and \nrenal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured \nbaseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomized open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n\n\n\n99 \n \n \n\n569 days. 59 patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomized to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomized to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When Xarelto 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases in \nmean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, indicating \nalmost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Xarelto 15 mg and 20 mg are to be taken \nwith food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions Xarelto 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. At \nhigher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose.  \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) \nranging from 30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \n\n\n\n100 \n \n \n\nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Xarelto is to be used with \ncaution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n101 \n \n \n\n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and 32 (6 -\n 239) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE.  \n \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.   \n \n\n\n\n104 \n \n \n\nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Xarelto 10 mg once daily, a \ndose of Xarelto 20 mg once daily should be considered. \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1 - 21 15 mg twice daily  30 mg \n\nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily  20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE  \n\nFollowing completion \nof at least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE \n\n10 mg once daily or  \n20 mg once daily  \n\n10 mg  \nor 20 mg \n\n \nThe 4-week treatment initiation pack of Xarelto is dedicated to patients who will transition from \n15 mg twice daily to 20 mg once daily from Day 22 onwards (see section 6.5). \nFor patients with moderate or severe renal impairment where the decision has been taken for 15 mg \nonce daily from Day 22 onwards, other pack sizes only containing 15 mg film-coated tablets are \navailable (see dosing instructions in section “Special populations” below). \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nXarelto immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Xarelto per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be \ntaken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily intake as recommended \non the following day.  \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Xarelto immediately, \nand continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be \ndoubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nXarelto therapy should be initiated once the International Normalised Ratio (INR) is ≤ 2.5.  \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, INR values will be falsely elevated after the intake \nof Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of Xarelto, and therefore should \nnot be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR.  \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is ≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the parenteral \nmedicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of discontinuation \nof a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin). \n\n\n\n105 \n \n \n\n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto dose would be taken.  \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 15 -\n 29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, patients \n\nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks.  \nThereafter, when the recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from \n20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for \nbleeding outweighs the risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of \n15 mg is based on PK modelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see \nsections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary. \n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 -\n 80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population  \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. Therefore, Xarelto is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nXarelto is for oral use.  \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the administration of \ncrushed Xarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be immediately followed by \nfood. \nThe crushed Xarelto tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of the correct \ngastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount of water \nvia a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water. After the administration of crushed \n\n\n\n106 \n \n \n\nXarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should then be immediately followed by enteral \nfeeding (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \n\n\n\n107 \n \n \n\nXarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nXarelto should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly receiving other \nmedicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \n\n\n\n108 \n \n \n\ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban in these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. \nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-\nlife, i.e. at least 18 hours in young patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the last \nadministration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours \nshould elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 15 mg/ Xarelto 20 mg should be \nstopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the \nphysician.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \n\n\n\n109 \n \n \n\nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \n\n\n\n110 \n \n \n\nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n111 \n \n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in \nphase III studies \nIndication Number of \n\npatients* \nTotal daily dose Maximum \n\ntreatment duration \nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \n(VTE) in adult patients undergoing \nelective hip or knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill \npatients \n\n3,997 10 mg 39 days \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention \nof recurrence \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least 6 \nmonths: 10 mg or \n20 mg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation \n\n7,750 20 mg 41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients after an acute coronary \nsyndrome (ACS) \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, co-\nadministered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with CAD/PAD \n\n18,244 5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone \n\n47 months \n\n* Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

pre-specified selective approach to adverse event collection was applied. As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data \nwere not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 “Management of \nbleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \n\n\n\n115 \n \n \n\nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n116 \n \n \n\nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR  is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from \n14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16 - 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged \nfrom 12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 \nto 26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe Xarelto clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Xarelto in the initial and \ncontinued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \n\n\n\n117 \n \n \n\nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Xarelto 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  \n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  \n \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 \nmonths of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Xarelto 20 mg once daily and Xarelto 10 mg \nonce daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE.  \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 4) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); Hazard Ratio \n(HR): 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit \n(primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 \n((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal p value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within \nthe therapeutic range a mean of 60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and \n55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, \nrespectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean \ncentre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of \nthe recurrent VTE (P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR \nwith rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \n\n\n\n118 \n \n \n\nTable 4: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \nStudy population 3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nXareltoa) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 36 (2.1%) \n51 \n(3.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent \nPE \n\n20 \n(1.2%) \n\n18 \n(1.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent \nDVT \n\n14 \n(0.8%) \n\n28 \n(1.6%) \n\nSymptomatic PE and \nDVT \n\n1 \n(0.1%) 0 \n\nFatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2%) \n\n6 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1%) \n\n138 \n(8.1%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 14 (0.8%) \n20 \n(1.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680  (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n\n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 5) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 \n(0.749 - 1.684)).

Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomized open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomized to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomized to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \n\n\n\n122 \n \n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When Xarelto 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases in \nmean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, indicating \nalmost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Xarelto 15 mg and 20 mg are to be taken \nwith food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions Xarelto 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. At \nhigher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose.  \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) \nranging from 30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \n\n\n\n123 \n \n \n\nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Xarelto is to be used with \ncaution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and 32 (6 -\n 239) mcg/l, respectively. \n\n\n\n124 \n \n \n\n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n3. How to take Xarelto \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Xarelto \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nYou have been given Xarelto because  \n\n- you have been diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (a group of conditions that \nincludes heart attack and unstable angina, a severe type of chest pain) and have been \nshown to have had an increase in certain cardiac blood tests. \nXarelto reduces the risk in adults of having another heart attack or reduces the risk of \ndying from a disease related to your heart or your blood vessels. \nXarelto will not be given to you on its own. Your doctor will also tell you to take either: \n• acetylsalicylic acid or \n• acetylsalicylic acid plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n \nor  \n\n \n- you have been diagnosed with a high risk of getting a blood clot due to a coronary artery \n\ndisease or peripheral artery disease which causes symptoms.  \nXarelto reduces the risk in adults of getting blot clots (atherothrombotic events).  \nXarelto will not be given to you on its own. Your doctor will also tell you to take \nacetylsalicylic acid. \n\n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban and belongs to a group of medicines called \nantithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the \ntendency of the blood to form clots.  \n \n \n\n\n\n188 \n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n \nDo not take Xarelto \n- if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are bleeding excessively \n- if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious \n\nbleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes) \n- if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \n\nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open \n\n- if you have an acute coronary syndrome and previously had a bleeding or a blood clot in your \nbrain (stroke)  \n\n- if you have coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease and previously had a bleeding in \nyour brain (stroke) or where there was a blockage of the small arteries providing blood to the \nbrain’s deep tissues (lacunar stroke) or if you had a blood clot in your brain (ischaemic, non-\nlacunar stroke) in the previous month  \n\n- if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \nDo not take Xarelto and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xarelto. \nXarelto should not be used in combination with certain other medicines which reduce blood clotting \nsuch as prasugrel or ticagrelor other than acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel/ticlopidine. \n \nTake special care with Xarelto \n- if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as: \n\n▪ severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that \nworks in your body \n\n▪ if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section “Other medicines and \nXarelto”) \n\n▪ bleeding disorders  \n▪ very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment \n▪ diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy) \n a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n you are older than 75 years  \n you weigh 60 kg or less \n you have a coronary artery disease with severe symptomatic heart failure \n\n- if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n- if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Xarelto. Your doctor will decide, \nif you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n \n\n\n\n189 \n \n \n\nIf you need to have an operation \n- it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times you have \n\nbeen told by your doctor. \n- If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or \n\nspinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): \n it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the injection or removal of the catheter \n\nexactly at the times you have been told by your doctor \n tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems \n\nwith your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nXarelto is not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There is not enough information on \nits use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xarelto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n- If you are taking \n\n some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n\n ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an \nexcess of cortisol) \n\n some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin)  \n some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \n\nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol, prasugrel and ticagrelor (see section \n“Warnings and Precautions”))  \n\n anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)) \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine \nand if you should be kept under closer observation.  \nIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he \nmay also use a preventative ulcer treatment.  \n \n\n- If you are taking \n▪ some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n▪ St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n▪ rifampicin, an antibiotic \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with Xarelto and if \nyou should be kept under closer observation.  \n\n \nPregnancy and breast---feeding \nDo not take Xarelto if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you could become \npregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Xarelto. If you become pregnant while you \nare taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide how you should be treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \nXarelto may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) (see section 4, \n”Possible side effects”). You should not drive or use machines if you are affected by these symptoms.  \n \n\n\n\n190 \n \n \n\nXarelto contains lactose and sodium \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ”sodium-\nfree”. \n \n \n3. How to take Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is one 2.5 mg tablet twice a day. Take Xarelto around the same time every day \n(for example, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening). This medicine can be taken with or \nwithout food.  \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nXarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take \nit.  \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n \nXarelto will not be given to you on its own. \nYour doctor will also tell you to take acetylsalicylic acid. If you get Xarelto after an acute coronary \nsyndrome, your doctor may tell you to also take clopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n \nYour doctor will tell you how much of these to take (usually between 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid \ndaily or a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid plus a daily dose of either 75 mg clopidogrel \nor a standard daily dose of ticlopidine). \n \nWhen to start Xarelto \nTreatment with Xarelto after an acute coronary syndrome should be started as soon as possible after \nstabilisation of the acute coronary syndrome, at the earliest 24 hours after admission to hospital and at \nthe time when parenteral (via injection) anticoagulation therapy would normally be stopped. \nYour doctor will tell you when to start treatment with Xarelto if you have been diagnosed with \ncoronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment. \n \nIf you take more Xarelto than you should \nContact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto \nincreases the risk of bleeding.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xarelto  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n3. How to take Xarelto \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Xarelto \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to  \n-  prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation. Your doctor has \n\nprescribed this medicine for you because after an operation you are at an increased risk of \ngetting blood clots. \n\n-  treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of \nyour lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood \nvessels of your legs and/or lungs. \n\n \nXarelto belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood \nclotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n \nDo not take Xarelto \n- if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are bleeding excessively \n- if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious \n\nbleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes) \n- if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \n\nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open \n\n- if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \nDo not take Xarelto and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n\n\n\n197 \n \n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xarelto. \n \nTake special care with Xarelto \n- if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as: \n\n▪ moderate or severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of \nmedicine that works in your body \n\n▪ if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section “Other medicines and \nXarelto”) \n\n▪ bleeding disorders  \n▪ very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment \n▪ diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n▪ a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy) \n▪ a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n- if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n- if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n- if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical \nprocedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Xarelto. Your doctor will decide, \nif you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n \nIf you need to have an operation \n- it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times you have \n\nbeen told by your doctor.  \n- If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or \n\nspinal anaesthesia or pain reduction):  \n▪ it is very important to take Xarelto exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor  \n▪ tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems \n\nwith your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nXarelto is not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There is not enough information on \nits use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xarelto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \n- If you are taking \n\n▪ some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n\n ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an \nexcess of cortisol) \n\n some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin)  \n▪ some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n\n\n\n198 \n \n \n\n▪ other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol)  \n\n▪ anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n▪ dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n▪ some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)) \n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine \nand if you should be kept under closer observation.  \nIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he \nmay also use a preventative ulcer treatment. \n\n \n- If you are taking \n▪ some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n▪ St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n▪ rifampicin, an antibiotic \n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with Xarelto and if \nyou should be kept under closer observation.  \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Xarelto if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you could become \npregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Xarelto. If you become pregnant while you \nare taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide how you should be treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \nXarelto may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) (see section 4 \n”Possible side effects”). You should not drive or use machines if you are affected by these symptoms.  \n \nXarelto contains lactose and sodium  \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially “sodium-\nfree”. \n \n \n3. How to take Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nHow much to take \n- To prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 10 mg once a day.  \n \n- To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs, \n\nand for preventing blood clots from re-occurring \nAfter at least 6 months blood clot treatment, the recommended dose is either one 10 mg tablet \nonce a day or one 20 mg tablet once a day. Your doctor has prescribed you Xarelto 10 mg once \na day.  \n\n \nSwallow the tablet preferably with water. \nXarelto can be taken with or without food. \n \n\n\n\n199 \n \n \n\nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nXarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take \nit.  \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n \nWhen to take Xarelto \nTake the tablet every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  \nTry to take the tablet at the same time every day to help you to remember it. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  \n \nTo prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation: \nTake the first tablet 6 - 10 hours after your operation.  \nIf you have had a major hip operation you will usually take the tablets for 5 weeks.  \nIf you have had a major knee operation you will usually take the tablets for 2 weeks. \n \nIf you take more Xarelto than you should \nContact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto \nincreases the risk of bleeding.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xarelto  \nIf you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Take the next tablet on the following day \nand then carry on taking a tablet once a day as normal.  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nIf you stop taking Xarelto  \nDo not stop taking Xarelto without talking to your doctor first, because Xarelto prevents the \ndevelopment of a serious condition. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, Xarelto can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLike other similar medicines (antithrombotic agents), Xarelto may cause bleeding which may \npotentially be life threatening.

What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to:  \n- prevent blood clots in brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body if you have a form of \n\nirregular heart rhythm called non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  \n- treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of \n\nyour lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood \nvessels of your legs and/or lungs. \n\n \nXarelto belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood \nclotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n \nDo not take Xarelto \n- if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are bleeding excessively \n- if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious \n\nbleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes) \n- if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \n\nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open. \n\n- if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \nDo not take Xarelto and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n\n\n\n206 \n \n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xarelto. \n \nTake special care with Xarelto \n- if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as: \n\n▪ severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that \nworks in your body \n\n▪ if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section “Other medicines and \nXarelto”) \n\n▪ bleeding disorders  \n▪ very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment \n▪ diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n▪ a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy) \n▪ a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n- if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n- if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n- if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical \nprocedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Xarelto. Your doctor will decide, \nif you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n \nIf you need to have an operation \n- it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times you have \n\nbeen told by your doctor. \n- If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or \n\nspinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): \n it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the injection or removal of the catheter \n\nexactly at the times you have been told by your doctor \n tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems \n\nwith your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nXarelto is not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There is not enough information on \nits use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xarelto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n- If you are taking \n\n▪ some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n\n\n\n207 \n \n \n\n ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an \nexcess of cortisol) \n\n some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin)  \n▪ some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n▪ other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \n\nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol)  \n▪ anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n▪ dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n▪ some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)) \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine \nand if you should be kept under closer observation.  \nIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he \nmay also use a preventative ulcer treatment.  \n \n\n- If you are taking \n▪ some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n▪ St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n▪ rifampicin, an antibiotic \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with Xarelto and if \nyou should be kept under closer observation.  \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Xarelto if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you could become \npregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Xarelto. If you become pregnant while you \nare taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide how you should be treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \nXarelto may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) (see section 4, \n”Possible side effects”). You should not drive or use machines if you are affected by these symptoms.  \n \nXarelto contains lactose and sodium \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially “sodium-\nfree”. \n \n \n3. How to take Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nYou must take Xarelto together with a meal.  \nSwallow the tablet(s) preferably with water. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nXarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take \nit. This mixture should be immediately followed by food. \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n \n\n\n\n208 \n \n \n\nHow much to take \n- To prevent blood clots in brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 20 mg once a day.  \nIf you have kidney problems, the dose may be reduced to one tablet Xarelto 15 mg once a day.  \n \nIf you need a procedure to treat blocked blood vessels in your heart (called a percutaneous \ncoronary intervention - PCI with an insertion of a stent), there is limited evidence to reduce the \ndose to one tablet Xarelto 15 mg once a day (or to one tablet Xarelto 10 mg once a day in case \nyour kidneys are not working properly) in addition to an antiplatelet medicinal product such as \nclopidogrel. \n\n \n- To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs, \n\nand for preventing blood clots from re-occurring \nThe recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 15 mg twice a day for the first 3 weeks. For \ntreatment after 3 weeks, the recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 20 mg once a day.  \nAfter at least 6 months blood clot treatment your doctor may decide to continue treatment with \neither one 10 mg tablet once a day or one 20 mg tablet once a day. \nIf you have kidney problems and take one tablet Xarelto 20 mg once a day, your doctor may \ndecide to reduce the dose for the treatment after 3 weeks to one tablet Xarelto 15 mg once a day \nif the risk for bleeding is greater than the risk for having another blood clot.  \n\n \nWhen to take Xarelto \nTake the tablet(s) every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  \nTry to take the tablet(s) at the same time every day to help you to remember it. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  \n \nTo prevent blood clots in the brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body: \nIf your heart beat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take Xarelto at \nthe times your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you take more Xarelto than you should \nContact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto \nincreases the risk of bleeding.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xarelto \n- If you are taking one 20 mg tablet or one 15 mg tablet once a day and have missed a dose, take \n\nit as soon as you remember. Do not take more than one tablet in a single day to make up for a \nforgotten dose. Take the next tablet on the following day and then carry on taking one tablet \nonce a day. \n\n \n- If you are taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you \n\nremember. Do not take more than two 15 mg tablets in a single day. If you forget to take a dose \nyou can take two 15 mg tablets at the same time to get a total of two tablets (30 mg) on one day. \nOn the following day you should carry on taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day. \n\n \nIf you stop taking Xarelto \nDo not stop taking Xarelto without talking to your doctor first, because Xarelto treats and prevents \nserious conditions.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Xarelto can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n209 \n \n \n\nLike other similar medicines (antithrombotic agents), Xarelto may cause bleeding which may \npotentially be life threatening. Excessive bleeding may lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure \n(shock). In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. \n \nPossible side effects which may be a sign of bleeding \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects: \n- long or excessive bleeding \n- exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache, unexplained swelling, \n\nbreathlessness, chest pain or angina pectoris, which may be signs of bleeding. \nYour doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change how you should be treated.  \n \nPossible side effects which may be a sign of severe skin reaction \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience skin reactions such as:  \n- spreading intense skin rash, blisters or mucosal lesions, e.g. in the mouth or eyes (Stevens-\n\nJohnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis).

What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n3. How to take Xarelto \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Xarelto \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to:  \n- treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of \n\nyour lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood \nvessels of your legs and/or lungs. \n\n \nXarelto belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood \nclotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n \nDo not take Xarelto \n- if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are bleeding excessively \n- if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious \n\nbleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes) \n- if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \n\nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open. \n\n- if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \nDo not take Xarelto and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n\n\n\n215 \n \n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xarelto. \n \nTake special care with Xarelto \n- if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as: \n\n▪ severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that \nworks in your body \n\n▪ if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section “Other medicines and \nXarelto”) \n\n▪ bleeding disorders  \n▪ very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment \n▪ diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n▪ a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy) \n▪ a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n- if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n- if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n- if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical \nprocedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Xarelto. Your doctor will decide, \nif you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n \nIf you need to have an operation \n- it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times you have \n\nbeen told by your doctor. \n- If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or \n\nspinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): \n it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the injection or removal of the catheter \n\nexactly at the times you have been told by your doctor \n tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems \n\nwith your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nXarelto is not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There is not enough information on \nits use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xarelto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n- If you are taking \n\n▪ some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n\n\n\n216 \n \n \n\n ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an \nexcess of cortisol) \n\n some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin)  \n▪ some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n▪ other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \n\nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol)  \n▪ anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n▪ dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n▪ some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)) \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine \nand if you should be kept under closer observation.  \nIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he \nmay also use a preventative ulcer treatment.  \n \n\n- If you are taking \n▪ some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n▪ St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n▪ rifampicin, an antibiotic \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with Xarelto and if \nyou should be kept under closer observation.  \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Xarelto if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you could become \npregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Xarelto. If you become pregnant while you \nare taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide how you should be treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \nXarelto may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) (see section 4, \n”Possible side effects”). You should not drive or use machines if you are affected by these symptoms.  \n \nXarelto contains lactose and sodium \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially “sodium-\nfree”. \n \n \n3. How to take Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nYou must take Xarelto together with a meal.  \nSwallow the tablet(s) preferably with water. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nXarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take \nit. This mixture should be immediately followed by food. \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n \n\n\n\n217 \n \n \n\nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 15 mg twice a day for the first 3 weeks. For treatment \nafter 3 weeks, the recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 20 mg once a day.  \nThis Xarelto 15 mg and 20 mg treatment initiation pack is only for the first 4 weeks of treatment.  \nUpon completion of this pack, treatment will continue on Xarelto 20 mg once daily as your doctor has \ntold you.  \nIf you have kidney problems, your doctor may decide to reduce the dose for the treatment after 3 \nweeks to one tablet Xarelto 15 mg once a day if the risk for bleeding is greater than the risk for having \nanother blood clot.  \n \nWhen to take Xarelto \nTake the tablet(s) every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  \nTry to take the tablet(s) at the same time every day to help you to remember it. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  \n \nIf you take more Xarelto than you should \nContact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto \nincreases the risk of bleeding.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xarelto \n- If you are taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you \n\nremember. Do not take more than two 15 mg tablets in a single day. If you forget to take a dose \nyou can take two 15 mg tablets at the same time to get a total of two tablets (30 mg) on one day. \nOn the following day you should carry on taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day. \n \n\n- If you are taking one 20 mg tablet once a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you \nremember. Do not take more than one tablet in a single day to make up for a forgotten dose. \nTake the next tablet on the following day and then carry on taking one tablet once a day. \n\n \nIf you stop taking Xarelto \nDo not stop taking Xarelto without talking to your doctor first, because Xarelto treats and prevents \nserious conditions.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Xarelto can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLike other similar medicines (antithrombotic agents), Xarelto may cause bleeding which may \npotentially be life threatening. Excessive bleeding may lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure \n(shock). In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. \n \nPossible side effects which may be a sign of bleeding \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects: \n- long or excessive bleeding \n- exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache, unexplained swelling, \n\nbreathlessness, chest pain or angina pectoris, which may be signs of bleeding. \nYour doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change how you should be treated.  \n \nPossible side effects which may be a sign of severe skin reaction \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience skin reactions such as:  \n- spreading intense skin rash, blisters or mucosal lesions, e.g. in the mouth or eyes (Stevens-\n\nJohnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis).
