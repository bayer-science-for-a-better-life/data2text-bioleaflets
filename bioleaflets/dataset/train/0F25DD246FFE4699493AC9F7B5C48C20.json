QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInfluenza virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase), inactivated, of the following \nstrains*: \n \n\n Per 0.5 ml dose \n \n\nA/xxxxx (H1N1) - like strain  \n(reassortant used) \n \n\n15 micrograms HA** \n\nA/xxxxx (H3N2) - like strain  \n(reassortant used) \n \n\n15 micrograms HA** \n\nB/xxxxx \u2013 like strain \n(reassortant used) \n \n\n15 micrograms HA** \n\nB/xxxxx \u2013 like strain \n(reassortant used) \n \n\n15 micrograms HA** \n\n*propagated in fertilised hens\u2019 eggs from healthy chicken flocks and adjuvanted with MF59C.1 \n**haemagglutinin \n \nAdjuvant MF59C.1 containing per 0.5 ml dose: squalene (9.75 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.175 mg), \nsorbitan trioleate (1.175 mg), sodium citrate (0.66 mg) and citric acid (0.04 mg).  \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendations (Northern Hemisphere) and EU \nrecommendation for the xxxx/xxxx season. \n \nFluad Tetra may contain traces of eggs such as ovalbumin or chicken proteins, kanamycin and \nneomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, hydrocortisone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) which \nare used during the manufacturing process (see section 4.3). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection). \nMilky-white suspension. \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in the elderly (65 years of age and older). \n \nFluad Tetra should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nOne 0.5 ml dose. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Fluad Tetra in children from birth to less than 18 years has not been \nestablished. Currently available safety and immunogenicity data in children from 6 months to less than \n6 years of age are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on posology can be made.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor intramuscular injection only. \n \nThe preferred injection site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. \n \nThe vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be \nmixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. \n \nFor instructions for preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the components of the adjuvant, to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible trace residues such as ovalbumin, kanamycin and \nneomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and hydrocortisone. \n \nA severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to previous influenza vaccination. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nVaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, Fluad Tetra must be administered with caution to individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular \nadministration. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \n\n\n\n4 \n\ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient \nto prevent influenza. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo clinical data on concomitant administration of Fluad Tetra with other vaccines are available. If \nFluad Tetra is to be used at the same time as another vaccine, it should be administered at separate \ninjection sites and preferably on different limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be \nintensified by any co-administration. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nThis medicine is not indicated in women of childbearing potential (see section 4.1). It is not to be used \nin women who are, or may be, pregnant or breast-feeding.  \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of Fluad Tetra in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFluad Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nElderly population \nThe safety of Fluad Tetra in elderly subjects 65 years of age and older was evaluated in two clinical \nstudies (V118_20 and V118_18), in which 4269 received Fluad Tetra.  \n \nSolicited local and systemic adverse reactions were collected for 7 days after vaccination. Unsolicited \nadverse reactions were collected for 21 days after vaccination.  \n \nThe most commonly reported (\u226510%) adverse reactions across both studies were injection site pain \n(16.3% and 31.9%), fatigue (10.5% and 16.0%) and headache (10.8% and 12.0%) (for V118_18 and \nV118_20, respectively). Most solicited reactions were reported as mild or moderate in intensity and \nresolved within the first 3 days after vaccination.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nFluad Tetra is not indicated for use in children, see section 4.2. Safety information in the paediatric \npopulation is presented in section 5.1. \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common \n(\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 - <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 - <1/100). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported following vaccination in elderly subjects 65 years and older \nin clinical trials \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan class \n\nVery common \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to \n\n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n\n<1/100) \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Loss of appetite  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea,  \nDiarrhoea  \n\nVomiting \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Myalgia, \nArthralgia \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site \npain,  \nFatigue  \n\nEcchymosis*,  \nChills,  \nErythema, \nInduration, \nInfluenza-like \nillness \n\nFever (\u2265 38oC) \n\n*Or Injection site bruising \n \nAdverse reactions reported from post-marketing surveillance \n \nThere are currently no post-marketing data available for Fluad Tetra. However, the post-marketing \nexperience with Fluad (trivalent formulation) is relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines are \nmanufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. The following adverse \nreactions were reported from post marketing surveillance with Fluad (trivalent formulation):  \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nThrombocytopenia (some very rare cases were severe with platelet counts less than 5,000 per mm3), \nlymphadenopathy \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nExtensive swelling of injected limb lasting more than one week, injection-site cellulitis-like reaction \n(some cases of swelling, pain, and redness extending more than 10 cm and lasting more than 1 week)  \n \nImmune system disorders \nAllergic reactions including anaphylactic shock (in rare cases), anaphylaxis, and angioedema  \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMuscular weakness  \n \nNervous system disorders \nEncephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, convulsions, neuritis, neuralgia, paraesthesia \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nGeneralised skin reactions including erythema multiforme, urticaria, pruritus or non-specific rash \n \nVascular disorders \nVasculitis that may be associated with transient renal involvement \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThere are no post-marketing data available for Fluad Tetra and limited data for Fluad (trivalent \nformulation) in the paediatric population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdosage is unlikely to have any untoward effect. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFluad Tetra provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and two \nB types) contained in the vaccine. Fluad Tetra induces humoral antibodies against the \nhaemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. \n \nSpecific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated \ninfluenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus, but the HI antibody \ntitres have been used as a measure of vaccine efficacy. \n \nAntibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. \nFurthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new \nantigenic variant of the same type or subtype. \n \nFluad Tetra contains the adjuvant MF59C.1 (MF59), which is designed to increase and broaden the \nantigen-specific immune response and to extend the duration of the immune response. \n \nAnnual revaccination is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination \nand circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nElderly population (65 years and older) \n \nImmunogenicity  \nThe immunogenicity of Fluad Tetra was evaluated in clinical study V118_20, a multicentre, \nrandomised, double-blind, comparator controlled study conducted during the 2017-2018 Northern \nHemisphere influenza season. Elderly subjects 65 years of age and older were randomised (2:1:1) to \nreceive Fluad Tetra, the licensed adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluad, aTIV-1) or an \nadjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine containing the alternate B strain (aTIV-2). \nEligible subjects were men or women \u226565 years of age who were healthy or had comorbidities that \nincreased their risk of influenza complications. The mean age of subjects at enrolment who received \nFluad Tetra was 72.4 years. Female subjects represented 58.2% of the study population. \nThe immunogenicity endpoints assessed 3 weeks after vaccination were haemagglutination inhibition \n(HI) geometric mean antibody titre (GMT) and HI seroconversion rate (pre-vaccination HI titre <1:10 \nand post-vaccination HI titre \u2265 1:40 or at least a 4-fold increase in HI from pre-vaccination HI titre \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n\u2265 1:10). Fluad Tetra met non-inferiority for all 4 influenza strains and superiority to the alternate B \nstrain not included in the Fluad aTIV comparators. The non-inferiority data are summarised in \nTable 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Post-vaccination GMT and seroconversion rates in elderly subjects 65 years of age and \nolder \n\n GMT \n(95% CI) \n\nGMT Ratioa \n\nStrain \nFluad Tetra \n\nN=872 \n\naTIV-1 \n(B-Victoria) \n\nN=436 \n\naTIV-2 \n(B-Yamagata) \n\nN=433 \n\naTIVd/Fluad Tetra \n(95% CI) \n\nA/H1N1 \n65.0 \n\n(57.8; 73.1)  \n75.2 \n\n(66.7; 84.7) \n1.2  \n\n(1.1; 1.3) \n\nA/H3N2 \n294.9 \n\n(261.9; 332.1) \n293.3 \n\n(259.9; 331.0) \n1.0 \n\n(0.9; 1.1) \n\nB/Yamagata \n24.7  \n\n(22.7; 26.8) \nNA \n\n24.3  \n(22.0; 26.8) \n\n1.0 \n(0.9; 1.1) \n\nB/Victoria \n30.8 \n\n(28.3; 33.5) \n30.1  \n\n(27.3; 33.2) \nNA \n\n1.0 \n(0.9; 1.1) \n\n \n\n \nSeroconversion %c \n\n(95% CI) \nSeroconversion \n\nDifferenceb \n\nStrain \nFluad Tetra \n\nN=872 \n\naTIV-1 \n(B-Victoria) \n\nN=436 \n\naTIV-2 \n(B-Yamagata) \n\nN=433 \n\naTIVd \u2013 Fluad Tetra \n(95% CI) \n\n   \n\nA/H1N1 \n35.2 \n\n(32.0; 38.5) \n38.4 \n\n(35.2; 41.8) \n3.2 \n\n(-1.3; 7.8) \n\nA/H3N2 \n39.3 \n\n(36.1; 42.7) \n39.7 \n\n(36.4; 43.0) \n0.4 \n\n(-4.2; 5.0) \n\nB/Yamagata \n16.4 \n\n(14.0; 19.0) \nNA \n\n15.5 \n(12.2; 19.2) \n\n-0.9 \n(-5.1; 3.3) \n\nB/Victoria \n13.4 \n\n(11.2; 15.9) \n12.2 \n\n(9.2; 15.6) \nNA \n\n-1.3 \n(-5.1; 2.6) \n\nAbbreviations: GMT= Geometric Mean antibody titre; CI= Confidence Interval; NA= Not Applicable. \naTIV-1: licensed MF59-adjuvanted trivalent subunit inactivated egg-derived influenza vaccine, FLUAD TIV containing B-\nVictoria; aTIV-2: MF59-adjuvanted trivalent subunit inactivated egg-derived influenza vaccine containing B-Yamagata \nN= the number of vaccinated subjects with available data from the immunogenicity endpoint listed (Per Protocol Set). \na Non-inferiority for the GMT ratio was defined as: the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the GMTs did \nnot exceed 1.5. \nb Non-inferiority for the seroconversion difference was defined as: the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the \ndifference between the seroconversions did not exceed 10%. \nc Seroconversion was defined as pre-vaccination HI titre <1:10 and post-vaccination HI titre \u2265 1:40 or at least a 4-fold \nincrease in HI from pre-vaccination HI titre \u2265 1:10. \nd aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 vaccine groups are pooled for the analysis of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains. For B/Victoria \naTIV=aTIV-1, for B/Yamagata aTIV=aTIV-2. \n\n \nImmunogenicity of aTIV \n \nThe immunogenicity of Fluad (trivalent formulation) is relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines \nare manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. \nStudy V70_27 was a large Phase 3, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, multicentre study to \nevaluate the immunogenicity and the safety of Fluad in comparison to non-adjuvanted vaccine and it \nwas conducted in 2010-2011. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 0.5 ml dose \nof Fluad or a single dose of a non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. All subjects were followed for \napproximately one year post-vaccination. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nA total of 7082 subjects were randomised and vaccinated, including 3541 subjects in each of the \npooled Fluad and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. A total of 2573 subjects (1300 in Fluad and 1273 in \nnon-adjuvanted vaccine group) were regarded as \u201chigh risk\u201d subjects (underlying chronic diseases \nincluding congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, hepatic disease, \nrenal insufficiency and/or neurological/neuromuscular or metabolic disorders including diabetes \nmellitus). \nThe primary objective of a superiority of Fluad versus non-adjuvanted vaccine was not achieved for \nall homologous strains. GMT ratios ranged from 1.15 to 1.61 with the lowest limit of the 95% CI of \n1.08 and differences in seroconversion rates ranged from 3.2% \u2013 13.9% with the lowest limit of the \n95% CI of 1.1%.  \nFluad elicited higher antibody titres for A/H3N2 that persisted up to 12 months post-vaccination. The \nresults were similar for high-risk subjects with predefined comorbidities.  \n \nEffectiveness \nNo effectiveness studies have been performed with Fluad Tetra. The observational effectiveness \nstudies performed with Fluad (trivalent formulation) are relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines \nare manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.  \n \nPaediatric Population (6 months to less than 6 years) \n \nFluad Tetra is not indicated for use in children, see section 4.2.  \nEfficacy, immunogenicity and safety of Fluad Tetra was evaluated in clinical study V118_05, a \nmulticentre, randomised, observer-blinded, controlled study conducted in the 2013-14 (season 1) and \n2014-15 (season 2) Northern Hemisphere seasons in children of 6 months to less than 6 years. \nChildren less than 3 years of age received 0.25 ml vaccine, older children received 0.5 ml vaccine. \nChildren na\u00efve to prior influenza vaccination received two doses of vaccine, at least 4 weeks apart. \n10,644 children were enrolled and randomised to receive Fluad Tetra or the non-adjuvanted \ncomparator vaccine in a 1:1 ratio: 5,352 children were enrolled in the Fluad Tetra group and 5,292 \nchildren in the non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine group. \n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nA subset of children enrolled in this study was evaluated for their immunological response to Fluad \nTetra and the non-adjuvanted comparator. Immunogenicity assessments were performed prior to \n(each) vaccination and 3 weeks after the last vaccination. A total of 2886 children were included in the \nsubset for immunogenicity evaluation (Fluad Tetra: N=1481; non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine: \nN=1405).  \n \nFluad Tetra demonstrated a higher immune response compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator \nvaccine. In addition, in children na\u00efve to influenza vaccination antibody titres 4 weeks after the first \nvaccination as well as 3 weeks after the second vaccination were greater in subjects who received \nFluad Tetra.  \nAt 12 months post-vaccination, persistence of the immune response was higher in the Fluad Tetra \ngroup compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator group.  \n \nEfficacy  \n \nVaccine efficacy was assessed for the prevention of first-occurrence laboratory confirmed influenza \nassociated with symptomatic influenza-like illness (ILI). Influenza-like illness was defined as fever of \n37.8\u00b0C or above along with any of the following: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or runny nose \noccurring at \u2265 21 days and \u2264 180 days after the last vaccination or until the end of the influenza \nseason, whichever was longer. Subjects with ILI had nasopharyngeal swabs collected and tested for \ninfluenza A (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and B (both lineages) by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase \nChain Reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 508 cases of first-occurrence RT-PCR confirmed influenza \noccurred during the study; 10 during season one and 498 during season two. The majority of influenza \ncases were A/H3N2. Based on antigenic typing, more than ninety percent of A/H3N2 strains from \n\n\n\n9 \n\nseason two were determined to be antigenically distinct from egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012, the \nH3N2 vaccine strain. \n \nVaccine efficacy compared to the non-adjuvanted influenza comparator vaccine was assessed. The \nrelative vaccine (rVE) efficacy between Fluad Tetra and the comparator vaccine group in subjects \u22656 \nto <72 months of age was -0.67 [95% CI: -19.81; 15.41]), which did not meet the primary objective of \nthe study. \n \nSafety \n \nSafety data were collected up to 12 months after receipt of the last vaccination. \nA higher incidence of local and systemic reactions was reported in subjects who received Fluad Tetra \ncompared to the non-adjuvanted comparator influenza vaccine.  \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (>10%) were tenderness (43.2%), irritability (27.1%), \nsleepiness (26.3%), change in eating habits (22.5%), fever (19.1%), diarrhoea (12.3%) and vomiting \n(10.3%).  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFluad Tetra in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of influenza infection. \nSee section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated-dose \ntoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, local tolerance and sensitisation. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fluad Tetra is and what it is used for \n \nFluad Tetra is a vaccine against flu (influenza).  \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu.  \n \nFluad Tetra is used to prevent flu in elderly adults of 65 years of age and older. \n \nThe vaccine targets four strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World \nHealth Organisation for the xxxx/xxxx season. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Fluad Tetra \n \nYou should not receive Fluad Tetra \n- if you are allergic to  \n\n\u2022 the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)  \n\u2022 egg or chicken proteins (such as ovalbumin), kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, \n\ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and hydrocortisone, which are trace residues from \nthe manufacturing process. \n\n- If you have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to previous influenza vaccination. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Fluad Tetra \n \nBEFORE receiving the vaccine \n\u2022 Your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily \n\navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms \n\n\n\n23 \n\nsuch as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the \nadministration. This reaction may occur with Fluad Tetra as with all vaccines that are injected. \n\n\u2022 You should tell your doctor if you have an acute illness associated with fever. Your doctor may \ndecide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone. \n\n\u2022 You should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment \nwhich affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or \ncorticosteroid medicines (see Section \u201cOther medicines and Fluad Tetra\u201d). \n\n\u2022 You should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n\u2022 Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or \n\nnurse if you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Fluad Tetra may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \nChildren \nFluad Tetra is not recommended for use in children.  \n \nOther medicines and Fluad Tetra \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other \nvaccine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nThis vaccine is for use in elderly adults 65 years and older. It is not to be used in women who are, or \nmay be, pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nFluad Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nFluad Tetra contains potassium and sodium  \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium free\u2019. \nThis vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018potassium free\u2019. \n \n \n3.

occurred occasionally during general use of another vaccine similar to fluad tetra. reduction in the number of certain types of particles in the blood called platelets; a low number of these can result in excessive bruising or bleeding (thrombocytopenia); swelling of the glands in the neck, armpit or groin (lymphadenopathy) swelling, pain and redness at the injection site extending to more than 10 cm and lasting more than one week (injection site cellulitis-like reaction) extensive swelling of injected limb lasting more than one week. allergic reactions: - sudden fall in blood pressure due to severe allergic reactions that in rare cases can lead to failure of the circulatory system to maintain adequate blood flow to the different organs (shock), - swelling most apparent in the head and neck, including the face, lips, tongue, throat or any other part of the body (angioedema). muscular weakness pain on the nerve path (neuralgia), unusual feeling of touch, pain, heat and cold
