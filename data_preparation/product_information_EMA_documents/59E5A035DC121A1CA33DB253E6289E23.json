NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDepoCyte 50 mg suspension for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of suspension contains 10 mg cytarabine.  \nEach 5 ml vial contains 50 mg cytarabine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nWhite to off-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIntrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis. In the majority of patients such treatment will be \npart of symptomatic palliation of the disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDepoCyte should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \ncancer chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nPosology \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and efficacy in children aged under 18 years have not been established. Currently available data \nare described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. DepoCyte is not \nrecommended for use in children and adolescents until further data become available. \n \nAdults and the elderly \n \nFor the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis, the dose for adults is 50 mg (one vial) administered \nintrathecally (lumbar puncture or intraventricularly via an Ommaya reservoir). The following regimen \nof induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy is recommended: \n \nInduction therapy: 50 mg administered every 14 days for 2 doses (weeks 1 and 3). \n \nConsolidation therapy: 50 mg administered every 14 days for 3 doses (weeks 5, 7 and 9) followed by \nan additional dose of 50 mg at week 13. \n \nMaintenance therapy:  50 mg administered every 28 days for 4 doses (weeks 17, 21, 25 and 29). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nDepoCyte is to be administered by slow injection over a period of 1-5 minutes directly into the \ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via either an intraventricular reservoir or by direct injection into the lumbar \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3  \n\nsac.  Following administration by lumbar puncture, it is recommended that the patient should be \ninstructed to lie flat for one hour.  All patients should be started on dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily \neither orally or intravenously for 5 days beginning on the day of injection of DepoCyte. \n \nDepoCyte must not be administered by any other route of administration. DepoCyte must be used as \nsupplied; it must not be diluted (see section 6.2). Patients should be observed by the physician for \nimmediate toxic reactions. \n \nIf neurotoxicity develops, the dose should be reduced to 25 mg.  If it persists, treatment with \nDepoCyte should be discontinued. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Patients with \nactive meningeal infection. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients receiving DepoCyte should be concurrently treated with corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) \nto mitigate the symptoms of arachnoiditis (see section 4.8), which is a very common adverse reaction. \n \nArachnoiditis is a syndrome manifested primarily by nausea, vomiting, headache and fever. If left \nuntreated, chemical arachnoiditis may be fatal. \n \nPatients should be informed about the expected adverse reactions of headache, nausea, vomiting and \nfever, and about the early signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity.  The importance of concurrent \ndexamethasone administration should be emphasised at the initiation of each cycle of DepoCyte \ntreatment.  Patients should be instructed to seek medical attention if signs or symptoms of \nneurotoxicity develop, or if oral dexamethasone is not well tolerated. \n \nCytarabine, when administered intrathecally, has been associated with nausea, vomiting and serious \ncentral nervous system toxicity which can lead to a permanent deficit, this includes blindness, \nmyelopathy and other neurological toxicity. \n \nAdministration of DepoCyte in combination with other neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents or with \ncranial/spinal irradiation may increase the risk of neurotoxicity. \n \nInfectious meningitis may be associated with intrathecal administration. Hydrocephalus has also been \nreported, possibly precipitated by arachnoiditis. \n \nBlockage or reduction of CSF flow may result in increased free cytarabine concentrations in the CSF \nwith increased risk of neurotoxicity. Therefore, as with any intrathecal cytotoxic therapy, consideration \nshould be given to the need for assessment of CSF flow before treatment is started. \n \nAlthough significant systemic exposure to free cytarabine is not expected following intrathecal \ntreatment, some effects on bone marrow function cannot be excluded.  Systemic toxicity due to \nintravenous administration of cytarabine consists primarily of bone marrow suppression with \nleucopenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Therefore monitoring of the haemopoietic system is \nadvised. \n \nAnaphylactic reactions following intravenous administration of free cytarabine have been rarely \nreported. \n \nSince DepoCyte’s particles are similar in size and appearance to white blood cells, care must be taken \nin interpreting CSF examination following administration. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4  \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo definite interactions between DepoCyte delivered intrathecally and other medicinal products have \nbeen established. \n \nConcomitant administration of DepoCyte with other antineoplastic agents administered by the \nintrathecal route has not been studied. \n \nIntrathecal co-administration of cytarabine with other cytotoxic agents may increase the risk of \nneurotoxicity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nDespite the low apparent risk women of childbearing potential should not receive treatment until \npregnancy is excluded and should be advised to use a reliable contraceptive method. \n \nGiven that cytarabine has a mutagenic potential which could induce chromosomal damage in the \nhuman spermatozoa, males undergoing DepoCyte treatment and their partner should be advised to use \na reliable contraceptive method. \n \nPregnancy \n \nTeratology studies in animals have not been conducted with DepoCyte and there are no adequate and \nwell controlled studies in pregnant women. \n \nCytarabine, the active ingredient in DepoCyte, can cause foetal harm when administered systemically \nduring pregnancy, mainly during the first trimester.  Concern for foetal harm following intrathecal \nDepoCyte administration however, is low because systemic exposure to cytarabine is negligible. \nDespite the low apparent risk women of childbearing potential should not receive treatment until \npregnancy is excluded and should be advised to use a reliable contraceptive method. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether cytarabine is excreted in human milk following intrathecal administration. The \nsystemic exposure to free cytarabine following intrathecal treatment with DepoCyte was negligible. \nBecause of possible excretion in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin nursing infants, the use of DepoCyte is not recommended in breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nFertility studies to assess the reproductive toxicity of DepoCyte have not been conducted. Because the \nsystemic exposure to free cytarabine following intrathecal treatment with DepoCyte is negligible, the \nrisk of impaired fertility is likely to be low (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no reports explicitly relating to effects of DepoCyte treatment on the ability to drive \nor use machines. However, on the basis of reported adverse reactions, patients should be advised \nagainst driving or using machines during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn Phase 1-4 studies the most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with DepoCyte were \nheadache (23%), arachnoiditis (16%), pyrexia (14%), weakness (13%), nausea (13%), vomiting (12%), \nconfusion (11%), diarrhoea (11%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and fatigue (6%). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5  \n\n \nFor Phase 1-4 studies in patients with lymphomatous meningitis receiving either DepoCyte or \ncytarabine adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency (Very \ncommon (≥1/10); and Common (≥1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000)) in Table 1 below. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1.

Cytarabine patients not completing all 4 \ndoses within a cycle are counted as a complete cycle. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nDepoCyte has the potential of producing serious neurological toxicity. \n \nIntrathecal administration of cytarabine may cause myelopathy (3%) and other neurologic toxicities \nsometimes leading to a permanent neurological deficit. Following intrathecal administration of \nDepoCyte, serious central nervous system toxicity, including persistent convulsions (7%), extreme \nsomnolence (3%), hemiplegia (1%), visual disturbances including blindness (1%), deafness (3%) and \ncranial nerve palsies (3%) have been reported. Symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy, such as \npain (1%), numbness (3%), paresthesia (3%), hypoaesthesia (2%), weakness (13%), and impaired \nbowel (3%) and bladder control (incontinence) (1%), have also been observed and in some cases this \ncombination of neurological signs and symptoms has been reported as Cauda equina syndrome (3%). \n \nAdverse reactions possibly reflecting neurotoxicity are listed in Table 2 by MedDRA body system \norgan class and by frequency: Very common (_≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to < 1/10); and Uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100).

Toxic effects may be related to a single dose or to cumulative doses. \nBecause toxic effects can occur at any time during therapy (although they are most likely within 5 days \nof administration), patients receiving DepoCyte therapy should be monitored continuously for the \ndevelopment of neurotoxicity.  If patients develop neurotoxicity, subsequent doses of DepoCyte \nshould be reduced, and treatment should be discontinued if toxicity persists. \n \nArachnoiditis, a very common adverse reaction associated with DepoCyte, is a syndrome manifested \nby several adverse reactions. The incidence of these adverse reactions, possibly reflecting meningeal \nirritation, are headache (24%), nausea (18%), vomiting (17%), pyrexia (12%), neck stiffness (3%), \nneck pain (4%), back pain (7%), meningism (<1%), convulsions (6%), hydrocephalus (2%), and CSF \npleocytosis with or without altered state of consciousness (1%). Table 3 below lists these reactions for \npatients treated DepoCyte, and for patients treated with methotrexate and cytarabine as well. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency: Very common \n(_≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to < 1/10); and Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100).  Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7  \n\nTable 3: Adverse reactions possibly reflecting meningeal irritation in Phase II, III, and IV \npatients \nNervous system disorders \nDepoCyte (n = 929 cycles) \n \n \n \nMethotrexate (n = 258 cycles)  \n \n \nCytarabine (n = 99 cycles) \n\n \nVery common: headache \nCommon: convulsions, hydrocephalus acquired, \nCSF pleocytosis \nUncommon: meningism \nVery common: headache \nCommon: convulsions, hydrocephalus acquired, \nmeningism \nVery common: headache \nCommon: convulsions, meningism \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nDepoCyte (n = 929 cycles) \nMethotrexate (n = 258 cycles)  \nCytarabine (n = 99 cycles) \n\n \nVery common: vomiting, nausea \nVery common: vomiting, nausea \nVery common: vomiting, nausea \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \nDepoCyte (n = 929 cycles) \nMethotrexate (n = 258 cycles) \n \nCytarabine (n = 99 cycles) \n\n \n\nCommon: back pain, neck pain, neck stiffness \nCommon: back pain, neck pain \nUncommon: neck stiffness \nCommon: back pain, neck pain, neck stiffness \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \nDepoCyte (n = 929 cycles)  \nMethotrexate (n = 258 cycles) \nCytarabine (n = 99 cycles) \n\n \n\nVery common: pyrexia \nCommon: pyrexia \nVery common: pyrexia \n\n*Cycle length was 2 weeks during which the patient received either 1 dose of DepoCyte or 4 doses of \ncytarabine or methotrexate.

These reactions have been reported mainly from post-marketing experience with \nDepoCyte as spontaneous case reports. Because these reactions are reported from a population of \nuncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo overdoses with DepoCyte have been reported.  An overdose with DepoCyte may be associated \nwith severe arachnoiditis including encephalopathy. \n \nIn an early uncontrolled study without dexamethasone prophylaxis, single doses up to 125 mg were \nadministered.  One patient at the 125 mg dose level died of encephalopathy 36 hours after receiving \nDepoCyte intraventricularly.  This patient, however, was also receiving concomitant whole brain \nirradiation and had previously received intraventricular methotrexate. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8  \n\nThere is no antidote for intrathecal DepoCyte or unencapsulated cytarabine released from DepoCyte. \nExchange of cerebrospinal fluid with isotonic sodium chloride solution has been carried out in a case \nof intrathecal overdose of free cytarabine and such a procedure may be considered in the case of \nDepoCyte overdose. Management of overdose should be directed at maintaining vital functions. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimetabolites, pyrimidine analogues, ATC code: L01BC01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDepoCyte is a sustained-release formulation of cytarabine, designed for direct administration into the \ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF). \n \nCytarabine is a cell-cycle phase specific antineoplastic agent, affecting cells only during the S-phase of \ncell division. Intracellularly, cytarabine is converted into cytarabine-5’-triphosphate (ara-CTP), which \nis the active metabolite. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but it appears that ara-\nCTP acts primarily through inhibition of DNA synthesis. Incorporation into DNA and RNA may also \ncontribute to cytarabine cytotoxicity.  Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating \nmammalian cells in culture. \n \nFor cell-cycle phase specific antimetabolites the duration of exposure of neoplastic cells to cytotoxic \nconcentrations is an important determination of efficacy. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn vitro studies, examining more than 60 cell lines, demonstrated that the median cytarabine \nconcentration resulting in 50% growth inhibition (IC50) was approximately 10 µM (2.4 µg/ml) for two \ndays of exposure and 0.1 µM (0.024 µg/ml) for 6 days of exposure. The studies also demonstrated \nsusceptibility of many solid tumour cell lines to cytarabine, particularly after longer periods of \nexposure to cytarabine. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn an open-label, active-controlled, multicentre clinical study, 35 patients with lymphomatous \nmeningitis (with malignant cells found on CSF cytology) were randomised to intrathecal therapy with \neither DepoCyte (n=18) or unencapsulated cytarabine (n=17). During the 1 month Induction phase of \ntreatment, DepoCyte was administered intrathecally as 50 mg every 2 weeks, and unencapsulated \ncytarabine as 50 mg twice a week. Patients who did not respond discontinued protocol treatment after \n4 weeks. Patients who achieved a response (defined as clearing of the CSF of malignant cells in the \nabsence of progression of neurological symptoms) went on to receive Consolidation and Maintenance \ntherapy for up to 29 weeks. \n \nResponses were observed in 13/18 (72%, 95% confidence intervals: 47, 90) of DepoCyte patients \nversus 3/17 (18% patients, 95% confidence intervals: 4, 43) in the unencapsulated cytarabine arm.  A \nstatistically significant association between treatment and response was observed (Fisher’s exact test \np-value = 0.002). The majority of DepoCyte patients went on beyond Induction to receive additional \ntherapy. DepoCyte patients received a median of 5 cycles (doses) per patient (range 1 to 10 doses) with \na median time on therapy of 90 days (range 1 to 207 days). \n \nNo statistically significant differences were noted in secondary endpoints such as duration of response, \nprogression-free survival, neurological signs and symptoms, Karnofsky performance status, quality of \nlife and overall survival. Median progression-free survival (defined as time to neurological \nprogression or death) for all treated patients was 77 versus 48 days for DepoCyte versus \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9  \n\nunencapsulated cytarabine, respectively. The proportion of patients alive at 12 months was 24% for \nDepoCyte versus 19% for unencapsulated cytarabine. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn an open-label non-comparative dose escalation study in 18 paediatric patients (4 to 19 years) with \nleukaemic meningitis or neoplastic meningitis due to primary brain tumour, an intrathecal dose of \n35 mg was identified as the maximum tolerated dose. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAnalysis of the available pharmacokinetic data shows that following intrathecal DepoCyte \nadministration in patients, either via the lumbar sac or by intraventricular reservoir, peaks of free \ncytarabine were observed within 5 hours in both the ventricle and lumbar sac. These peaks were \nfollowed by a biphasic elimination profile consisting of an initial sharp decline and subsequent slow \ndecline with a terminal phase half-life of 100 to 263 hours over a dose-range of 12.5 mg to 75 mg.  In \ncontrast, intrathecal administration of 30 mg free cytarabine has shown a biphasic CSF concentration \nprofile with a terminal phase half-life of about 3.4 hours. \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters of DepoCyte (75 mg) in neoplastic meningitis patients in whom the \nmedicinal product was administered either intraventricularly or by lumbar puncture suggest that \nexposure to the active substance in the ventricular or lumbar spaces is similar regardless of the route of \nadministration. In addition, compared with free cytarabine, the formulation increases the biological \nhalf-life by a factor of 27 to 71 depending upon the route of administration and the compartment \nsampled.  Encapsulated cytarabine concentrations and the counts of the lipid particles in which the \ncytarabine is encapsulated in followed a similar distribution pattern.  AUCs of free and encapsulated \ncytarabine after ventricular injection of DepoCyte appeared to increase linearly with increasing dose, \nindicating that the release of cytarabine from DepoCyte and the pharmacokinetics of cytarabine are \nlinear in human CSF. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe transfer rate of cytarabine from CSF to plasma is slow and the conversion to uracil arabinoside \n(ara-U), the inactive metabolite, in the plasma is fast. Systemic exposure to cytarabine was determined \nto be negligible following intrathecal administration of 50 mg and 75 mg of DepoCyte. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe primary route of elimination of cytarabine is metabolism to the inactive compound ara-U, (1-β-D- \narabinofuranosyluracil or uracil arabinoside) followed by urinary excretion of ara-U. In contrast with \nsystemically administered cytarabine which is rapidly metabolised to ara-U, conversion to ara-U in the \nCSF is negligible after intrathecal administration because of the significantly lower cytidine deaminase \nactivity in the CNS tissues and CSF. The CSF clearance rate of cytarabine is similar to the CSF bulk \nflow rate of 0.24 ml/min. \n \nElimination \n \nThe distribution and clearance of cytarabine and of the predominant phospholipid component of the \nlipid particle (DOPC) following intrathecal administration of DepoCyte was evaluated in rodents. \nRadiolabels for cytarabine and DOPC were distributed rapidly throughout the neuraxis. More than \n90% of cytarabine was excreted by day 4 and an additional 2.7% by 21 days.  The results suggest that \nthe lipid components undergo hydrolysis and are largely incorporated in the tissues following \nbreakdown in the intrathecal space. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10  \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nA review of the toxicological data available for the constituent lipids (DOPC and DPPG) or similar \nphospholipids to those in DepoCyte indicates that such lipids are well tolerated in various animal \nspecies even when administered for prolonged periods at doses in the g/kg range. \n \nThe results of acute and subacute toxicity studies performed in monkeys suggested that intrathecal \nDepoCyte was tolerated up to a dose of 10 mg (comparable to a human dose of 100 mg).  Slight to \nmoderate inflammation of the meninges in the spinal cord and brain and/or astrocytic activation were \nobserved in animals receiving intrathecal DepoCyte. These changes were believed to be consistent \nwith the toxic effects of other intrathecal agents such as unencapsulated cytarabine. Similar changes \n(generally described as minimal to slight) were also observed in some animals receiving DepoFoam \nalone (DepoCyte vesicles without cytarabine) but not in sodium chloride solution control animals. \nMouse, rat and dog studies have shown that free cytarabine is highly toxic for the haemopoietic \nsystem. \n \nNo carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or impairment of fertility studies have been conducted with \nDepoCyte. The active ingredient, cytarabine, was mutagenic in in vitro tests and was clastogenic \nin vitro (chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchange in human leukocytes) and in vivo \n(chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchange assay in rodent bone marrow, mouse \nmicronucleus assay).  Cytarabine caused the transformation of hamster embryo cells and rat H43 cells \nin vitro.  Cytarabine was clastogenic to meiotic cells; a dose-dependent increase in sperm-head \nabnormalities and chromosomal aberrations occurred in mice given intraperitoneal (i.p.) cytarabine. \nNo studies assessing the impact of cytarabine on fertility are available in the literature.  Because the \nsystemic exposure to free cytarabine following intrathecal treatment with DepoCyte was negligible, \nthe risk of impaired fertility is likely to be low. \n \n \n6.

What DepoCyte is and what it is given for \n \nDepoCyte is used to treat lymphomatous meningitis. \n \nLymphomatous meningitis is a condition in which tumour cells have invaded the fluid or membranes \nthat surround the brain and spinal cord. \n \nDepoCyte is used in adults to kill lymphoma tumour cells. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given DepoCyte \n \nDepoCyte should not be given \n− if you are allergic to cytarabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n− if you have a meningeal infection. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nSevere neurological side effects have been reported with the use of DepoCyte.  Symptoms have \nincluded effects on the nervous system (e.g. convulsions, pain, numbness or tingling, blindness or \nvisual disturbances). Your doctor will check for these symptoms regularly. \n \nMake sure you take as directed any dexamethasone tablets that you may have been prescribed, as they \nreduce the risk of unwanted effects caused by DepoCyte. \n \nIf your side effects get worse or you notice any new side effects, tell your doctor. \n \nOther medicines and DepoCyte \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22  \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nDepoCyte should not be given to pregnant women as it may harm an unborn child.  Women of \nchildbearing potential should use a reliable contraceptive method to avoid pregnancy whilst being \ntreated with DepoCyte. \n \nMale patients undergoing DepoCyte treatment should use a reliable contraceptive method.  \n \nWomen should not breast-feed during treatment as DepoCyte may enter breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive during treatment. \nDo not operate any tools or machines during treatment. \n \n \n3. How DepoCyte is given \n \nA qualified and experienced doctor or physician in the treatment of cancer will inject DepoCyte in the \nspinal fluid or lumber sac. DepoCyte must not be administered by any other way. Injections are given \nslowly over 1-5 minutes and you may be asked to lie flat for one hour afterwards. \n \nYou will also be given dexamethasone, usually as tablets but possibly by intravenous injection for \n5 days after you receive each DepoCyte dose to help reduce any side effects which might occur. \n \nBefore DepoCyte is used the vial should be warmed to room temperature (18°C – 22°C) for at least \n30 minutes. Just before withdrawing DepoCyte, the vial should be gently inverted to mix the particles \nevenly. It should not be shaken vigorously. \n \nProper precautions should be taken for the handling and administration of a cytotoxic drug (proper \nhandling technique, use of a suitable designated area, protective clothing, procedures to address risk of \ncontamination). Staff who are pregnant or trying to conceive (male and female) should not work with \nDepoCyte. In the event of accidental contact with the mucous membranes, treat immediately by \ncopious washing with water; medical attention should be sought. \n \nDepoCyte should be withdrawn from the vial immediately before administration; the medicinal \nproduct should be used within 4 hours of withdrawal from the vial.
