PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule.\n\nEach capsule has a yellowish-brown, opaque cap with an \"MSD\" logo imprinted in red ink and off-\nwhite, opaque body with the code \"314\" imprinted in red ink.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nVictrelis is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infection, in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, in adult patients with compensated liver disease \nwho are previously untreated or who have failed previous therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Victrelis should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of chronic hepatitis C.\n\nPosology\n\nVictrelis must be administered in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. The Summary of \nProduct Characteristics of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (PR) must be consulted prior to initiation of\ntherapy with Victrelis.\n\nThe recommended dose of Victrelis is 800 mg administered orally three times daily (TID) with food \n(a meal or light snack). Maximum daily dose of Victrelis is 2,400 mg. Administration without food \ncould be associated with a net loss of efficacy due to sub-optimal exposure.\n\nPatients without cirrhosis who are previously untreated or who have failed previous therapy \nThe following dosing recommendations differ for some subgroups from the dosing studied in the \nPhase 3 trials (see section 5.1).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1\nDuration of therapy using Response-Guided Therapy (RGT) guidelines in patients without cirrhosis \nwho are previously untreated or who have failed previous therapy to interferon and ribavirin therapy\n\nPreviously \nUntreated \nPatients\n\nASSESSMENT*\n\n(HCV-RNA Results†) ACTION\nAt Treatment\n\nWeek 8\nAt Treatment \n\nWeek 24\n\nUndetectable Undetectable\n\nTreatment duration = 28 weeks\n\n1.

(Refer to the \nstopping rule in Table 1 for all patients.)\no The duration of the tritherapy after the first 4 weeks of bitherapy should not be less than \n\n32 weeks. Given the incremental risk of adverse events with Victrelis (anaemia notably); \nin case the patient cannot tolerate the treatment, consideration could be given to pursue \nwith 12 weeks of bitherapy for the final 12 weeks of treatment instead of tritherapy (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). For additional information on use of Victrelis in patients with \nadvanced liver disease, see section 4.4. \n\nPoorly interferon-responsive patients\nIn poorly interferon responsive patients (defined as < 1-log10 decline in HCV-RNA at TW 4) the use \nof triple therapy should be considered on a case by case basis, as the likelihood of achieving sustained \nvirologic response (SVR) with triple therapy is lower in these patients (see section 5.1).\n\nMissed doses\nIf a patient misses a dose and it is less than 2 hours before the next dose is due, the missed dose \nshould be skipped.\n\nIf a patient misses a dose and it is 2 or more hours before the next dose is due, the patient should take \nthe missed dose with food and resume the normal dosing schedule.\n\nDose reduction\nDose reduction of Victrelis is not recommended.\n\nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to peginterferon alfa and/or ribavirin, the \npeginterferon alfa and/or ribavirin dose should be reduced. Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for additional information about how to reduce \nand/or discontinue the peginterferon alfa and/or ribavirin dose. Victrelis must not be administered in \nthe absence of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nStopping rules\nDiscontinuation of therapy is recommended in all patients with 1) HCV-RNA levels of greater than or \nequal to 1,000 IU per mL at TW 8; or 2) HCV-RNA levels of greater than or equal to 100 IU per mL \nat TW 12; or 3) confirmed, detectable HCV-RNA levels at TW 24.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nClinical studies of boceprevir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to \ndetermine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other clinical experience has not \nidentified differences in responses between the older and younger patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Victrelis is required in patients with any degree of renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Victrelis is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment. Boceprevir has not been studied in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (see \nsection 5.2). For additional information on use of Victrelis in patients with advanced liver disease, see \nsection 4.4.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Victrelis in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTo obtain the hard capsules the foil of the blister should be peeled off. Victrelis is to be taken orally \nwith food (a meal or light snack).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Patients with autoimmune hepatitis.\n Co-administration with medicines that are highly dependent on CYP3A4/5 for clearance, and \n\nfor which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening \nevents such as orally administered midazolam and triazolam, bepridil, pimozide, lurasidone,\nlumefantrine, halofantrine, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, simvastatin, lovastatin, quetiapine, \nalfuzosin, silodosin, and ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, \nmethylergonovine) (see section 4.5).\n\n Pregnancy (see section 4.6).\n\nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for additional \ninformation.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAnaemia\n\nThe onset of anaemia has been reported with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy by Treatment \nWeek 4. The addition of boceprevir to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin is associated with an additional \ndecrease in haemoglobin concentrations of approximately 1 g/dL by Treatment Week 8 compared to \nstandard of care (see section 4.8). In clinical trials with the combination of Victrelis, peginterferon \nalfa-2b and ribavirin compared to peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin alone, the median time from the \ninitiation of therapy to onset of haemoglobin less than 10 g/dL was similar (71 days with a range of \n15-337 days, and 71 days with a range of 8-337 days, respectively). Complete blood counts (with \nwhite blood cell differential counts) should be obtained at pretreatment, and at Treatment \nWeeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and should be monitored closely at other time points, as clinically appropriate. If \nhaemoglobin is < 10 g/dL (or < 6.2 mmol/L) management of anaemia may be warranted (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nRibavirin dose reduction is the preferred strategy for managing treatment-emergent anaemia (see \nsection 5.1). Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for information regarding \ndose reduction and/or discontinuation of ribavirin. If permanent discontinuation of ribavirin is \nrequired, then peginterferon alfa and Victrelis must also be discontinued. \n\nIn a study comparing the use of ribavirin dose reduction and erythropoesis stimulating agents in the \nmanagement of treatment-emergent anaemia, the use of erythropoesis stimulating agents was \nassociated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events (see section 5.1).\n\nNeutropenia\n\nThe addition of boceprevir to peginterferon alfa–2b and ribavirin resulted in higher incidences of \nneutropenia and Grade 3-4 neutropenia compared with peginterferon alfa–2b and ribavirin alone (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe frequency of severe or life threatening infections tends to be higher in boceprevir-containing arms \nthan the control arm. Complete blood counts (with white blood cell differential counts) should be \nobtained at pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and should be monitored closely at other \ntime points, as clinically appropriate. Decreases in neutrophil counts may require dose reduction of \npeginterferon alfa or discontinuation of therapy. If permanent discontinuation of peginterferon alfa is \nrequired, then ribavirin and Victrelis must also be discontinued. Prompt evaluation and treatment of \ninfections is recommended.\n\nCombined use with peginterferon alfa–2a as compared to alfa–2b:\nAs compared to the combination of boceprevir with peginterferon alfa–2b and ribavirin, the \ncombination of boceprevir with peginterferon alfa–2a and ribavirin was associated with a higher rate \nof neutropenia (including grade 4 neutropenia) and a higher rate of infections.\n\nPlease refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa.\n\nPancytopenia\n\nCases of pancytopenia have been reported in patients receiving Victrelis in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Complete blood counts (with white blood cell differential counts) \nshould be obtained at pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored \nclosely at other time points, as clinically appropriate.\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nSerious, acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) have been observed during \ncombination therapy with Victrelis, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin.

If therapy is initiated, a very close \nmonitoring for signs of infections and worsening liver function is warranted.\n\nDrospirenone-containing medicines\n\nCaution should be exercised in patients taking drospirenone-containing medicines with conditions that \npredispose them to hyperkalaemia or patients taking potassium-sparing diuretics. Alternative \ncontraceptives should be considered (see section 4.5).\n\nHCV protease monotherapy\n\nBased on results of clinical studies, Victrelis must not be used alone due to the high probability of \nincreased resistance without combination anti-HCV therapies (see section 5.1).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nIt is unknown what effect therapy with Victrelis will have on the activity of subsequently \nadministered HCV protease inhibitors, including re-treatment with Victrelis.\n\nLaboratory testing\n\nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for baseline, on-\ntreatment and post-treatment laboratory testing recommendations including haematology, \nbiochemistry (including hepatic function tests), and pregnancy testing.\n\nHCV-RNA levels should be monitored at Treatment Weeks 8, 12, and 24, and for other time points as \nclinically indicated.\n\nComplete blood counts (with white blood cell differential counts) should be obtained at pretreatment, \nand at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored closely at other time points, as \nclinically appropriate.\n\nUse in patients with HIV co-infection\n\nBoceprevir, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, was evaluated in a total of \n98 patients (64 in the boceprevir arm) co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and \nHCV genotype 1 who were previously untreated for chronic HCV infection (see section 4.8 and 5.1). \nFor data regarding drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral agents, see section 4.5.\n\nUse in patients with HBV co-infection\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Victrelis alone or in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus \n(HBV) and HCV have not been studied.\n\nCases of HBV reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after treatment with \ndirect-acting antivirals not given in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.  Some cases \nhave also been reported in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon \n(refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa for more information on HBV \nreactivation in patients coinfected with HBV and HCV treated with interferon). HBV screening \nshould be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are \nat risk of HBV reactivation, and should therefore be monitored and managed according to current \nclinical guidelines.\n\nUse in patients with an organ transplant\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Victrelis alone or in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in liver or other organ transplant recipients \nhave not been studied (see section 4.5).\n\nUse in patients having HCV genotypes other than genotype 1\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Victrelis alone or in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotypes other than genotype 1 have not been established.\n\nUse in patients who have previously failed treatment with an HCV protease inhibitor\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Victrelis alone or in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection has not been studied in patients who have \nfailed previous therapy with Victrelis or other HCV protease inhibitors.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\nPotent CYP3A4 inducers\n\nThe concomitant use of Victrelis with potent CYP3A4 inducers (rifampicin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin) is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nAlpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonists\n\nCo-administration of Victrelis with alfuzosin and silodosin is contraindicated (see section 4.3). The \nconcomitant use of Victrelis with doxazosin and tamsulosin is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nProarrhythmic effects:\nThe data available (see section 5.3) warrant caution in patients at risk of QT prolongation (long \ncongenital QT, hypokalaemia).\n\nUse in patients with rare hereditary disorders\n\nVictrelis contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nVictrelis is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Medicines metabolized primarily by CYP3A4/5 may \nhave increased exposure when administered with Victrelis, which could increase or prolong their \ntherapeutic and adverse reactions (see Table 2). Victrelis does not inhibit or induce the other enzymes \nof the CYP450.\n\nBoceprevir has been shown to be a p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) \nsubstrate in vitro. There is potential for inhibitors of these transporters to increase concentrations of \nboceprevir; the clinical implications of these interactions are not known. A clinical drug interaction \nstudy with digoxin demonstrated that boceprevir is a mild P-gp inhibitor in vivo, increasing digoxin \nexposure by 19%. An increase in plasma concentrations of substrates of the P-gp efflux transporter, \nsuch as digoxin or dabigatran, should be anticipated (see table 2).\n\nVictrelis is partly metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Co-administration of Victrelis with medicines that \ninduce or inhibit CYP3A4/5 could increase or decrease exposure to Victrelis (see section 4.4).\nVictrelis, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, is contraindicated when co-\nadministered with medicines that are highly dependent on CYP3A4/5 for clearance, and for which \nelevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events such as\norally administered midazolam and triazolam, bepridil, pimozide, lurasidone, lumefantrine, \nhalofantrine, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, simvastatin, lovastatin, quetiapine, alfuzosin, silodosin, and \nergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.3).\n\nBoceprevir is primarily metabolized by aldoketo reductase (AKR). In medicine interaction trials \nconducted with AKR inhibitors diflunisal and ibuprofen, boceprevir exposure did not increase to a \nclinically significant extent. Victrelis may be co-administered with AKR inhibitors.\n\nThe concomitant use of Victrelis with rifampicin or anticonvulsants (such as phenytoin, phenobarbital \nor carbamazepine) may significantly reduce the plasma exposure of boceprevir. No data are available;\ntherefore, the combination of boceprevir with these medicines is not-recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nThe concomitant use of Victrelis with doxazosin or tamsulosin may increase plasma concentrations of \nthese medicines. The combination of boceprevir with these medicines is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nCaution should be exercised with medicines known to prolong QT interval such as amiodarone, \nquinidine, methadone, pentamidine and some neuroleptics.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9\n\nAs liver function may change during treatment with Victrelis, a close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists.\n\nTable 2 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with Victrelis. These \nrecommendations are based on either drug interaction studies (indicated with *) or predicted \ninteractions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse reactions or \nloss of efficacy.\n\nThe percent change and arrows (↑ = increase, ↓ = decrease, ↔ = no change) are used to show the \nmagnitude and direction of change in mean ratio estimate for each pharmacokinetic parameter.\n\nTable 2\nPharmacokinetic interactions data\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \nareas\n\nInteraction\n(postulated mechanism of \naction, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANALGESIC\nNarcotic analgesic/Opioid Dependence\nBuprenorphine/Naloxone*\n(buprenorphine/naloxone 8/2 –\n24/6 mg daily + Victrelis 800 mg \nthree times daily)\n\nbuprenorphine AUC ↑ 19%\nbuprenorphine Cmax ↑ 18%\nbuprenorphine Cmin ↑ 31%\n\nnaloxone AUC ↑ 33%\nnaloxone Cmax ↑ 9%\n\n(CYP3A inhibition)\n\nNo dose adjustment of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone \nor Victrelis is \nrecommended.

Therefore, female patients \nof childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after \ntreatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female partners must use an effective \ncontraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded.\n\nRefer to Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin and peginterferon alfa for additional \ninformation.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nBoceprevir/metabolites are excreted in rat milk (see section 5.3). It is not known whether boceprevir \nis excreted in human breast milk. \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy \nwith Victrelis taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy \nfor the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of Victrelis on fertility are available. Effects on fertility and Sertoli cells \nhave been observed in rats but not in mice and monkeys. Clinical data (semen analyses and inhibin B \nlevels – [a glycoprotein produced by Sertoli cells – used as a surrogate marker of testicular function]) \nshowed no evidence of altered testicular function. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in \nrats have shown effects of boceprevir/metabolites on fertility, which in females have been shown to \nbe reversible (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCombination therapy of Victrelis, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin may influence some patients’ \nability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that fatigue, dizziness, syncope, blood \npressure fluctuations and blurred vision have been reported (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety profile represented by approximately 1,500 patients for the combination of Victrelis with \npeginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin was based on pooled safety data in two clinical trials: one in \npatients who were previously untreated, and one in patients who had failed prior therapy (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were fatigue, anaemia (see section 4.4), nausea, \nheadache, and dysgeusia.\n\nThe most common reason for dose reduction was anaemia, which occurred more frequently in \nsubjects receiving the combination of Victrelis with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin than in \nsubjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin alone.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are listed by System Organ Class (see Table 3). Within each system organ class, \nadverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the categories: very common (≥ 1/10);\ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100);

Characteristics of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\n‡ Injection-site reactions have not been included since Victrelis is administered orally.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAnaemia (see section 4.4)\nAnaemia was observed in 49% of subjects treated with the combination of Victrelis with \npeginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin compared with 29% of subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b \nand ribavirin alone. Victrelis was associated with an additional decrease of approximately 1 g/dL in \nhaemoglobin concentration (see section 4.4). The mean decreases in haemoglobin values from \nbaseline were larger in previously treated patients compared to patients who had never received prior \ntherapy. Dose modifications due to anaemia/haemolytic anaemia occurred twice as often in patients \ntreated with the combination of Victrelis with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (26%) compared to \npeginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin alone (13%). In clinical trials, the proportion of subjects who \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22\n\nreceived erythropoietin for the management of anaemia was 43% (667/1,548) of subjects in the \nVictrelis-containing arms compared to 24% (131/547) of subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b and \nribavirin alone. The majority of the anaemia subjects received erythropoietin when haemoglobin \nlevels were ≤ 10 g/dL (or 6.2 mmol/L). The proportion of subjects who received a transfusion for the \nmanagement of anaemia was 3% of subjects in the Victrelis-containing arms compared to < 1% of \nsubjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin alone.\n\nNeutrophils (see section 4.4)\nThe proportion of subjects with decreased neutrophils was higher in the Victrelis-containing arms \ncompared to subjects receiving only peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. The percentage of patients \nwith Grades 3-4 neutropenia (neutrophil counts < 0.75 x 109/L) was higher in boceprevir-treated \npatients (29%) than in placebo-treated patients (17%), in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and \nribavirin. Seven percent of subjects receiving the combination of Victrelis with peginterferon alfa-2b \nand ribavirin had neutrophil counts of < 0.5 x 109/L (Grade 4 neutropenia) compared to 4% of \nsubjects receiving only peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n\nCombined use with peginterferon alfa–2a see specific section in section 4.4.\n\nPlatelets\nPlatelet counts were decreased for subjects in the Victrelis containing-arms (3%) compared to \nsubjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin alone (1%). In both treatment arms, patients \nwith cirrhosis were at a higher risk to experience Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia compared with non \ncirrhotic patients.\n\nOther laboratory findings\nThe addition of Victrelis to peginterferon alfa–2b and ribavirin was associated to higher incidences of \nincrease in uric acid, triglycerides and cholesterol total compared to peginterferon alfa–2b and \nribavirin only.\n\nPatients with HIV co-infection\nThe safety profile of Victrelis in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients (n=64) was overall similar to the \nsafety profile in mono-infected HCV patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDaily doses of 3,600 mg have been taken by healthy volunteers for 5 days without untoward \nsymptomatic effects. There is no specific antidote for overdose with Victrelis. Treatment of overdose \nwith Victrelis should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs, and \nobservation of the patient’s clinical status.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE12\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBoceprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3 protease. Boceprevir covalently, yet reversibly, binds to \nthe NS3 protease active site serine (Ser139) through a (alpha)-ketoamide functional group to inhibit \nviral replication in HCV-infected host cells.\n\nAntiviral activity in cell culture\n\nThe antiviral activity of boceprevir was evaluated in a biochemical assay for slow binding inhibitors \nof NS3 protease and in the genotype 1a and 1b HCV replicon system. The IC50 and IC90 values for \nboceprevir against different genotype 1b replicons ranged from 200 to 600 nM and 400 to 900 nM, \nrespectively, in a 72-hour cell culture assay. Loss of replicon RNA appears to be first-order with \nrespect to time of treatment. Treatment at IC90 for 72 hours resulted in a 1-log10 drop in replicon RNA. \nProlonged exposure resulted in a 2-log decrease in RNA levels by Day 15. In a genotype 1a replicon, \nthe IC50 and IC90 values for boceprevir were 900 nM and 1,400 nM, respectively.\n\nEvaluation of varying combinations of boceprevir and interferon alfa-2b that produced 90% \nsuppression of replicon RNA showed additivity of effect; no evidence of synergy or antagonism was \ndetected.\n\nResistance\n\nThe activity of boceprevir against the HCV genotype 1a replicon was reduced (2- to 6-fold) by the \nfollowing amino acid substitutions in the NS3 protease domain: V36A/L/M, Q41R, T54A/S, V55A, \nR155K and V158I. A greater than 10-fold reduction in boceprevir susceptibility was conferred by the \namino acid substitutions R155T and A156S. The V55I and D168N single substitutions did not reduce \nsensitivity to boceprevir. The following double amino acid substitutions conferred more than 10-fold \nreduced sensitivity to boceprevir: V55A+I170V, T54S+R155K, R155K+D168N, R155T+D168N and \nV36M+R155K.\n\nThe activity of boceprevir against the HCV genotype 1b replicon was reduced (2- to 8-fold) by the \nfollowing amino acid substitutions in the NS3 protease domain: V36A/M, F43S, T54A/G/S, V55A, \nR155K/G, V158I, V170M and M175L. A greater than 10-fold reduction in boceprevir susceptibility \nwas conferred by the amino acid substitutions A156S/T/V, V170A, R155W+A156G and \nV36M+R155K. The D168V single substitution did not reduce sensitivity to boceprevir.\n\nIn a pooled analysis of subjects who were previously untreated and subjects who have failed previous \ntherapy who received four weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin followed by boceprevir\n800 mg three times daily in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in two Phase III \nstudies, post-baseline RAVs were detected in 15% of all subjects. In boceprevir-treated subjects who \ndid not attain sustained virologic response (SVR) for whom samples were analysed, 53% had post-\nbaseline RAVs detected. \n\nThe most frequently (> 25% of subjects) detected post-baseline RAVs in these subjects were amino \nacid substitutions V36M (61%) and R155K (68%) in subjects infected with genotype 1a viruses and \nT54A (42%), T54S (37%), A156S (26%) and V170A (32%) in subjects infected with genotype 1b \nviruses.\n\nIn subjects treated with boceprevir, interferon responsiveness (as defined by ≥ 1-log10 decline in viral \nload at Treatment Week 4) was associated with detection of fewer RAVs, with 6% of these subjects \nhaving RAVs compared to 41% of subjects with < 1-log10 decline in viral load at Treatment Week 4 \n(poorly interferon responsive).\n\nIn subjects treated with boceprevir who did not achieve SVR and with post-baseline samples analysed \nfor RAVs, interferon responsiveness was associated with detection of fewer RAVs, with 31% of these \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24\n\nsubjects having post-baseline RAVs compared to 69% of subjects with < 1-log10 decline in viral load \nat Treatment Week 4. \n\nRAVs were detected in 8% of patients at baseline by population sequencing. Overall, the presence of \nbaseline RAVs did not appear to have a notable association with treatment response in subjects \nreceiving the combination of boceprevir with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n\nHowever, among poorly interferon-responsive patients to peginterferon alfa–2b/ribavirin during the \n4-week lead-in period, the efficacy of boceprevir appeared to be reduced for those who had variants \nV36M, T54S, V55A or R155K detected at baseline. Subjects with these baseline variants and reduced \nresponse to peginterferon alfa–2b/ribavirin represented approximately 1% of the total number of \nsubjects treated with boceprevir.\n\nFollow-up analysis of boceprevir-treated subjects who did not achieve SVR showed that the \npopulation of wild-type virus increased and the majority of boceprevir-resistant variants became \nundetectable over time after the end of boceprevir treatment. Of 314 treatment-naïve and previously \ntreated subjects who did not achieve SVR from Phase 2/3 studies (P03523, P03659, P05216, and \nP05101) in whom boceprevir-resistant variants had emerged during treatment, 73% (228/314) of \nsubjects no longer had any RAVs detected at the boceprevir-resistance associated loci by population \nsequencing within 3 years post-therapy. Among the variants, 91% of V36M, 98% of T54A, 71% of \nT54S, 78% of V55A, 76% of R155K, 92% of A156S, 96% of I/V170A, 77% of R155K+T54S and \n95% of R155K+V36M were undetectable by population sequencing. The median time for all RAVs to \nbecome undetectable was 1.11 years.\n\nAmong the 314 subjects, 230 were infected with genotype 1a HCV and 84 were infected with \ngenotype 1b HCV. Seventy percent (70%) (162/230) of genotype 1a subjects no longer had any RAVs \ndetected at the boceprevir-resistance associated loci by population sequencing. The median time for \nall RAVs to become undetectable was 1.17 years for genotype 1a. The median times for the most \nrelevant boceprevir-resistant variants observed in genotype 1a patients (> 10%) to become \nundetectable were as follows: R155K+V36M, 0.69 years; V36M, 0.89 years; R155K+T54S, \n1.05 years; R155K, 1.08 years; and T54S, 1.14 years. In comparison, 79% (66/84) of genotype 1b \nsubjects no longer had any RAVs detected at the boceprevir-resistance associated loci by population \nsequencing. The median time for all RAVs to become undetectable was 1.04 years for genotype 1b. \nThe median times for the most relevant boceprevir-resistant variants observed in genotype 1b patients \n(> 10%) to become undetectable were as follows: I/V170A, 0.46 years; T54A, 0.47 years; V55A, \n0.83 years; A156S, 0.89 years; and T54S, 1.11 years.\n\nEfficacy\n\nThe efficacy of Victrelis as a treatment for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection was assessed in \napproximately 1,500 adult subjects who were previously untreated (SPRINT-2) or who had failed \nprevious therapy (RESPOND-2) in Phase III clinical studies. In both studies, the addition of Victrelis\nto the current standard of care (peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) significantly increased sustained \nvirologic response (SVR) rates compared to the current standard of care alone. It should be noted that \nretrospective analyses bridging the data between the two pivotal studies have led to a recommended \nposology that differs from the regimen studied in some patient subgroups.\n\nPatients who are previously untreated\n\nSPRINT-2 (P05216) was a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study comparing two \ntherapeutic regimens of Victrelis 800 mg orally three times daily in combination with PR \n[peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 µg/kg/week subcutaneously and weight-based dosing with ribavirin (600-\n1,400 mg/day orally divided twice daily)] to PR alone in adult subjects who had chronic hepatitis C \nHCV genotype 1 infection with detectable levels of HCV-RNA and were not previously treated with \ninterferon alfa therapy.

The distribution of \nsubjects by gender was 67% men and 33% women.\n**Relapse rate was the proportion of subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA at End of Treatment \n(EOT) and detectable HCV-RNA at End of Follow-up (EOF) among subjects who were undetectable \nat EOT and not missing EOF data.\n*** Null responder: subject who had less than a 2-log10 HCV-RNA decline by treatment week 12 with \npeginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n**** Partial Responder: subject who failed to achieve SVR after at least 12 weeks of previous \ntreatment with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, but demonstrated a ≥ 2 log10 reduction in HCV-\nRNA by Week 12 and had detectable HCV-RNA at End of Treatment (EOT).\n† Relapser: subject who failed to achieve SVR after at least 12 weeks of previous treatment with \npeginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, but had undetectable HCV-RNA at the end of treatment.\n§ SVR: defined as undetectable1 plasma HCV-RNA at Follow-up Week (FW) 24. If other HCV-RNA \nvalues were available after FW 24, the last available value in the period after FW 24 was used. If \nthere were no such values at and after FW 24, the FW 12 value was used.\n\nLong-term efficacy data\n\nA 3-year follow-up study of subjects who achieved SVR with a Victrelis-based regimen showed that \n> 99% (693/696) of patients maintained their SVR (no relapse) through the available follow-up period \n(median duration of 3.4 years).\n\nExploratory pharmacogenomic analysis of IL28B in phase 3 studies of Victrelis\n\nA genetic variant near the gene encoding interferon-lambda-3 (IL28B rs12979860, a C to T change) is \na strong predictor of response to peginterferon alfa–2b/ribavirin. IL28B rs12979860 was genotyped in \n653 of 1,048 (62%) subjects in SPRINT-2 (previously untreated) and 259 of 394 (66%) subjects in \nRESPOND-2 (previous treatment failure) [see section 5.1 for the clinical trial descriptions]. The \nresults of this retrospective subgroup analysis should be viewed with caution because of the small \nsample size and potential differences of the sub-study population relative to the overall trial \npopulation.\n\nThe degree of added value of Victrelis on top of the bitherapy in C/C patients will depend on the \nlikelihood of achieving SVR with the bitherapy only. In C/C patients receiving tritherapy 89% in \ntreatment naive were HCV-RNA undetectable by TW 8 and eligible for shorter duration of therapy as \ncompared to 52% in treatment naïve non C/C.\n\n                                                     \n\n1\nIn clinical trials, HCV-RNA in plasma was measured with a Roche COBAS Taqman assay with a limit of detection of 9.3 IU/mL and a \n\nlimit of quantification of 25 IU/mL.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33\n\nTable 10\nSustained Virologic Response (SVR) rates by IL28B rs12979860 genotype\n\nClinical Study\nIL28B rs12979860\n\nGenotype\nPR48*\n\nSVR, % (n/N)\nVictrelis-RGT*\nSVR, % (n/N)\n\nVictrelis-PR48*\nSVR, % (n/N)\n\nSPRINT-2 \n(previously \nuntreated \nsubjects)\n\nC/C 78 (50/64) 82 (63/77) 80 (44/55)\nC/T 28 (33/116) 65 (67/103) 71 (82/115)\n\nT/T 27 (10/37) 55 (23/42) 59 (26/44)\n\nRESPOND-2 \n(subjects who \nhave failed \nprevious therapy)\n\nC/C 46 (6/13) 79 (22/28) 77 (17/22)\n\nC/T 17 (5/29) 61 (38/62) 73 (48/66)\n\nT/T 50 (5/10) 55 (6/11) 72 (13/18)\n\n*Please see section 5.1 clinical trial descriptions for each treatment arm.\n\nWhether on treatment early viral response and/or IL28B genotype could reliably identify those \npatients who are unlikely to retrieve significant benefit of boceprevir (higher SVR rates or short \ncourse treatment duration) on top of the bitherapy is currently under investigation.\n\nUse of ribavirin dose reduction versus erythropoietin in the management of anaemia in previously \nuntreated subjects\n\nA randomized, parallel-arm, open-label study (P06086) was conducted to compare two strategies for \nthe management of anaemia (use of erythropoietin versus ribavirin dose reduction) in 687 subjects \nincluding 60 cirrhotic patients with previously untreated CHC genotype 1 infection who became \nanaemic during therapy with Victrelis 800 mg orally three times daily in combination with PR \n[peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 µg/kg/week subcutaneously and weight-based ribavirin (600  1,400 mg \nBID) orally divided twice daily]. \n\nIf serum haemoglobin concentrations continued to decrease to ≤ 8.5 g/dL, subjects could be treated \nwith additional anaemia interventions, including the use of erythropoietin or ribavirin dose reduction.\n\nThe SVR rates in subjects randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction and randomized to receive \nerythropoietin were comparable. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34\n\nTable 11\nSustained Virologic Response (SVR) * and Relapse† Rates for using ribavirin dose reduction versus \n\nerythropoietin in the management of anaemia in previously untreated subjects\n\nSubjects randomized to receive \nribavirin dose reduction (N=249)\n\nSubjects randomized to receive \nerythropoietin (N=251)\n\nSVR‡ % (n/N) 71.5% (178/249) 70.9% (178/251)\nRelapse % (n/N) 9.7% (19/196) 9.6% (19/197)\n\n* The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all subjects who became anaemic (serum haemoglobin of \napproximately ≤10 g/dL within the treatment period) and were randomized to using either ribavirin \ndose reduction or erythropoietin (N=500). Mean age of subjects randomized was 49 years. The race \ndistribution of subjects was as follows: 77% White, 19% Black, and 4% others. The distribution of \nsubjects by genders was 37% men and 63% women. \n\n†  Relapse rate was the proportion of subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA at End of Treatment \n(EOT) and detectable HCV-RNA at End of Follow-up (EOF) among subjects who were \nundetectable at EOT and not missing EOF data.\n\n‡  SVR: defined as undetectable1 plasma HCV-RNA at Follow-up Week (FW) 24. If other HCV-RNA \nvalues were available after FW 24, the last available value in the period after FW 24 was used. If \nthere were no such values at and after FW 24, the FW 12 value was used. SVR rates with \n“missing=failure” approach were similar to those in the table: 69.9% (174/249) for subjects \nrandomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction; 68.5% (172/251) for subjects randomized to receive \nerythropoietin.\n\nThere were 77 subjects who received ≥ 5 steps ribavirin dose reduction for the management of \nanaemia. For most of these subjects (n=54), the lowest dose of ribavirin received for at least 14 days \nwas ≥ 600mg/day. A limited number of subjects (n=12) received ≤ 200mg/day of ribavirin for at least \n14 days.\n\nThe treatment discontinuation rate due to anaemia was 2% (5/249) in subjects randomized to receive \nribavirin dose reduction and 2% (6/251) in subjects randomized to receive erythropoietin. The \ntransfusion rate was 4% (10/249) in subjects randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction and 2% \n(5/251) in subjects randomized to receive erythropoietin.\n\nThe use of erythropoesis stimulating agents was associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic \nevents including pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and \ndeep vein thrombosis.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nVictrelis in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic viral hepatitis C (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nBoceprevir was absorbed following oral administration with a median Tmax of 2 hours. Steady state \nAUC, Cmax and Cmin increased in a less-than dose-proportional manner and individual exposures \noverlapped substantially at 800 mg and 1,200 mg, suggesting diminished absorption at higher doses. \nAccumulation is minimal and pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved after approximately 1 day of\nthree times daily dosing.\n\n                                                     \n\n1\nIn clinical trials, HCV-RNA in plasma was measured with a Roche COBAS Taqman assay with a limit of detection of 9.3 IU/mL and a \n\nlimit of quantification of 25 IU/mL.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35\n\nIn healthy subjects who received 800 mg three times daily alone, boceprevir medicine exposure was\ncharacterized by AUC(т) of 6,147 ng.hr/mL, Cmax of 1,913 ng/mL, and Cmin of 90 ng/mL. \nPharmacokinetic results were similar between healthy subjects and HCV-infected subjects.\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of Victrelis has not been studied.\n\nEffects of food on oral absorption\n\nVictrelis should be administered with food. Food enhanced the exposure of boceprevir by up to 60% \nat the 800 mg three times daily dose when administered with a meal relative to the fasting state. The \nbioavailability of boceprevir is regardless of meal type (e.g., high-fat vs. low-fat) or whether taken \n5 minutes prior to eating, during a meal, or immediately following completion of the meal. \n\nDistribution\n\nBoceprevir has a mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of approximately 772 l at steady state. \nHuman plasma protein binding is approximately 75% following a single dose of Victrelis 800 mg.\nBoceprevir is administered as an approximately equal mixture of two diastereomers which rapidly \ninterconvert in plasma. At steady-state, the exposure ratio for the two diastereomers is \napproximately 2:1, with the predominant diastereomer being pharmacologically active.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nStudies in vitro indicate that boceprevir primarily undergoes metabolism through the aldo-\nketoreductase (AKR)-mediated pathway to ketone-reduced metabolites that are inactive against HCV. \nAfter a single 800 mg oral dose of 14C-boceprevir, the most abundant circulating metabolites were a \ndiasteriomeric mixture of ketone-reduced metabolites with a mean exposure approximately 4fold \ngreater than that of boceprevir. Boceprevir also undergoes, to a lesser extent, oxidative metabolism \nmediated by CYP3A4/5.\n\nElimination\n\nBoceprevir is eliminated with a mean plasma half-life (t½) of approximately 3.4 hours. Boceprevir \nhas a mean total body clearance (CL/F) of approximately 161 l/hr. Following a single 800 mg oral \ndose of 14C-boceprevir, approximately 79% and 9% of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, \nrespectively, with approximately 8% and 3% of the dosed radiocarbon eliminated as boceprevir in \nfaeces and urine. The data indicate that boceprevir is eliminated primarily by the liver.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn a study of patients with varying degrees of stable chronic liver impairment (mild, moderate and \nsevere), no clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were found, and no dose \nadjustment is recommended. For additional information on use of Victrelis in patients with advanced \nliver disease, see section 4.4.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between patients \nwith end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and healthy subjects. Boceprevir is not eliminated by dialysis. \nNo dose adjustment is required in these patients and in patients with any degree of renal impairment.\n\nGender\nNo gender-related pharmacokinetic differences in the phase III studies have been observed in adult \npatients.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36\n\nRace\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of Victrelis indicated that race had no apparent effect on \nexposure.\n\nAge\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of Victrelis indicated that age had no apparent effect on \nexposure.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn an in vitro dog Purkinje fiber study, boceprevir prolonged the action potential duration with inverse \nfrequency dependence; the clinical relevance remains uncertain.\n\nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies boceprevir showed testicular degeneration in rats at systemic exposures \nlower than those in humans at the recommended human therapeutic dose. This is not observed in mice \nor monkeys.\n\nBoceprevir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, human peripheral blood lymphocyte and mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nIn 2-year carcinogenicity studies, no carcinogenicity was observed, but there was an increased \nincidence of hepatocellular adenomas in mice, which was not statistically significant, at systemic \nexposures 5.7-fold higher than those in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose. No carcinomas \nor adenomas were observed in rats. The hepatocellular tumours are considered due to enzyme \ninduction and therefore not relevant for humans.\n\nBoceprevir/medicine derived material was shown to be transferred into the milk of lactating rats. \nExposure to boceprevir in nursing human infants is estimated to be less than 1% of the dose.\n\nIn rats, boceprevir induced reversible effects on fertility and early embryonic development in female \nrats at exposures 1.2-fold the human exposure at the recommended therapeutic dose. Decreased \nfertility was also observed in male rats, most likely as a consequence of testicular degeneration (no \ntesticular degeneration has been observed in mice or monkeys). Boceprevir was shown to be devoid of \nembryonic or teratogenic potential in both rats and rabbits at maternotoxic dose levels.\n\nData obtained in juvenile rats suggest that the pharmacokinetic profile of boceprevir may be different \nthan in adult rats, possibly due to immaturity of some metabolic pathways. No clinical paediatric \nexposure data is available (see section 4.2).\n\n6.

Please see \"Possible side effects\" for more information.\n\nTests\nYour doctor will have your blood tested regularly. These blood tests are done for a number of reasons:\n so your doctor knows if the treatment is working for you\n to help your doctor decide how long you will be treated with Victrelis.\n to check for side effects.\n\nOther medicines and Victrelis\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.\n\nIn particular, do not take Victrelis if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n alfuzosin and silodosin – used to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate\n bepridil – used for heart problems\n pimozide or lurasidone – used for mental health problems\n oral midazolam or oral triazolam – a sedative, given by mouth\n statins – simvastatin or lovastatin\n ‘ergot’ type medicines, such as dihydro-ergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine or \n\nmethylergonovine – used for migraine and cluster headaches\n lumefantrine and halofantrine – anti-malaria medicines\n quetiapine - used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder\n tyrosine kinase inhibitors – used as anti-cancer medicines\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54\n\nDo not take Victrelis if you are taking any of the medicines above.

Ribavirin can be very damaging \nto an unborn baby. Therefore, you and your partner must take special precautions in sexual activity if \nthere is any chance for pregnancy to occur:\n\n- if you are a woman of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin:\nyou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for \nthe 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective birth control during the time \nyou are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. This should be discussed \nwith your doctor. \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin:\ndo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the \npossibility for ribavirin to be left in the woman's body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nbut is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and \nfor the 7 months after treatment has stopped. You or your partner must use an effective birth \ncontrol during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This \nshould be discussed with your doctor.\n\nIt is possible that boceprevir is excreted in human milk. If you are breast-feeding, your doctor will \nadvise you to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Victrelis while breast-feeding.\n\nReminder: Please also read the “Pregnancy and breast-feeding” section of the Package Leaflets for \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin before you start taking Victrelis.\n\nDriving and using machines\nVictrelis does not affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. However, the combination \ntherapy of Victrelis, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin may make you feel tired, faint, a sensation of \nyour head spinning, changes in blood pressure, confused or difficulty seeing clearly.
