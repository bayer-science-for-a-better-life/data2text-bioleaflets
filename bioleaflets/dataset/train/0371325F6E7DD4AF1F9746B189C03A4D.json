CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nAdults\nOlanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n\nOlanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in \npatients who have shown an initial treatment response.\n\nOlanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode.\n\nIn patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment, olanzapine is indicated for \nthe prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nAdults\nSchizophrenia: The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg/day.\n\nManic episode: The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in \ncombination therapy (see section 5.1).\n\nPreventing recurrence in bipolar disorder: The recommended starting dose is 10 mg/day. For \npatients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode, continue therapy for \npreventing recurrence at the same dose. If a new manic, mixed, or depressive episode occurs, \nolanzapine treatment should be continued (with dose optimisation as needed), with supplementary \ntherapy to treat mood symptoms, as clinically indicated.\n\nDuring treatment for schizophrenia, manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder, \ndaily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the \nrange 5-20 mg/day. An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised \n\n\n\n4\n\nonly after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than \n24 hours. \nOlanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food. Gradual \ntapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nA lower starting dose (5 mg/day) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 \nand over when clinical factors warrant (see also section 4.4).\n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment\nA lower starting dose (5 mg) should be considered for such patients. In cases of moderate hepatic \ninsufficiency (cirrhosis, Child-Pugh Class A or B), the starting dose should be 5 mg and only \nincreased with caution.\n\nSmokers\nThe starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers.\nThe metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking. Clinical monitoring is recommended \nand an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.5).\n\nWhen more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism (female gender, \ngeriatric age, non-smoking status), consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose. \nDose escalation, when indicated, should be conservative in such patients.\n\n(See sections 4.5 and 5.2.)\n\nPaediatric population\nOlanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a \nlack of data on safety and efficacy. A greater magnitude of weight gain, lipid and prolactin \nalterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult \npatients (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nPatients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several \ndays to some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored during this period.\n\nDementia-related psychosis and/or behavioural disturbances\nOlanzapine is not recommended for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis and/or \nbehavioural disturbances because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular \naccident. In placebo-controlled clinical trials (6-12 weeks duration) of elderly patients (mean age \n78 years) with dementia-related psychosis and/or disturbed behaviours, there was a 2-fold increase \nin the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo \n(3.5% vs. 1.5%, respectively). The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine \ndose (mean daily dose 4.4 mg) or duration of treatment. Risk factors that may predispose this \npatient population to increased mortality include age > 65 years, dysphagia, sedation, malnutrition \nand dehydration, pulmonary conditions (e.g., pneumonia, with or without aspiration), or \nconcomitant use of benzodiazepines. However, the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-\ntreated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors.\n\n\n\n5\n\nIn the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e.g., stroke, transient ischemic \nattack), including fatalities, were reported. There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated \nwith olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo (1.3% vs. 0.4%, respectively). All \nolanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing \nrisk factors. Age > 75 years and vascular/mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for \nCVAE in association with olanzapine treatment. The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in \nthese trials.\n\nParkinson's disease\nThe use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with \nParkinson's disease is not recommended. In clinical trials, worsening of Parkinsonian \nsymptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with \nplacebo (see section 4.8), and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of \npsychotic symptoms. In these trials, patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest \neffective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products (dopamine agonist) and to remain on the \nsame anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study. Olanzapine was \nstarted at 2.5 mg/day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg/day based on investigator judgement.\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\nNMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal products. \nRare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine. Clinical \nmanifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of \nautonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac \ndysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria \n(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of \nNMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, \nall antipsychotic medicines, including olanzapine must be discontinued.\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes\nHyperglycaemia and/or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with \nketoacidosis or coma has been reported uncommonly, including some fatal cases (see section 4.8). \nIn some cases, a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing \nfactor. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic \nguidelines, e.g. measuring of blood glucose at baseline, 12 weeks after starting olanzapine \ntreatment and annually thereafter. Patients treated with any antipsychotic medicines, including \nZalasta, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, \npolyuria, polyphagia, and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for \ndiabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Weight should be \nmonitored regularly, e.g. at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and \nquarterly thereafter.\n\nLipid alterations\nUndesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials (see section 4.8). Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically \nappropriate, particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the \ndevelopment of lipids disorders. Patients treated with any antipsychotic medicines, including \nZalasta, should be monitored regularly for lipids in accordance with utilised antipsychotic \nguidelines, e.g. at baseline, 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and every 5 years \nthereafter.\n\nAnticholinergic activity\nWhile olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro, experience during the clinical \ntrials revealed a low incidence of related events. However, as clinical experience with olanzapine in \npatients with concomitant illness is limited, caution is advised when prescribing for patients with \nprostatic hypertrophy, or paralytic ileus and related conditions.\n\n\n\n6\n\nHepatic function\nTransient, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic aminotransferases, ALT, AST have been seen \ncommonly, especially in early treatment. Caution should be exercised and follow-up organised in \npatients with elevated ALT and/or AST, in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic \nimpairment, in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional \nreserve, and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines. In cases \nwhere hepatitis (including hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed liver injury) has been diagnosed, \nolanzapine treatment should be discontinued.\n\nNeutropenia\nCaution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/or neutrophil counts for any reason, \nin patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-\ninduced bone marrow depression/toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by \nconcomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic \nconditions or with myeloproliferative disease. Neutropenia has been reported commonly when \nolanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly (see section 4.8).\n\nDiscontinuation of treatment\nAcute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea, or vomiting have been \nreported rarely \u2265 0.01% and < 0.1%) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly.\n\nQT interval\nIn clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] \u2265 500 \nmilliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF< 500 msec) were \nuncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in \nassociated cardiac events compared to placebo. However, caution should be exercised when \nolanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, \nin patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, \nhypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.\n\nThromboembolism\nTemporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has been reported\nuncommonly (\u2265 0.1% and < 1%). A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous \nthromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established. However, since patients \nwith schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all \npossible risk factors of VTE e.g. immobilisation of patients, should be identified and preventive \nmeasures undertaken.\n\nGeneral CNS activity\nGiven the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when it is taken in \ncombination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol. As it exhibits in vitro dopamine \nantagonism, olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists.\n\nSeizures\nOlanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to \nfactors which may lower the seizure threshold. Seizures have been reported to occur uncommonly \nin patients when treated with olanzapine. In most of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors \nfor seizures was reported.\n\nTardive Dyskinesia\nIn comparator studies of one year or less duration, olanzapine was associated with a statistically \nsignificant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia. However the risk of tardive \ndyskinesia increases with long term exposure, and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive \ndyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be \nconsidered.\nThese symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment.\n\n\n\n7\n\nPostural hypotension\nPostural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials. It is \nrecommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years.\n\nSudden cardiac death \nIn postmarketing reports with olanzapine, the event of sudden cardiac death has been reported in \npatients with olanzapine. In a retrospective observational cohort study, the risk of presumed sudden \ncardiac death in patients treated with olanzapine was approximately twice the risk in patients not \nusing antipsychotics. In the study, the risk of olanzapine was comparable to the risk of atypical \nantipsychotics included in a pooled analysis.\n\nPaediatric population\nOlanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents. Studies in patients \naged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions, including weight gain, changes in metabolic \nparameters and increases in prolactin levels (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nLactose\nZalasta tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nPotential interactions affecting olanzapine\nSince olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2, substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this \nisoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.\n\nInduction of CYP1A2\nThe metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine, which may lead to \nreduced olanzapine concentrations. Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has \nbeen observed. The clinical consequences are likely to be limited, but clinical monitoring is \nrecommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nInhibition of CYP1A2\nFluvoxamine, a specific CYP 1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism \nof olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54% in female \nnon-smokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52% and 108% \nrespectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using \nfluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as ciprofloxacin. A decrease in the dose of \nolanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP 1A2 is initiated.\n\nDecreased bioavailability\nActivated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60% and should be taken \nat least 2 hours before or after olanzapine.\n\nFluoxetine (a CYP2D6 inhibitor), single doses of antacid (aluminium, magnesium) or cimetidine \nhave not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.\n\nPotential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products\nOlanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists.\n\nOlanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro (e.g. 1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, \n3A4). Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no \ninhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant \n(representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or \ndiazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).\n\n\n\n8\n\nOlanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden.\n\nTherapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage \nadjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine.\n\nGeneral CNS activity\nCaution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that \ncan cause central nervous system depression.\n\nThe concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with \nParkinson's disease and dementia is not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nQTc interval\nCaution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products \nknown to increase QTc interval (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Patients should be advised \nto notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment \nwith olanzapine. Nevertheless, because human experience is limited, olanzapine should be used in \npregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nNew born infants exposed to antipsychotics (including olanzapine) during the third trimester of \npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms \nthat may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, \nhypertonia, hypotonis, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, \nnewborns should be monitored carefully.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIn a study in breast-feeding, healthy women, olanzapine was excreted in breast milk. Mean infant \nexposure (mg/kg) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8% of the maternal olanzapine dose \n(mg/kg). Patients should be advised not to breast feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine.\n\nFertility\nEffects on fertility are unknown (see section 5.3 for preclinical information).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\nBecause olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness, patients should be cautioned about \noperating machinery, including motor vehicles.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nAdults\nThe most frequently (seen in \u2265 1% of patients) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of \nolanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, \ncholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, \ndizziness, akathisia, parkinsonism, leukopenia, neutropenia (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic \nhypotension, anticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic \naminotransferases (see section 4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue, pyrexia, arthralgia, increased alkaline \nphosphatase, high gamma glutamyltransferase, high uric acid, high creatine phosphokinase and \noedema.\n\n\n\n9\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following table lists the adverse reactions and laboratory investigations observed from \nspontaneous reporting and in clinical trials. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. The frequency terms listed are defined as follows: Very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the data available).\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Not known\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders\n\nEosinophilia\nLeukopenia10\n\nNeutropenia10\n\nThrombocytopenia1\n1\n\nImmune system disorders\nHypersensitivity11\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nWeight gain1 Elevated cholesterol \n\nlevels2,3\n\nElevated glucose \nlevels4\n\nElevated triglyceride \nlevels2,5\n\nGlucosuria\nIncreased appetite\n\nDevelopment or \nexacerbation of \ndiabetes occasionally \nassociated with \nketoacidosis or coma, \nincluding some fatal \ncases (see section \n4.4)11\n\nHypothermia12\n\nNervous system disorders\nSomnolence Dizziness\n\nAkathisia6\n\nParkinsonism6\n\nDyskinesia6\n\nSeizures where in most \ncases a history of \nseizures or risk factors \nfor seizures were \nreported11\n\nDystonia (including \noculogyration)11\n\nTardive dyskinesia11\n\nAmnesia9\n\nDysarthria\nStuttering11\n\nRestless legs \nsyndrome11\n\nNeuroleptic \nmalignant \nsyndrome (see \nsection 4.4)12\n\nDiscontinuation \nsymptoms7, 12\n\nCardiac disorders\nBradycardia\nQTc prolongation (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nVentricular \ntachycardia/fibrillat\nion, sudden death \n(see section 4.4)11\n\nVascular disorders\nOrthostatic \nhypotension10\n\nThromboembolism \n(including pulmonary \nembolism and deep \nvein thrombosis) (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nEpistaxis9\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nMild, transient \nanticholinergic effects \nincluding constipation \nand dry mouth\n\nAbdominal distension9\n\nSalivary \nhypersecretion11\n\nPancreatitis11\n\n\n\n10\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nTransient, \nasymptomatic \nelevations of hepatic \naminotransferases \n(ALT, AST), \nespecially in early \ntreatment (see section \n4.4)\n\nHepatitis (including \nhepatocellular,\ncholestatic or \nmixed liver \ninjury)11\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nRash Photosensitivity \n\nreaction\nAlopecia\n\nDrug Reaction \nwith \nEosinophilia and \nSystemic \nSymptoms \n(DRESS)\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nArthralgia9 Rhabdomyolysis11\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nUrinary incontinence, \nurinary retention\nUrinary hesitation11\n\nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions\nDrug \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \nneonatal (see \nsection 4.6)\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nErectile dysfunction in \nmales\nDecreased libido in \nmales and females\n\nAmenorrhea\nBreast enlargement\nGalactorrhea in \nfemales \nGynaecomastia/breast \nenlargement in males\n\nPriapism12\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nAsthenia\nFatigue\nOedema\nPyrexia10\n\nInvestigations\nElevated plasma \nprolactin levels8\n\nIncreased alkaline \nphosphatase10\n\nHigh creatine \nphosphokinase11\n\nHigh Gamma \nGlutamyltransferase10\n\nHigh uric acid10\n\nIncreased total \nbilirubin\n\n1\nClinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) \n\ncategories. Following short term treatment (median duration 47 days), weight gain \u2265 7% of \nbaseline body weight was very common (22.2 %), \u2265 15 % was common (4.2 %) and \u2265 25 % was \nuncommon (0.8 %). Patients gaining \u2265 7 %, \u2265 15 % and \u2265 25 % of their baseline body weight with \nlong-term exposure (at least 48 weeks) were very common (64.4 %, 31.7 % and 12.3 % \nrespectively).\n\n\n\n11\n\n2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were \ngreater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline.\n\n3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 5.17 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 6.2 mmol/l). Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline \n(\u2265 5.17-< 6.2 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 6.2 mmol/l) were very common.\n\n4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 5.56 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 7 mmol/l). Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline (\u2265 5.56-< 7 mmol/l) to high \n(\u2265 7 mmol/l) were very common.\n\n5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.69 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 2.26 mmol/l). Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline \n(\u2265 1.69 mmol/l-< 2.26 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 2.26 mmol/l) were very common.\n\n6 In clinical trials, the incidence of Parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was \nnumerically higher, but not statistically significantly different from placebo. Olanzapine-treated \npatients had a lower incidence of Parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated \ndoses of haloperidol. In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of \nindividual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders, it cannot be concluded at \npresent that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and/or other tardive extrapyramidal \nsyndromes.\n\n7 Acute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea and vomiting have been \nreported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly.\n\n8 In clinical trials of up to 12 weeks, plasma prolactin concentrations exceeded the upper limit of \nnormal range in approximately 30% of olanzapine treated patients with normal baseline prolactin \nvalue. In the majority of these patients the elevations were generally mild, and remained below two \ntimes the upper limit of normal range.\n\n9 Adverse event identified from clinical trials in the Olanzapine Integrated Database.\n\n10 As assessed by measured values from clinical trials in the Olanzapine Integrated Database.\n\n11 Adverse event identified from spontaneous post-marketing reporting with frequency determined \nutilising the Olanzapine Integrated Database.\n\n12 Adverse event identified from spontaneous post-marketing reporting with frequency estimated at \nthe upper limit of the 95% confidence interval utilising the Olanzapine Integrated Database.\n\nLong-term exposure (at least 48 weeks)\nThe proportion of patients who had adverse, clinically significant changes in weight gain, glucose, \ntotal/LDL/HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time. In adult patients who completed \n9-12 months of therapy, the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 6 \nmonths.\n\nAdditional information on special populations\nIn clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia, olanzapine treatment was associated with a \nhigher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo (see section \n4.4). Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group \nwere abnormal gait and falls. Pneumonia, increased body temperature, lethargy, erythema, visual \nhallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly.\n\nIn clinical trials in patients with drug-induced (dopamine agonist) psychosis associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease, worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported \nvery commonly and more frequently than with placebo.\n\n\n\n12\n\nIn one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania, valproate combination therapy with olanzapine \nresulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1%; a potential contributing factor could be high \nplasma valproate levels. Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased \nlevels (\uf0b3 10%) of tremor, dry mouth, increased appetite, and weight gain. Speech disorder was also \nreported commonly. During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex, \nan increase of \uf0b3 7% from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4% of patients during acute \ntreatment (up to 6 weeks). Long-term olanzapine treatment (up to 12 months) for recurrence \nprevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of \uf0b3 7% from baseline \nbody weight in 39.9% of patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nOlanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years. \nAlthough no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted, data \nfrom the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials.\n\nThe following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in \nadolescent patients (aged 13-17 years) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified \nduring short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients. Clinically significant weight gain (\u2265 7%) \nappears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable \nexposures. The magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had \nclinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks) than \nwith short-term exposure.\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. The frequency terms listed are defined as follows: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10).\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nVery common: Weight gain13, elevated triglyceride levels14, increased appetite.\nCommon: Elevated cholesterol levels15\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Sedation (including: hypersomnia, lethargy, somnolence).\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Dry mouth\nHepatobiliary disorders\nVery common: Elevations of hepatic aminotransferases (ALT/AST; see section 4.4).\nInvestigations \nVery common: Decreased total bilirubin, increased GGT, elevated plasma prolactin levels16.\n\n13 Following short term treatment (median duration 22 days), weight gain \u2265 7 % of baseline body \nweight (kg) was very common (40.6 %), \u2265 15 % of baseline body weight was common (7.1 %) and \n\u2265 25 % was common (2.5 %). With long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks), 89.4 % gained \u2265 7 %, \n55.3 % gained \u2265 15 % and 29.1 % gained \u2265 25% of their baseline body weight.\n\n14 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 1.467 mmol/l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline \n(\u2265 1.016 mmol/l-< 1.467 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 1.467 mmol/l).\n\n15 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline (< 4.39 mmol/l) to high \n(\u2265 5.17 mmol/l) were observed commonly. Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from \nborderline at baseline (\u2265 4.39-< 5.17 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 5.17 mmol/l) were very common.\n\n16 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4% of adolescent patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\n\n\n13\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSigns and symptoms\nVery common symptoms in overdose (> 10% incidence) include tachycardia, \nagitation/aggressiveness, dysarthria, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of \nconsciousness ranging from sedation to coma.\n\nOther medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium, convulsion, coma, possible \nneuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depression, aspiration, hypertension or hypotension, \ncardiac arrhythmias (< 2% of overdose cases) and cardiopulmonary arrest. Fatal outcomes have \nbeen reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following \nacute overdose of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine.\n\nManagement\nThere is no specific antidote for olanzapine. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Standard \nprocedures for management of overdose may be indicated (i.e. gastric lavage, administration of \nactivated charcoal). The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the \noral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60%.\n\nSymptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to \nclinical presentation, including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of \nrespiratory function. Do not use epinephrine, dopamine, or other sympathomimetic agents with \nbetaagonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension. Cardiovascular monitoring is \nnecessary to detect possible arrhythmias. Close medical supervision and monitoring should \ncontinue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptics, diazepines, oxazepines, thiazepines and oxepines, ATC \ncode: N05AH03.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nOlanzapine is an antipsychotic, antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad \npharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems.\n\nIn preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki < 100 nM) for \nserotonin 5 HT2A/2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors \nM1-M5; \u03b11 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors. Animal behavioural studies with olanzapine \nindicated 5HT, dopamine, and cholinergic antagonism, consistent with the receptor-binding profile. \nOlanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5 HT2 than dopamine D2\nreceptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo, models. Electrophysiological studies \ndemonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic (A10) dopaminergic \nneurons, while having little effect on the striatal (A9) pathways involved in motor function. \nOlanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response, a test indicative of antipsychotic activity, at \ndoses below those producing catalepsy, an effect indicative of motor side-effects. Unlike some \nother antipsychotic agents, olanzapine increases responding in an \u201canxiolytic\u201d test.\n\nIn a single oral dose (10 mg) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study in healthy volunteers,\nolanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. In addition, a Single\n\n\n\n14\n\nPhoton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging study in schizophrenic patients \nrevealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other \nantipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients, while being comparable to clozapine-responsive \npatients.\n\nClinical efficacy\nIn two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic \npatients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms, olanzapine was associated with \nstatistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms.\n\nIn a multinational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related \ndisorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms \n(baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective \nsecondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically \nsignificant improvement (p=0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1).\n\nIn patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, olanzapine demonstrated superior \nefficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium (divalproex) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 \nweeks. Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the \nproportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks. In a \nco-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks, the \naddition of olanzapine 10 mg (co-therapy with lithium or valproate) resulted in a greater reduction \nin symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks.\n\nIn a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on \nolanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo, olanzapine demonstrated \nstatistically significant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence. \nOlanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing \neither recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression.\n\nIn a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved \nremission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or \nlithium alone, olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of \nbipolar recurrence (olanzapine 30.0%, lithium 38.3%; p=0.055).\n\nIn an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus \na mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate), long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate \nwas not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar \nrecurrence, defined according to syndromic (diagnostic) criteria.\n\nPaediatric population\nControlled efficacy data in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) are limited to short term studies in \nschizophrenia (6 weeks) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder (3 weeks), involving less than \n200 adolescents. Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to \n20 mg/day. During treatment with olanzapine, adolescents gained significantly more weight \ncompared with adults. The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, \ntriglycerides, and prolactin (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) were greater in adolescents than in adults. \nThere are no controlled data on maintenance of effect or long term safety (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\nInformation on long term safety is primarily limited to open-label, uncontrolled data.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nOlanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within \n5 to 8 hours. The absorption is not affected by food. Absolute oral bioavailability relative to \nintravenous administration has not been determined.\n\n\n\n15\n\nDistribution\nThe plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 \nto about 1000 ng/ml. Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and \uf0611-acid-glycoprotein.\n\nBiotransformation\nOlanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways. The major \ncirculating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide, which does not pass the blood brain barrier. \nCytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl \nand 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites, both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological \nactivity than olanzapine in animal studies. The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the \nparent olanzapine.\n\nElimination\nAfter oral administration, the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects \nvaried on the basis of age and gender.\n\nIn healthy elderly (65 and over) versus non-elderly subjects, the mean elimination half-life was \nprolonged (51.8 versus 33.8 hr) and the clearance was reduced (17.5 versus 18.2 l/hr). The \npharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly. In 44 \npatients with schizophrenia 65 years of age, dosing from 5 to 20 mg/day was not associated with \nany distinguishing profile of adverse events.\n\nIn female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged (36.7 versus \n32.3 hr) and the clearance was reduced (18.9 versus 27.3 l/hr). However, olanzapine (5-20 mg) \ndemonstrated a comparable safety profile in female (n=467) as in male patients (n=869).\n\nRenal impairment\nIn renally impaired patients (creatinine clearance < 10 ml/min) versus healthy subjects, there was \nno significant difference in mean elimination half-life (37.7 versus 32.4 hr) or clearance (21.2 \nversus 25.0 l/hr). A mass balance study showed that approximately 57% of radiolabelled \nolanzapine appeared in urine, principally as metabolites.\n\nHepatic impairment \nA small study of the effect of impaired liver function in 6 subjects with clinically significant \n(Childs Pugh Classification A (n = 5) and B (n = 1)) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the \npharmacokinetics of orally administered olanzapine (2.5 \u2013 7.5 mg single dose): Subjects with mild \nto moderate hepatic dysfunction had slightly increased systemic clearance and faster elimination \nhalf-time compared to subjects with no hepatic dysfunction (n = 3). There were more smokers \namong subjects with cirrhosis (4/6; 67 %) than among subjects with no hepatic dysfunction (0/3; \n0 %).\n\nSmoking\nIn non-smoking versus smoking subjects (males and females) the mean elimination half-life was \nprolonged (38.6 versus 30.4 hr) and the clearance was reduced (18.6 versus 27.7 l/hr).\n\nThe plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects, in females versus \nmales, and in non-smokers versus smokers. However, the magnitude of the impact of age, gender, \nor smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability \nbetween individuals.\n\nIn a study of Caucasians, Japanese, and Chinese subjects, there were no differences in the \npharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations.\n\nPaediatric population\nAdolescents (ages 13 to 17 years): The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between \nadolescents and adults. In clinical studies, the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27% \nhigher in adolescents. Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower \n\n\n\n16\n\naverage body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers. Such factors possibly contribute to the \nhigher average exposure observed in adolescents.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAcute (single-dose) toxicity\nSigns of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds: \nhypoactivity, coma, tremors, clonic convulsions, salivation, and depressed weight gain. The \nmedian lethal doses were approximately 210 mg/kg (mice) and 175 mg/kg (rats). Dogs tolerated \nsingle oral doses up to 100 mg/kg without mortality. Clinical signs included sedation, ataxia, \ntremors, increased heart rate, labored respiration, miosis, and anorexia. In monkeys, single oral \ndoses up to 100 mg/kg resulted in prostration and, at higher doses, semi-consciousness.\n\nRepeated-dose toxicity\nIn studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs, the predominant \neffects were CNS depression, anticholinergic effects, and peripheral haematological disorders. \nTolerance developed to the CNS depression. Growth parameters were decreased at high doses. \nReversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries \nand uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland.\n\nHaematologic toxicity:\nEffects on haematology parameters were found in each species, including dose-related reductions \nin circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats; \nhowever, no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found. Reversible neutropenia, \nthrombocytopenia, or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg/kg/day (total \nolanzapine exposure [AUC] is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose). In \ncytopenic dogs, there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone \nmarrow.\n\nReproductive toxicity\nOlanzapine had no teratogenic effects. Sedation affected mating performance of male rats. \nEstrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg/kg (3 times the maximum human dose) and \nreproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg/kg (9 times the maximum human \ndose). In the offspring of rats given olanzapine, delays in foetal development and transient \ndecreases in offspring activity levels were seen.\n\nMutagenicity\nOlanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests, which included \nbacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests.\n\nCarcinogenicity\nBased on the results of studies in mice and rats, it was concluded that olanzapine is not \ncarcinogenic.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nAdults\nOlanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n\nOlanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in \npatients who have shown an initial treatment response.\n\nOlanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode.\n\nIn patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment, olanzapine is indicated for \nthe prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nAdults\nSchizophrenia: The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg/day.\n\nManic episode: The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in \ncombination therapy (see section 5.1).\n\nPreventing recurrence in bipolar disorder: The recommended starting dose is 10 mg/day. For \npatients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode, continue therapy for \npreventing recurrence at the same dose. If a new manic, mixed, or depressive episode occurs, \nolanzapine treatment should be continued (with dose optimisation as needed), with supplementary \ntherapy to treat mood symptoms, as clinically indicated.\n\nDuring treatment for schizophrenia, manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder, \ndaily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the \nrange 5-20 mg/day. An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised \nonly after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than \n24 hours. \nOlanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food. Gradual \ntapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine.\nZalasta orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth, where it will rapidly disperse in saliva, \nso it can be easily swallowed. Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is \ndifficult. Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the \nblister. Alternatively, it may be dispersed in a full glass of water immediately before \nadministration.\n\nOlanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine tablets, with a similar rate and \nextent of absorption. It has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine tablets. \nOlanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine tablets.\n\nSpecial populations\n\n\n\n21\n\nElderly\nA lower starting dose (5 mg/day) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 \nand over when clinical factors warrant (see also section 4.4).\n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment\nA lower starting dose (5 mg) should be considered for such patients. In cases of moderate hepatic \ninsufficiency (cirrhosis, Child-Pugh Class A or B), the starting dose should be 5 mg and only \nincreased with caution.\n\nSmokers\nThe starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers. \nThe metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking. Clinical monitoring is recommended \nand an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.5).\n\nWhen more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism (female gender, \ngeriatric age, non-smoking status), consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose. \nDose escalation, when indicated, should be conservative in such patients.\n\n(See sections 4.5 and 5.2.)\n\nPaediatric population\nOlanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a \nlack of data on safety and efficacy. A greater magnitude of weight gain, lipid and prolactin \nalterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult \npatients (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nPatients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several \ndays to some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored during this period.\n\nDementia-related psychosis and/or behavioural disturbances\nOlanzapine is not recommended for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis and/or \nbehavioural disturbances because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular \naccident. In placebo-controlled clinical trials (6-12 weeks duration) of elderly patients (mean age \n78 years) with dementia-related psychosis and/or disturbed behaviours, there was a 2-fold increase \nin the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo \n(3.5% vs. 1.5%, respectively). The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine \ndose (mean daily dose 4.4 mg) or duration of treatment. Risk factors that may predispose this \npatient population to increased mortality include age > 65 years, dysphagia, sedation, malnutrition \nand dehydration, pulmonary conditions (e.g., pneumonia, with or without aspiration), or \nconcomitant use of benzodiazepines. However, the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-\ntreated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors.\n\nIn the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e.g., stroke, transient ischemic \nattack), including fatalities, were reported. There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated \nwith olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo (1.3% vs. 0.4%, respectively). All \nolanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing \nrisk factors. Age > 75 years and vascular/mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for \nCVAE in association with olanzapine treatment. The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in \nthese trials.\n\n\n\n22\n\nParkinson's disease\nThe use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with \nParkinson's disease is not recommended. In clinical trials, worsening of Parkinsonian \nsymptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with \nplacebo (see section 4.8), and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of \npsychotic symptoms. In these trials, patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest \neffective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products (dopamine agonist) and to remain on the \nsame anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study. Olanzapine was \nstarted at 2.5 mg/day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg/day based on investigator judgement.\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\nNMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal products. \nRare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine. Clinical \nmanifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of \nautonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac \ndysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria \n(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of \nNMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, \nall antipsychotic medicines, including olanzapine must be discontinued.\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes\nHyperglycaemia and/or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with \nketoacidosis or coma has been reported uncommonly, including some fatal cases (see section 4.8). \nIn some cases, a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing \nfactor. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic \nguidelines, e.g. measuring of blood glucose at baseline, 12 weeks after starting olanzapine \ntreatment and annually thereafter. Patients treated with any antipsychotic medicines, including \nZalasta, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, \npolyuria, polyphagia, and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for \ndiabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Weight should be \nmonitored regularly, e.g. at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and \nquarterly thereafter.\n\nLipid alterations\nUndesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials (see section 4.8). Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically \nappropriate, particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the \ndevelopment of lipids disorders. Patients treated with any antipsychotic medicines, including \nZalasta, should be monitored regularly for lipids in accordance with utilised antipsychotic \nguidelines, e.g. at baseline, 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and every 5 years \nthereafter.\n\nAnticholinergic activity\nWhile olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro, experience during the clinical \ntrials revealed a low incidence of related events. However, as clinical experience with olanzapine in \npatients with concomitant illness is limited, caution is advised when prescribing for patients with \nprostatic hypertrophy, or paralytic ileus and related conditions.\n\nHepatic function\nTransient, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic aminotransferases, ALT, AST have been seen \ncommonly, especially in early treatment. Caution should be exercised and follow-up organised in \npatients with elevated ALT and/or AST, in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic \nimpairment, in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional \nreserve, and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines. In cases \nwhere hepatitis (including hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed liver injury) has been diagnosed, \nolanzapine treatment should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n23\n\nNeutropenia\nCaution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/or neutrophil counts for any reason, \nin patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-\ninduced bone marrow depression/toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by \nconcomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic \nconditions or with myeloproliferative disease. Neutropenia has been reported commonly when \nolanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly (see section 4.8).\n\nDiscontinuation of treatment\nAcute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea, or vomiting have been \nreported rarely \u2265 0.01% and < 0.1%) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly.\n\nQT interval\nIn clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] \u2265 500 \nmilliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF< 500 msec) were \nuncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in \nassociated cardiac events compared to placebo. However, caution should be exercised when \nolanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, \nin patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, \nhypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.\n\nThromboembolism\nTemporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has been reported\nuncommonly (\u2265 0.1% and < 1%). A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous \nthromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established. However, since patients \nwith schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all \npossible risk factors of VTE e.g. immobilisation of patients, should be identified and preventive \nmeasures undertaken.\n\nGeneral CNS activity\nGiven the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when it is taken in \ncombination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol. As it exhibits in vitro dopamine \nantagonism, olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists.\n\nSeizures\nOlanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to \nfactors which may lower the seizure threshold. Seizures have been reported to occur uncommonly \nin patients when treated with olanzapine. In most of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors \nfor seizures was reported.\n\nTardive Dyskinesia\nIn comparator studies of one year or less duration, olanzapine was associated with a statistically \nsignificant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia. However the risk of tardive \ndyskinesia increases with long term exposure, and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive \ndyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be \nconsidered.\nThese symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nPostural hypotension\nPostural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials. It is \nrecommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years.\n\nSudden cardiac death\nIn postmarketing reports with olanzapine, the event of sudden cardiac death has been reported in \npatients with olanzapine. In a retrospective observational cohort study, the risk of presumed sudden \ncardiac death in patients treated with olanzapine was approximately twice the risk in patients not \n\n\n\n24\n\nusing antipsychotics. In the study, the risk of olanzapine was comparable to the risk of atypical \nantipsychotics included in a pooled analysis.\n\nPaediatric population\nOlanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents. Studies in patients \naged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions, including weight gain, changes in metabolic \nparameters and increases in prolactin levels (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nAspartame\nAspartame is a source of phenylalanine. It may be harmful for patient with phenylketonuria (PKU).\nThis medicine should be used with caution in patients with phenylketonuria.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nPotential interactions affecting olanzapine\nSince olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2, substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this \nisoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.\n\nInduction of CYP1A2\nThe metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine, which may lead to \nreduced olanzapine concentrations. Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has \nbeen observed. The clinical consequences are likely to be limited, but clinical monitoring is \nrecommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nInhibition of CYP1A2\nFluvoxamine, a specific CYP 1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism \nof olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54% in female \nnon-smokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52% and 108% \nrespectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using \nfluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as ciprofloxacin. A decrease in the dose of \nolanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP 1A2 is initiated.\n\nDecreased bioavailability\nActivated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60% and should be taken \nat least 2 hours before or after olanzapine.\n\nFluoxetine (a CYP2D6 inhibitor), single doses of antacid (aluminium, magnesium) or cimetidine \nhave not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.\n\nPotential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products\nOlanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists.\n\nOlanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro (e.g. 1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, \n3A4). Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no \ninhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant \n(representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or \ndiazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).\n\nOlanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden.\n\nTherapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage \nadjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine.\n\n\n\n25\n\nGeneral CNS activity\nCaution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that \ncan cause central nervous system depression.\n\nThe concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with \nParkinson's disease and dementia is not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nQTc interval\nCaution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products \nknown to increase QTc interval (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Patients should be advised \nto notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment \nwith olanzapine. Nevertheless, because human experience is limited, olanzapine should be used in \npregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nNew born infants exposed to antipsychotics (including olanzapine) during the third trimester of \npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms \nthat may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, \nhypertonia, hypotonis, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, \nnewborns should be monitored carefully.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIn a study in breast-feeding, healthy women, olanzapine was excreted in breast milk. Mean infant \nexposure (mg/kg) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8% of the maternal olanzapine dose \n(mg/kg). Patients should be advised not to breast feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine.\n\nFertility\nEffects on fertility are unknown (see section 5.3 for preclinical information).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\nBecause olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness, patients should be cautioned about \noperating machinery, including motor vehicles.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nAdults\nThe most frequently (seen in \u2265 1% of patients) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of \nolanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, \ncholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, \ndizziness, akathisia, parkinsonism, leukopenia, neutropenia (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic \nhypotension, anticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic \naminotransferases (see section 4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue, pyrexia, arthralgia, increased alkaline \nphosphatase, high gamma glutamyltransferase, high uric acid, high creatine phosphokinase and \noedema.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following table lists the adverse reactions  and laboratory investigations observed from \nspontaneous reporting and in clinical trials.

The frequency terms listed are defined as follows: Very \n\n\n\n26\n\ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the data available).\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Not known\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders\n\nEosinophilia\nLeukopenia10\n\nNeutropenia10\n\nThrombocytopenia1\n1\n\nImmune system disorders\nHypersensitivity11\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nWeight gain1 Elevated cholesterol \n\nlevels2,3\n\nElevated glucose \nlevels4\n\nElevated triglyceride \nlevels2,5\n\nGlucosuria\nIncreased appetite\n\nDevelopment or \nexacerbation of \ndiabetes occasionally \nassociated with \nketoacidosis or coma, \nincluding some fatal \ncases (see section \n4.4)11\n\nHypothermia12\n\nNervous system disorders\nSomnolence Dizziness\n\nAkathisia6\n\nParkinsonism6\n\nDyskinesia6\n\nSeizures where in most \ncases a history of \nseizures or risk factors \nfor seizures were \nreported11\n\nDystonia (including \noculogyration)11\n\nTardive dyskinesia11\n\nAmnesia9\n\nDysarthria\nStuttering11\n\nRestless legs \nsyndrome11\n\nNeuroleptic \nmalignant \nsyndrome (see \nsection 4.4)12\n\nDiscontinuation \nsymptoms7, 12\n\nCardiac disorders\nBradycardia\nQTc prolongation (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nVentricular \ntachycardia/fibrillat\nion, sudden death \n(see section 4.4)11\n\nVascular disorders\nOrthostatic \nhypotension10\n\nThromboembolism \n(including pulmonary \nembolism and deep \nvein thrombosis) (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nEpistaxis9\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nMild, transient \nanticholinergic effects \nincluding constipation \nand dry mouth\n\nAbdominal distension9\n\nSalivary \nhypersecretion11\n\nPancreatitis11\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nTransient, \nasymptomatic \nelevations of hepatic \naminotransferases \n\nHepatitis (including \nhepatocellular,\ncholestatic or \nmixed liver \n\n\n\n27\n\n(ALT, AST), \nespecially in early \ntreatment (see section \n4.4)\n\ninjury)11\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nRash Photosensitivity \n\nreaction\nAlopecia\n\nDrug Reaction \nwith Eosinophilia \nand Systemic \nSymptoms \n(DRESS)\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nArthralgia9 Rhabdomyolysis11\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nUrinary incontinence, \nurinary retention\nUrinary hesitation11\n\nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions\nDrug withdrawal \nsyndrome neonatal \n(see section 4.6)\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nErectile dysfunction in \nmales\nDecreased libido in \nmales and females\n\nAmenorrhea\nBreast enlargement\nGalactorrhea in \nfemales \nGynaecomastia/breast \nenlargement in males\n\nPriapism12\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nAsthenia\nFatigue\nOedema\nPyrexia10\n\nInvestigations\nElevated plasma \nprolactin levels8\n\nIncreased alkaline \nphosphatase10\n\nHigh creatine \nphosphokinase11\n\nHigh Gamma \nGlutamyltransferase10\n\nHigh uric acid10\n\nIncreased total \nbilirubin\n\n1\nClinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) \n\ncategories. Following short term treatment (median duration 47 days), weight gain \u2265 7% of \nbaseline body weight was very common (22.2 %), \u2265 15 % was common (4.2 %) and \u2265 25 % was \nuncommon (0.8 %). Patients gaining \u2265 7 %, \u2265 15 % and \u2265 25 % of their baseline body weight with \nlong-term exposure (at least 48 weeks) were very common (64.4 %, 31.7 % and 12.3 % \nrespectively).\n\n2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were \ngreater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline.\n\n3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 5.17 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 6.2 mmol/l). Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline \n(\u2265 5.17-< 6.2 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 6.2 mmol/l) were very common.\n\n\n\n28\n\n4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 5.56 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 7 mmol/l). Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline (\u2265 5.56-< 7 mmol/l) to high \n(\u2265 7 mmol/l) were very common.\n\n5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.69 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 2.26 mmol/l). Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline \n(\u2265 1.69 mmol/l-< 2.26 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 2.26 mmol/l) were very common.\n\n6 In clinical trials, the incidence of Parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was \nnumerically higher, but not statistically significantly different from placebo. Olanzapine-treated \npatients had a lower incidence of Parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated \ndoses of haloperidol. In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of \nindividual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders, it cannot be concluded at \npresent that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and/or other tardive extrapyramidal \nsyndromes.\n\n7 Acute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea and vomiting have been \nreported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly.\n\n8 In clinical trials of up to 12 weeks, plasma prolactin concentrations exceeded the upper limit of \nnormal range in approximately 30% of olanzapine treated patients with normal baseline prolactin \nvalue. In the majority of these patients the elevations were generally mild, and remained below two \ntimes the upper limit of normal range.\n\n9 Adverse event identified from clinical trials in the Olanzapine Integrated Database.\n\n10 As assessed by measured values from clinical trials in the Olanzapine Integrated Database.\n\n11 Adverse event identified from spontaneous post-marketing reporting with frequency determined \nutilising the Olanzapine Integrated Database.\n\n12 Adverse event identified from spontaneous post-marketing reporting with frequency estimated at \nthe upper limit of the 95% confidence interval utilising the Olanzapine Integrated Database.\n\nLong-term exposure (at least 48 weeks)\nThe proportion of patients who had adverse, clinically significant changes in weight gain, glucose, \ntotal/LDL/HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time. In adult patients who completed \n9-12 months of therapy, the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 6 \nmonths.\n\nAdditional information on special populations\nIn clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia, olanzapine treatment was associated with a \nhigher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo (see section \n4.4). Very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group \nwere abnormal gait and falls. Pneumonia, increased body temperature, lethargy, erythema, visual \nhallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly.\n\nIn clinical trials in patients with drug-induced (dopamine agonist) psychosis associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease, worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported \nvery commonly and more frequently than with placebo.\n\nIn one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania, valproate combination therapy with olanzapine \nresulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1%; a potential contributing factor could be high \nplasma valproate levels. Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased \nlevels (\uf0b3 10%) of tremor, dry mouth, increased appetite, and weight gain. Speech disorder was also \nreported commonly. During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex, \nan increase of \uf0b3 7% from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4% of patients during acute \n\n\n\n29\n\ntreatment (up to 6 weeks). Long-term olanzapine treatment (up to 12 months) for recurrence \nprevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of \uf0b3 7% from baseline \nbody weight in 39.9% of patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nOlanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years. \nAlthough no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted, data \nfrom the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials.\n\nThe following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in \nadolescent patients (aged 13-17 years) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified \nduring short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients. Clinically significant weight gain (\u2265 7%) \nappears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable \nexposures. The magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had \nclinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks) than \nwith short-term exposure.\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. The frequency terms listed are defined as follows: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10).\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nVery common: Weight gain13, elevated triglyceride levels14, increased appetite.\nCommon: Elevated cholesterol levels15\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Sedation (including: hypersomnia, lethargy, somnolence).\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Dry mouth\nHepatobiliary disorders\nVery common: Elevations of hepatic aminotransferases (ALT/AST; see section 4.4).\nInvestigations \nVery common: Decreased total bilirubin, increased GGT, elevated plasma prolactin levels16.\n\n13 Following short term treatment (median duration 22 days), weight gain \u2265 7 % of baseline body \nweight (kg) was very common (40.6 %), \u2265 15 % of baseline body weight was common (7.1 %) and \n\u2265 25 % was common (2.5 %). With long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks), 89.4 % gained \u2265 7 %, \n55.3 % gained \u2265 15 % and 29.1 % gained \u2265 25% of their baseline body weight.\n\n14 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 1.467 mmol/l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline \n(\u2265 1.016 mmol/l-< 1.467 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 1.467 mmol/l).\n\n15 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline (< 4.39 mmol/l) to high \n(\u2265 5.17 mmol/l) were observed commonly. Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from \nborderline at baseline (\u2265 4.39-< 5.17 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 5.17 mmol/l) were very common.\n\n16 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4% of adolescent patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\n\n\n30\n\nVery common symptoms in overdose (> 10% incidence) include tachycardia, \nagitation/aggressiveness, dysarthria, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of \nconsciousness ranging from sedation to coma.\n\nOther medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium, convulsion, coma, possible \nneuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depression, aspiration, hypertension or hypotension, \ncardiac arrhythmias (< 2% of overdose cases) and cardiopulmonary arrest. Fatal outcomes have \nbeen reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following \nacute overdose of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine.\n\nManagement\nThere is no specific antidote for olanzapine. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Standard \nprocedures for management of overdose may be indicated (i.e. gastric lavage, administration of \nactivated charcoal). The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the \noral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60%.\n\nSymptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to \nclinical presentation, including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of \nrespiratory function. Do not use epinephrine, dopamine, or other sympathomimetic agents with \nbetaagonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension. Cardiovascular monitoring is \nnecessary to detect possible arrhythmias. Close medical supervision and monitoring should \ncontinue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptics, diazepines, oxazepines, thiazepines and oxepines, ATC \ncode: N05AH03.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nOlanzapine is an antipsychotic, antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad \npharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems.\n\nIn preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki < 100 nM) for \nserotonin 5 HT2A/2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors \nM1-M5; \u03b11 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors. Animal behavioural studies with olanzapine \nindicated 5HT, dopamine, and cholinergic antagonism, consistent with the receptor-binding profile. \nOlanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5 HT2 than dopamine D2\nreceptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo, models. Electrophysiological studies \ndemonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic (A10) dopaminergic \nneurons, while having little effect on the striatal (A9) pathways involved in motor function. \nOlanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response, a test indicative of antipsychotic activity, at \ndoses below those producing catalepsy, an effect indicative of motor side-effects. Unlike some \nother antipsychotic agents, olanzapine increases responding in an \u201canxiolytic\u201d test.\n\nIn a single oral dose (10 mg) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study in healthy volunteers, \nolanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. In addition, a Single\nPhoton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging study in schizophrenic patients \nrevealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other \nantipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients, while being comparable to clozapine-responsive \npatients.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\n\n\n31\n\nIn two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic \npatients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms, olanzapine was associated with \nstatistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms.\n\nIn a multinational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related \ndisorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms \n(baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective \nsecondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically \nsignificant improvement (p=0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1).\n\nIn patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, olanzapine demonstrated superior \nefficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium (divalproex) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 \nweeks. Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the \nproportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks. In a \nco-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks, the \naddition of olanzapine 10 mg (co-therapy with lithium or valproate) resulted in a greater reduction \nin symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks.\n\nIn a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on \nolanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo, olanzapine demonstrated \nstatistically significant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence. \nOlanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing \neither recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression.\n\nIn a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved \nremission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or \nlithium alone, olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of \nbipolar recurrence (olanzapine 30.0%, lithium 38.3%; p=0.055).\n\nIn an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus \na mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate), long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate \nwas not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar \nrecurrence, defined according to syndromic (diagnostic) criteria.\n\nPaediatric population\nControlled efficacy data in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) are limited to short term studies in \nschizophrenia (6 weeks) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder (3 weeks), involving less than \n200 adolescents. Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to \n20 mg/day. During treatment with olanzapine, adolescents gained significantly more weight \ncompared with adults. The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, \ntriglycerides, and prolactin (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) were greater in adolescents than in adults.  \nThere are no controlled data on maintenance of effect or long term safety (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\nInformation on long term safety is primarily limited to open-label, uncontrolled data.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nOlanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine tablets, with a similar rate and \nextent of absorption. Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine \ntablets.\n\nAbsorption\nOlanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within \n5 to 8 hours. The absorption is not affected by food. Absolute oral bioavailability relative to \nintravenous administration has not been determined.\n\nDistribution\n\n\n\n32\n\nThe plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 \nto about 1000 ng/ml. Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and \uf0611-acid-glycoprotein.\n\nBiotransformation\nOlanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways. The major \ncirculating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide, which does not pass the blood brain barrier. \nCytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl \nand 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites, both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological \nactivity than olanzapine in animal studies. The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the \nparent olanzapine.\n\nElimination\nAfter oral administration, the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects \nvaried on the basis of age and gender.\n\nIn healthy elderly (65 and over) versus non-elderly subjects, the mean elimination half-life was \nprolonged (51.8 versus 33.8 hr) and the clearance was reduced (17.5 versus 18.2 l/hr). The \npharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly. In 44 \npatients with schizophrenia 65 years of age, dosing from 5 to 20 mg/day was not associated with \nany distinguishing profile of adverse events.\n\nIn female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged (36.7 versus \n32.3 hr) and the clearance was reduced (18.9 versus 27.3 l/hr). However, olanzapine (5-20 mg) \ndemonstrated a comparable safety profile in female (n=467) as in male patients (n=869).\n\nRenal impairment\nIn renally impaired patients (creatinine clearance < 10 ml/min) versus healthy subjects, there was \nno significant difference in mean elimination half-life (37.7 versus 32.4 hr) or clearance (21.2 \nversus 25.0 l/hr). A mass balance study showed that approximately 57% of radiolabelled \nolanzapine appeared in urine, principally as metabolites.\n\nHepatic impairment \nA small study of the effect of impaired liver function in 6 subjects with clinically significant \n(Childs Pugh Classification A (n = 5) and B (n = 1)) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the \npharmacokinetics of orally administered olanzapine (2.5 \u2013 7.5 mg single dose): Subjects with mild \nto moderate hepatic dysfunction had slightly increased systemic clearance and faster elimination \nhalf-time compared to subjects with no hepatic dysfunction (n = 3). There were more smokers \namong subjects with cirrhosis (4/6; 67 %) than among subjects with no hepatic dysfunction (0/3; \n0 %).\n\nSmoking\nIn non-smoking versus smoking subjects (males and females) the mean elimination half-life was \nprolonged (38.6 versus 30.4 hr) and the clearance was reduced (18.6 versus 27.7 l/hr).\n\nThe plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects, in females versus \nmales, and in non-smokers versus smokers. However, the magnitude of the impact of age, gender, \nor smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability \nbetween individuals.\n\nIn a study of Caucasians, Japanese, and Chinese subjects, there were no differences in the \npharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations.\n\nPaediatric population\nAdolescents (ages 13 to 17 years): The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between \nadolescents and adults. In clinical studies, the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27% \nhigher in adolescents. Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower \n\n\n\n33\n\naverage body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers. Such factors possibly contribute to the \nhigher average exposure observed in adolescents.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAcute (single-dose) toxicity\nSigns of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds: \nhypoactivity, coma, tremors, clonic convulsions, salivation, and depressed weight gain. The \nmedian lethal doses were approximately 210 mg/kg (mice) and 175 mg/kg (rats). Dogs tolerated \nsingle oral doses up to 100 mg/kg without mortality. Clinical signs included sedation, ataxia, \ntremors, increased heart rate, labored respiration, miosis, and anorexia. In monkeys, single oral \ndoses up to 100 mg/kg resulted in prostration and, at higher doses, semi-consciousness.\n\nRepeated-dose toxicity\nIn studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs, the predominant \neffects were CNS depression, anticholinergic effects, and peripheral haematological disorders. \nTolerance developed to the CNS depression. Growth parameters were decreased at high doses. \nReversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries \nand uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland.\n\nHaematologic toxicity:\nEffects on haematology parameters were found in each species, including dose-related reductions \nin circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats; \nhowever, no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found. Reversible neutropenia, \nthrombocytopenia, or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg/kg/day (total \nolanzapine exposure [AUC] is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 12-mg dose). In \ncytopenic dogs, there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone \nmarrow.\n\nReproductive toxicity\nOlanzapine had no teratogenic effects. Sedation affected mating performance of male rats. \nEstrous cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg/kg (3 times the maximum human dose) and \nreproduction parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg/kg (9 times the maximum human \ndose). In the offspring of rats given olanzapine, delays in foetal development and transient \ndecreases in offspring activity levels were seen.\n\nMutagenicity\nOlanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests, which included \nbacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests.\n\nCarcinogenicity\nBased on the results of studies in mice and rats, it was concluded that olanzapine is not \ncarcinogenic.\n\n6.

"like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. tell your doctor immediately if you have: unusual movement (a common side effect that may affect up to 1 in 10 people) mainly of the face or tongue; blood clots in the veins (an uncommon side effect that may affect up to 1 in 100 people) especially in the legs (symptoms include swelling, pain, and redness in the leg), which may 82 travel through blood vessels to the lungs causing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. if you notice any of these symptoms seek medical advice immediately; a combination of fever, faster breathing, sweating, muscle stiffness and drowsiness or sleepiness (the frequency of this side effect cannot be estimated from the available data). very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) include weight gain; sleepiness and increases in levels of prolactin in the blood. in the early stages of treatment, some people may feel dizzy or faint (with a slow heart rate), especially when getting up from a lying or sitting position. this will usually pass on its own but if it does not, tell your doctor. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) include changes in the levels of some blood cells, circulating fats and early in treatment, temporary increases in liver enzymes; increases in the level of sugars in the blood and urine; increases in levels of uric acid and creatine phosphokinase in the blood; feeling more hungry; dizziness; restlessness; tremor; unusual movements (dyskinesias); constipation; dry mouth; rash; loss of strength; extreme tiredness; water retention leading to swelling of the hands, ankles or feet; fever; joint pain; and sexual dysfunctions such as decreased libido in males and females or erectile dysfunction in males. uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) include hypersensitivity (e.g. swelling in the mouth and throat, itching, rash); diabetes or the worsening of diabetes, occasionally associated with ketoacidosis (ketones in the blood and urine) or coma; seizures, usually associated with a history of seizures (epilepsy); muscle stiffness or spasms (including eye movements); restless legs syndrome; problems with speech; stuttering; slow heart rate; sensitivity to sunlight; bleeding from the nose; abdominal distension; drooling; memory loss or forgetfulness; urinary incontinence; lack of ability to urinate; hair loss; absence or decrease in menstrual periods; and changes in breasts in males and females such as an abnormal production of breast milk or abnormal growth. rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) include lowering of normal body temperature; abnormal rhythms of the heart; sudden unexplained death; inflammation of the pancreas causing severe stomach pain, fever and sickness; liver disease appearing as yellowing of the skin and white parts of the eyes; muscle disease presenting as unexplained aches and pains; and prolonged and/or painful erection. very rare side effects include serious allergic reactions such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (dress). dress appears initially as flu-like symptoms with a rash on the face and then with an extended rash, high temperature, enlarged lymph nodes, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type of white blood cell (eosinophilia). while taking olanzapine, elderly patients with dementia may suffer from stroke, pneumonia, urinary incontinence, falls, extreme tiredness, visual hallucinations, a rise in body temperature, redness of the skin and have trouble walking. some fatal cases have been reported in this particular group of patients. in patients with parkinson's disease zalasta may worsen the symptoms. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects
