NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nConstella 290 micrograms hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach capsule contains 290 micrograms of linaclotide. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule. \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white-orange opaque capsule (18 mm x 6.35 mm) marked \u201c290\u201d with grey ink. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nConstella is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome with \n\nconstipation (IBS-C) in adults. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one capsule (290 micrograms) once daily.  \n\nPhysicians should periodically assess the need for continued treatment. The efficacy of linaclotide has been \n\nestablished in double-blind placebo-controlled studies for up to 6 months. If patients have not experienced \n\nimprovement in their symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient should be re-examined and the benefit \n\nand risks of continuing treatment reconsidered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are required for patients with hepatic or renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nFor elderly patients, although no dose adjustment is required, the treatment should be carefully monitored \n\nand periodically re-assessed (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Constella in children aged 0 to18 years have not yet been established. No data are \n\navailable.  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. The capsule should be taken at least 30 minutes before a meal (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to linaclotide or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPatients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nConstella should be used after organic diseases have been ruled out and a diagnosis of moderate to severe \n\nIBS-C (see section 5.1) is established. \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of the possible occurrence of diarrhoea and lower gastrointestinal bleeding during \n\ntreatment. They should be instructed to inform their physician if severe or prolonged diarrhoea or lower \n\ngastrointestinal bleeding occurs (see section 4.8). \n\nShould prolonged (e.g. more than 1 week) or severe diarrhoea occur, medical advice should be sought and \n\ntemporary discontinuation of linaclotide until diarrhoea episode is resolved may be considered. Additional \n\ncaution should be exercised in patients who are prone to a disturbance of water or electrolyte balance (e.g. \n\nelderly, patients with cardiovascular (CV) diseases, diabetes, hypertension), and electrolyte control should be \n\nconsidered.  \n\n \n\nLinaclotide has not been studied in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such \n\nas Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis; therefore it is not recommended to use Constella in these patients. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nThere are limited data in elderly patients (see section 5.1). Because of the higher risk of diarrhoea seen in the \n\nclinical trials (see section 4.8), special attention should be given to these patients and the treatment benefit-\n\nrisk ratio should be carefully and periodically assessed. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nConstella should not be used in children and adolescents as it has not been studied in this population. As \n\nGC-C receptor is known to be overexpressed at early ages, children younger than 2 years may be particularly \n\nsensitive to linaclotide effects. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. Linaclotide is rarely detectable in plasma following \n\nadministration of the recommended clinical doses and in vitro studies have shown that linaclotide is neither a \n\nsubstrate nor an inhibitor/inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and does not interact with a series \n\nof common efflux and uptake transporters (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nA food interaction clinical study in healthy subjects showed that linaclotide was not detectable in plasma \n\neither in fed or in fasted conditions at the therapeutic doses. Taking Constella in the fed condition produced \n\nmore frequent and looser stools, as well as more gastrointestinal adverse events, than when taking it under \n\nfasting conditions (see section 5.1). The capsule should be taken 30 minutes before a meal (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with proton pump inhibitors, laxatives or NSAIDs may increase the risk of diarrhoea. \n\nCaution should be used when co-administering Constella with such medications. \n\n \n\nIn cases of severe or prolonged diarrhoea, absorption of other oral medicinal products may be affected. The \n\nefficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an additional contraceptive method is \n\nrecommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception (see the prescribing information of the oral \n\ncontraceptive). Caution should be exercised when prescribing medicinal products absorbed in the intestinal \n\ntract with a narrow therapeutic index such as levothyroxine as their efficacy may be reduced. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere is limited amount of data from the use of linaclotide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \n\nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a \n\nprecautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Constella during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nLactation \n\nIt is unknown whether linaclotide is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \n\nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \n\nConstella therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for \n\nthe woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nAnimal studies indicate that there is no effect on male or female fertility.  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nConstella has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nLinaclotide has been given orally to 1,166 patients with IBS-C in controlled clinical studies. Of these \n\npatients, 892 patients received linaclotide at the recommended dose of 290 micrograms per day. Total \n\nexposure in the clinical development plan exceeded 1,500 patient-years. The most frequently reported \n\nadverse reaction associated with Constella therapy was diarrhoea, mainly mild to moderate in intensity, \n\noccurring in less than 20% of patients. In rare and more severe cases, this may \u2013 as a consequence \u2013 lead to \n\nthe occurrence of dehydration, hypokalaemia, blood bicarbonate decrease, dizziness, and orthostatic \n\nhypotension. \n\n \n\nOther common adverse reactions (>1%) were abdominal pain, abdominal distension and flatulence.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following adverse reactions were reported in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose of \n\n290 micrograms per day with frequencies corresponding to: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < \n\n1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000) and not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nMedDRA  \n\nsystem organ class \n\nVery \n\ncommon \nCommon Uncommon Rare Unknown \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations  \n \n\nGastroenteritis \n\nviral \n  \n\n \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n  \n\nHypokalaemia \n\nDehydration \n\nDecreased appetite \n\n \n\n \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n Dizziness   \n\n \n\nVascular disorders   Orthostatic hypotension   \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \nDiarrhoea \n\nAbdominal \n\npain \n\nFlatulence  \n\nAbdominal \n\ndistension \n\n \n\nFaecal incontinence \n\nDefecation urgency \n\nLower gastrointestinal \n\nhaemorrhage including \n\nhaemorrhoidal haemorrhage \n\nand rectal haemorrhage \n\nNausea \n\nVomiting \n\n \n\n \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  \n\nUrticaria \n\n \n\nRash \n\nInvestigations    \n\nBlood \n\nbicarbonate \n\ndecreased \n\n \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nDiarrhoea is the most common adverse reaction and is consistent with the pharmacological action of the \n\nactive substance. 2% of treated patients experienced severe diarrhoea and 5% of patients discontinued \n\ntreatment due to diarrhoea in clinical studies. \n\nThe majority of reported cases of diarrhoea were mild (43%) to moderate (47%); 2% of treated patients \n\nexperienced severe diarrhoea. Approximately half of the diarrhoea episodes started within the first week of \n\ntreatment. \n\nThe diarrhoea resolved within seven days in about one third of patients, however 80 patients (50%) \n\nexperienced diarrhoea with a duration of more than 28 days (representing 9.9% of all patients treated with \n\nlinaclotide). \n\nFive percent of patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhoea in clinical studies. In those patients in whom \n\ndiarrhoea led to discontinuation, it resolved after a few days of discontinuing treatment.  \n\n \n\nElderly (>65 years), hypertensive and diabetic patients reported diarrhoea more frequently as compared to \n\nthe overall IBS-C population included in the clinical trials. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nAn overdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of the known pharmacodynamic effects \n\nof the medicinal product, mainly diarrhoea. In a study in healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of \n\n2,897 micrograms (up to 10-fold the recommended therapeutic dose) the safety profile in these subjects was \n\nconsistent with that in the overall population, with diarrhoea being the most commonly reported adverse \n\nevent.  \n\n \n\nShould an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted \n\nas required. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for constipation, other drugs for constipation, ATC Code: A06AX04 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nLinaclotide is a Guanylate Cyclase-C receptor agonist (GCCA) with visceral analgesic and secretory \n\nactivities. \n\n \n\nLinaclotide is a 14-amino acid synthetic peptide structurally related to the endogenous guanylin peptide \n\nfamily. Both linaclotide and its active metabolite bind to the GC-C receptor, on the luminal surface of the \n\nintestinal epithelium. Through its action at GC-C, linaclotide has been shown to reduce visceral pain and \n\nincrease GI transit in animal models and increase colonic transit in humans. Activation of GC-C results in an \n\nincrease in concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), both extracellularly and \n\nintracellularly. Extracellular cGMP decreases pain-fiber activity, resulting in reduced visceral pain in animal \n\nmodels. Intracellular cGMP causes secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen, through \n\nactivation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which results in increased \n\nintestinal fluid and accelerated transit. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nIn a cross-over food interaction study, 18 healthy subjects were administered Constella 290 micrograms for 7 \n\ndays both in the fasting and fed state. Taking Constella immediately after a high fat breakfast resulted in \n\nmore frequent and looser stools, as well as more gastrointestinal adverse events, compared with taking it in \n\nthe fasted state. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\nThe efficacy of linaclotide was established in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 \n\nclinical studies in patients with IBS-C. In one clinical study (study 1), 804 patients were treated with \n\nConstella 290 micrograms or placebo once daily for 26 weeks. In the second clinical study (study 2), 800 \n\npatients were treated for 12 weeks, and then re-randomised for an additional 4 weeks treatment period. \n\nDuring the 2-weeks pre-treatment baseline period, patients had a mean abdominal pain score of 5.6 (0-10 \n\nscale) with 2.2% of abdominal pain-free days, a mean bloating score of 6.6 (0-10 scale), and an average of \n\n1.8 spontaneous bowel movements (SBM)/week. \n\n \n\nThe characteristics of the patient population included in Phase 3 clinical trials were as follows: mean age of \n\n43.9 years [range 18 - 87 years with 5.3% \u2265 65 years of age], 90.1% female. All patients met Rome II criteria \n\nfor IBS-C and were required to report a mean abdominal pain score of \u2265 3 on a 0-to-10-point numeric rating \n\nscale (criteria that correspond to a moderate to severe IBS population), < 3 complete spontaneous bowel \n\nmovements and \u2264 5 SBMs per week during a 2-week baseline period. \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints in both clinical studies were 12-week IBS degree of relief responder rate and \n\n12 week abdominal pain/discomfort responder rate. An IBS degree of relief responder was a patient that was \n\nconsiderably or completely relieved for at least 50% of the treatment period; an abdominal pain/discomfort \n\nresponder was a patient that had an improvement of 30% or more for at least 50% of the treatment period. \n\n \n\nFor the 12 weeks data, study 1 shows that 39% of the patients treated with linaclotide compared with 17% of \n\nthe patients treated with placebo showed response to IBS degree of relief (p<0.0001) and 54% of the patients \n\ntreated with linaclotide compared with 39% of the patients treated with placebo showed response to \n\nabdominal pain/discomfort (p<0.0001). Study 2 shows that 37% of the patients treated with linaclotide \n\ncompared with 19% of the patients treated with placebo showed response to IBS degree of relief (p<0.0001) \n\nand 55% of the patients treated with linaclotide compared with 42% of the patients treated with placebo \n\nshowed response to abdominal pain/discomfort (p=0.0002).   \n\n \n\nFor the 26 weeks data, study 1 shows that 37% and 54% of the patients treated with linaclotide compared \n\nwith 17% and 36% of the patients treated with placebo showed response to IBS degree of relief (p<0.0001) \n\nand abdominal pain/discomfort (p<0.0001) respectively.  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nIn both studies, these improvements were seen by week 1 and sustained over the entire treatment periods \n\n(Figures 1 and 2). Linaclotide has been shown not to cause rebound effect when the treatment was stopped \n\nafter 3 months continuous treatment. \n\n \n\n \nOther signs and symptoms of IBS-C including bloating, complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) \n\nfrequency, straining, stool consistency, were improved in linaclotide treated patients vs. placebo (p<0.0001) \n\nas shown in the following table. These effects were reached at 1 week and sustained over the entire treatment \n\nperiods. \n\n \n\nEffect of linaclotide on IBS-C symptoms during the first 12 weeks of treatment in the pooled phase 3 \n\nefficacy clinical studies (studies 1 and 2). \n\n \n\nMain secondary efficacy \n\nparameters \n\n  \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N =797) \n\nLinaclotide \n\n(N =805)  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nBaseline  \n\nMean \n\n12-\n\nweeks \n\nMean \n\nChange \n\nfrom \n\nbaseline  \n\nMean \n\nBaseline \n\nMean \n\n12-\n\nweeks \n\nMean \n\nChange \n\nfrom \n\nbaseline  \n\nMean \n\nLS mean \n\ndifference \n\nBloating  \n\n(11-point NRS) \n6.5 5.4 \u20131.0  6.7 4.6 \u20131.9 \u20130.9* \n\nCSBM/week 0.2 1.0  0.7  0.2 2.5  2.2  1.6* \n\nStool consistency  \n\n(BSFS Score) \n2.3 3.0  0.6 2.3 4.4  2.0  1.4* \n\nStraining  \n\n(5-point ordinal scale) \n3.5 2.8 \u2013 0.6 3.6 2.2 \u20131.3 \u20130.6* \n\n*p<0.0001, linaclotide vs placebo.

When \n\n2,897 micrograms was administered on day 8, following a 7-day course of 290 micrograms/day, linaclotide \n\nwas detectable in only 2 of 18 subjects at concentrations just above the lower limit of quantification of \n\n0.2 ng/ml (concentrations ranged from 0.212 to 0.735 ng/ml). In the two pivotal phase 3 studies in which \n\npatients were dosed with 290 micrograms of linaclotide once daily, linaclotide was only detected in 2 out of \n\n162 patients approximately 2 h following the initial linaclotide dose (concentrations were 0.241 ng/ml to \n\n0.239 ng/ml) and in none of the 162 patients after 4 weeks of treatment. The active metabolite was not \n\ndetected in any of the 162 patients at any time point. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nAs linaclotide is rarely detectable in plasma following therapeutic doses, standard distribution studies have \n\nnot been conducted. It is expected that linaclotide is negligibly or not systemically distributed.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nLinaclotide is metabolised locally within the gastrointestinal tract to its active primary metabolite, des-\n\ntyrosine. Both linaclotide and des-tyrosine active metabolite are reduced and enzymatically proteolyzed \n\nwithin the gastrointestinal tract to smaller peptides and naturally occurring amino acids. \n\nThe potential inhibitory activity of linaclotide and its active primary metabolite MM-419447 on the human \n\nefflux transporters BCRP, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4 and the human uptake transporters OATP1B1, \n\nOATP1B3, OATP2B1, PEPT1 and OCTN1 was investigated in vitro. Results of this study showed that \n\nneither peptide is an inhibitor of the common efflux and uptake transporters studied at clinically relevant \n\nconcentrations. \n\n \n\nThe effect of linaclotide and its metabolites to inhibit the common intestinal enzymes (CYP2C9 and \n\nCYP3A4) and liver enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) or to induce liver \n\nenzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4/5) was investigated in vitro. Results of these studies showed that \n\nlinaclotide and des-tyrosine metabolite are not inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nFollowing a single oral dose of 2,897 micrograms linaclotide on day 8, after a 7-day course of \n\n290 micrograms/day in 18 healthy volunteers, approximately 3 to 5% of the dose was recovered in the \n\nfaeces, virtually all of it as the des-tyrosine active metabolite. \n\n \n\nAge and gender \n\nClinical studies to determine the impact of age and gender on the clinical pharmacokinetics of linaclotide \n\nhave not been conducted because it is rarely detectable in plasma. Gender is not expected to have any impact \n\non dosing. For age related information, please see sections 4.2., 4.4., and 4.8. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nConstella has not been studied in patients who have renal impairment. Linaclotide is rarely detectable in \n\nplasma, therefore, renal impairment would not be expected to affect clearance of the parent compound or its \n\nmetabolite. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nConstella has not been studied in patients who have hepatic impairment. Linaclotide is rarely detectable in \n\nplasma and is not metabolised by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, therefore, hepatic impairment would not \n\nbe expected to affect the metabolism or clearance of the parent drug or its metabolite.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \n\nConstella 290 micrograms hard capsules \n\nlinaclotide \n\n \n\n. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if  \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Constella is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Constella  \n\n3. How to take Constella  \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Constella \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Constella is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Constella is used for \n\nConstella contains the active substance linaclotide. It is used to treat the symptoms of moderate to severe \n\nirritable bowel syndrome (often just called \u201cIBS\u201d) with constipation in adult patients. \n\n \n\nIBS is a common gut disorder.  The main symptoms of IBS with constipation include: \n\n\u2022 stomach or abdominal pain,  \n\n\u2022 feeling bloated,  \n\n\u2022 infrequent, hard, small or pellet-like stools (faeces). \n \n\nThese symptoms may vary from person to person.  \n\n \n\nHow Constella works \n\nConstella acts locally in your gut, helping you to feel less pain and less bloated, and to restore the normal \n\nfunctioning of your bowels. It is not absorbed into the body, but attaches to receptor called guanylate cyclase \n\nC on the surface of your gut. By attaching to this receptor, it blocks the sensation of pain and allows liquid to \n\nenter from the body into the gut, thereby loosening the stools and increasing your bowel movements.  \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Constella  \n\nDo not take Constella \n\n- if you are allergic to linaclotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you or your doctor know that you have a blockage in your stomach or bowels.  \n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nYour doctor has given this medicine to you after excluding other diseases, especially of your bowels and \n\nconcluding that you suffer from IBS with constipation. Because these other diseases may have the same \n\nsymptoms as IBS, it is important that you report any change or irregularity in symptoms to your doctor \n\npromptly. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nIf you experience severe or prolonged diarrhoea (passing of frequent watery stools for 7 days or more), stop \n\ntaking Constella and contact your doctor (see section 4). Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to replace the \n\nwater and electrolytes like potassium lost from the diarrhoea.  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor if you experience bleeding from the bowel or rectum. \n\n \n\nTake special care if you are older than 65 years, as there is a higher risk you experience diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nTake also special care if you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea and an additional disease, such as high \n\nblood pressure, previous disease of the heart and blood vessels (e.g. such as previous heart attacks) or \n\ndiabetes. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor if you suffer from inflammatory diseases of the guts such as Crohn\u2019s disease or  \n\nulcerative colitis as Constella is not recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and \n\nefficacy of Constella in this age group has not been established. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Constella \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines: \n\n\u25aa Some medicines may not work as effectively if you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea, such as: \n- Oral contraceptives. If you have very bad diarrhoea, the contraceptive pill may not work properly and \n\nthe use of an extra method of contraception is recommended. See the instructions in the patient leaflet \n\nof the contraceptive pill you are taking. \n\n- Medicines that need careful and exact dosing, such as levothyroxine (a hormone to treat reduced \nfunction of the thyroid gland). \n\n\u25aa Some medicines may increase the risk of diarrhoea when taken with Constella, such as: \n-  Medicines to treat stomach ulcers or excessive production of stomach acid called Proton Pump \n\nInhibitors. \n\n-  Medicines to treat pain and inflammation called NSAIDs. \n\n-  Laxatives.  \n\n \n\nConstella with food  \n\nConstella produces more frequent bowel movements and diarrhoea (looser stools) when it is taken with food \n\nthan when it is taken on an empty stomach (see section 3). \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nLimited information is available on the effects of Constella in pregnant and breast-feeding women.  \n\n \n\nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nunless your doctor advises you to do so. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, do not take Constella unless your doctor advises to do so. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nConstella will not affect your ability to drive or use machines \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Constella \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \n\nare not sure.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one capsule (i.e. 290 micrograms of linaclotide) taken orally once a day. The \n\ncapsule should be taken at least 30 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nIf you have not experienced improvement in your symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, you should contact \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Constella than you should \n\nThe most likely effect of taking too much Constella is diarrhoea. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you \n\nhave taken too much of this medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Constella \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just take the next dose at the scheduled time and \n\ncontinue as normal. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Constella \n\nIt is preferable to discuss stopping treatment with your doctor before actually doing so.  However, treatment \n\nwith Constella can be safely stopped at any time.  \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea   \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea is normally short lived; however, if you experience severe or prolonged diarrhoea (passing \n\nfrequent or watery stools for 7 days or more) and feel lightheaded, dizzy or faint, stop taking Constella and \n\ncontact your doctor.  \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n \n\n\u2022 stomach or abdominal pain \n\n\u2022 feeling bloated  \n\n\u2022 wind \n\n\u2022 stomach flu (viral gastroenteritis) \n\n\u2022 feeling dizzy \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n \n\n\u2022 lack of control over passing stools (faecal incontinence) \n\n\u2022 urgency to pass stools \n\n\u2022 feeling lightheaded after standing up quickly  \n\n\u2022 dehydration \n\n\u2022 low level of potassium in your blood \n\n\u2022 decreased appetite \n\n\u2022 rectal bleeding \n\n\u2022 bleeding from the bowel or rectum including bleeding from piles/haemorrhoids \n\n\u2022 nausea \n\n\u2022 vomiting \n\n\u2022 hives (urticaria) \n\n \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\n \n\n\u2022 bicarbonate decrease in your blood \n \n\nSide effects with frequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Rash \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your  doctor or pharmacist.

\"ibs\") with constipation in adult patients. ibs is a common gut disorder. the main symptoms of ibs with constipation include: stomach or abdominal pain, feeling bloated, infrequent, hard, small or pellet-like stools (faeces). these symptoms may vary from person to person. how constella works constella acts locally in your gut, helping you to feel less pain and less bloated, and to restore the normal functioning of your bowels. it is not absorbed into the body, but attaches to receptor called guanylate cyclase c on the surface of your gut. by attaching to this receptor, it blocks the sensation of pain and allows liquid to enter from the body into the gut, thereby loosening the stools and increasing your bowel movements.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "constella", "Type":

is important that you report any change or irregularity in symptoms to your doctor promptly. if you experience severe or prolonged diarrhoea (passing of frequent watery stools for 7 days or more), stop taking constella and contact your doctor (see section 4). make sure you drink plenty of fluids to replace the water and electrolytes like potassium lost from the diarrhoea. talk to your doctor if you experience bleeding from the bowel or rectum. take special care if you are older than 65 years, as there is a higher risk you experience diarrhoea. take also special care if you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea and an additional disease, such as high blood pressure, previous disease of the heart and blood vessels (e.g. such as previous heart attacks) or diabetes. talk to your doctor if you suffer from inflammatory diseases of the guts such as crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis as constella is not recommended in these patients. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to

if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines: some medicines may not work as effectively if you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea, such as: - oral contraceptives. if you have very bad diarrhoea, the contraceptive pill may not work properly and the use of an extra method of contraception is recommended. see the instructions in the patient leaflet of the contraceptive pill you are taking. - medicines that need careful and exact dosing, such as levothyroxine (a hormone to treat reduced function of the thyroid gland). some medicines may increase the risk of diarrhoea when taken with constella, such as: - medicines to treat stomach ulcers or excessive production of stomach acid called proton pump inhibitors. - medicines to treat pain and inflammation called nsaids. - laxatives. constella with food constella produces more frequent bowel movements and diarrhoea (looser stools) when it is taken with food than when it is taken on an empty stomach (see section 3).
