This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n\n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nCOMETRIQ 20 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne hard capsule contains cabozantinib (S)-malate equivalent to 20 mg cabozantinib.  \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule. \n\nThe hard capsules are grey with “XL184 20mg” printed in black on the body of the capsule. The capsule \n\ncontains an off-white to white powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nCOMETRIQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced \n\nor metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. \n\n \n\nFor patients in whom rearranged during transfection (RET) mutation status is not known or is negative, a \n\npossible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision (see important \n\ninformation in sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy with COMETRIQ should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of anticancer \n\nmedicinal products.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nCOMETRIQ (cabozantinib) capsules and CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) tablets are not bioequivalent and \n\nshould not be used interchangeably (see section 5.2).  \n\nThe recommended dose of COMETRIQ is 140 mg once daily, taken as one 80 mg orange capsule and three \n\n20 mg grey capsules. Treatment should continue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from \n\ntherapy or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\n \n\nIt should be expected that a majority of patients treated with COMETRIQ will require one or more dose \n\nadjustments (reduction and/or interruption) due to toxicity. Patients should therefore be closely monitored \n\nduring the first eight weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nManagement of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction \n\nof COMETRIQ therapy. When dose reduction is necessary, it is recommended to reduce to 100 mg daily, \n\ntaken as one 80 mg orange capsule and one 20 mg grey capsule, and then to 60 mg daily, taken as three \n\n20 mg grey capsules.  \n\n \n\nDose interruptions are recommended for management of CTCAE grade 3 or greater toxicities or intolerable \n\ngrade 2 toxicities.  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nDose reductions are recommended for events that, if persistent, could become serious or intolerable. \n\n \n\nAs most events can occur early in the course of treatment, the physician should evaluate the patient closely \n\nduring the first eight weeks of treatment to determine if dose modifications are warranted. Events that \n\ngenerally have early onset include hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, palmar-\n\nplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), and gastrointestinal (GI) events (abdominal or mouth pain, \n\nmucosal inflammation, constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting).  \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of some serious adverse reactions (like GI fistula) might be dependent on the cumulative \n\ndose and might present in a later stage of treatment. \n\n \n\nIf a patient misses a dose, the missed dose should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours before the next dose. \n\n \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \n\nConcomitant medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be used with caution, and \n\nchronic use of concomitant medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSelection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce or inhibit \n\nCYP3A4 should be considered. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo specific dose adjustment for the use of cabozantinib in older people (≥ 65 years) is recommended. \n\nHowever, a trend in increased rate of SAEs has been observed in subjects aged 75 years and older. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThere is little experience with cabozantinib in non-White patients.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\nCabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \n\nCabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment as safety and efficacy \n\nhave not been established in this population. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment the recommended dose of cabozantinib is 60 mg once \n\ndaily. Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in these patients (see section 5.2) as dose \n\nadjustment or interruption may be required. Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population. \n\n \n\nPatients with cardiac impairment \n\nThere is limited data in patients with cardiac impairment. No specific dosing recommendations can be made. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in children aged <18 years have not yet been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nCOMETRIQ is for oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole and not opened. Patients should be \n\ninstructed to not eat anything for at least 2 hours before through 1 hour after taking COMETRIQ. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nDose reductions and dose interruptions occurred in 79% and 72%, respectively, of cabozantinib-treated \n\npatients in the pivotal clinical study. Two dose reductions were required in 41% of patients. The median time \n\nto first dose reduction was 43 days, and to first dose interruption was 33 days. Close monitoring of patients is \n\ntherefore recommended during the first eight weeks of therapy (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPerforations, fistulas, and intra-abdominal abscesses  \n\nSerious gastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulas, sometimes fatal, and intra-abdominal abscesses have \n\nbeen observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have had recent radiotherapy, have inflammatory bowel \n\ndisease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, peritonitis, or diverticulitis), have tumour infiltration of \n\ntrachea, bronchi, or oesophagus, have complications from prior GI surgery (particularly when associated \n\nwith delayed or incomplete healing), or have complications from prior radiation therapy to the thoracic \n\ncavity (including mediastinum) should be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy and \n\nsubsequently they should be monitored closely for symptoms of perforations and fistulas. Non-GI fistula \nshould be ruled out as appropriate in cases of onset of mucositis after start of therapy. Cabozantinib should \n\nbe discontinued in patients who experience a GI perforation or a GI or non-GI fistula. \n\n \n\nThromboembolic events \n\nEvents of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism and events of arterial \n\nthromboembolism, sometimes fatal, have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib should be used \n\nwith caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these events. Cabozantinib should be \n\ndiscontinued in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or any other clinically significant \n\narterial thromboembolic complication. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nSevere haemorrhage, sometimes fatal, has been observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have evidence of \n\ninvolvement of the trachea or bronchi by tumour or a history of haemoptysis prior to treatment initiation \n\nshould be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy. Cabozantinib should not be \n\nadministered to patients with serious haemorrhage or recent haemoptysis. \n\n \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \n\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the formation of \n\naneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating cabozantinib, this risk should be carefully considered \n\nin patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal (GI) disorders  \n\nDiarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, decreased appetite, and stomatitis/oral pain were some of the most commonly \n\nreported GI adverse reactions (see section 4.8). Prompt medical management, including supportive care with \n\nantiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, or antacids, should be instituted to prevent dehydration, electrolyte imbalances \n\nand weight loss. Dose interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of cabozantinib should be \n\nconsidered in case of persistent or recurrent significant GI adverse reactions (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nWound complications \n\nWound complications have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib treatment should be stopped at \n\nleast 28 days prior to scheduled surgery, including dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. \n\nThe decision to resume cabozantinib therapy after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate \n\nwound healing. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients with wound healing complications requiring \n\nmedical intervention. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nHypertension has been observed with cabozantinib. All patients should be monitored for hypertension and \n\ntreated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. In the case of persistent hypertension despite use \n\nof anti-hypertensives, the cabozantinib dose should be reduced. Cabozantinib should be discontinued if \n\nhypertension is severe and persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction of cabozantinib.  \n\nIn case of hypertensive crisis, cabozantinib should be discontinued. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\nEvents of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have been observed with cabozantinib. An oral examination should \n\nbe performed prior to initiation of cabozantinib and periodically during cabozantinib therapy. Patients should \n\nbe advised regarding oral hygiene practice. Cabozantinib treatment should be held at least 28 days prior to \n\nscheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Caution should be used in patients \n\nreceiving agents associated with ONJ, such as bisphosphonates. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in \n\npatients who experience ONJ. \n\n \n\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome  \n\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) has been observed with cabozantinib. When PPES is \n\nsevere, interruption of treatment with cabozantinib should be considered. Cabozantinib should be restarted \n\nwith a lower dose when PPES has been resolved to grade 1. \n\n \n\nProteinuria \n\nProteinuria has been observed with cabozantinib. Urine protein should be monitored regularly during \n\ncabozantinib treatment. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. \n\n \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been observed with cabozantinib. PRES should be \n\nconsidered in any patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of the diagnosis, including seizures, \n\nheadache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Cabozantinib treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued in patients with PRES. \n\n \n\nProlongation of QT interval \n\nCabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, patients who \n\nare taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte \n\ndisturbances. When using cabozantinib, periodic monitoring with on-treatment ECGs and electrolytes (serum \n\ncalcium, potassium, and magnesium) should be considered. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitors, which may increase cabozantinib plasma concentrations, should be used with caution. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors \n\nCabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitor ketoconazole resulted in an increase in cabozantinib plasma exposure. Caution is required when \n\nadministering cabozantinib with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concurrent administration of \n\ncabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a decrease in cabozantinib plasma \n\nexposure. Therefore chronic administration of agents that are strong CYP3A4 inducers with cabozantinib \n\nshould be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein substrates  \n\nCabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport \n\nactivities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the \n\npotential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be \n\ncautioned regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, \n\ndigoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan) while \n\nreceiving cabozantinib. \n \n\nMRP2 inhibitors \n\nAdministration of MRP2 inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations. Therefore, \n\nconcomitant use of MRP2 inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine, efavirenz, emtricitabine) should be approached with \n\ncaution. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nEffect of other medicinal products on cabozantinib \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers \n\nAdministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy \n\nvolunteers decreased cabozantinib clearance (by 29%) and increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib \n\nexposure (AUC) by 38%. Therefore co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, \n\nitraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) with cabozantinib should be approached with \n\ncaution.  \n\n \n\nAdministration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy volunteers \n\nincreased cabozantinib clearance (4.3-fold) and decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) \n\nby 77%. Chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, \n\nphenobarbital or herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]) with cabozantinib \n\nshould therefore be avoided.  \n\n \n\nGastric pH modifying agents \n\nCo-administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single dose \n\nof 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers resulted in no clinically-significant effect on plasma \n\ncabozantinib exposure (AUC). No dose adjustment is indicated when gastric pH modifying agents (i.e., PPIs, \n\nH2 receptor antagonists, and antacids) are co-administered with cabozantinib. \n\n \n\nMRP2 inhibitors \n\nIn vitro data demonstrate that cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2. Therefore, administration of MRP2 \n\ninhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\nBile salt-sequestering agents \n\nBile salt-sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and cholestagel may interact with cabozantinib and may \n\nimpact absorption (or reabsorption) resulting in potentially decreased exposure (see section 5.2). The clinical \n\nsignificance of these potential interactions is unknown. \n\n \n\nEffect of cabozantinib on other medicinal products \n\nThe effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been investigated. As \n\nunchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive method, such as a barrier \n\nmethod, is recommended. \n\nBecause of high plasma protein binding levels of cabozantinib (section 5.2) a plasma protein displacement \n\ninteraction with warfarin may be possible. In case of such combination, INR values should be monitored. \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein substrates  \n\nCabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities in a \n\nbi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the potential to \n\nincrease plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be cautioned \n\nregarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, \n\ncolchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan) while receiving \n\ncabozantinib. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on cabozantinib. Female \n\npartners of male patients taking cabozantinib must also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of contraception \n\nshould be used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for at least 4 months after \n\ncompleting therapy. Because oral contraceptives might possibly not be considered as “effective methods of \n\ncontraception,” they should be used together with another method, such as a barrier method (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no studies in pregnant women using cabozantinib. Studies in animals have shown embryo-foetal \n\nand teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Cabozantinib should not \n\nbe used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with cabozantinib. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether cabozantinib and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the \n\npotential harm to the infant, mothers should discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with cabozantinib, \n\nand for at least 4 months after completing therapy. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data on human fertility. Based on non-clinical safety findings, male and female fertility may be \n\ncompromised by treatment with cabozantinib (see section 5.3). Both men and women should be advised to \n\nseek advice and consider fertility preservation before treatment. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nCabozantinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such as fatigue \n\nand weakness have been associated with cabozantinib.  Therefore, caution should be recommended when \n\ndriving or operating machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\nThe most common serious adverse reactions associated with cabozantinib are pneumonia, mucosal \ninflammation, hypocalcaemia, dysphagia, dehydration, pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. The most \n\nfrequent adverse reactions of any grade (experienced by at least 20% of patients) included diarrhoea, PPES, \n\nweight decreased, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, dysgeusia, hair colour changes, hypertension, \n\nstomatitis, constipation, vomiting, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, and dysphonia. \n\n \n\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities were increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased \n\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lymphopenia, hypocalcaemia, \n\nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypophosphataemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypomagnesaemia, and \n\nhypokalaemia. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 1 according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency categories. \n\nFrequencies are based on all grades and defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

This effect was not associated with a change in cardiac \n\nwave form morphology or new rhythms. No cabozantinib-treated subjects had a QTcF >500 ms. \n\n \n\nPlease refer to section 4.4 for recommendations about the monitoring and management of the following \n\nadverse events: perforations, fistulas, and intra-abdominal abscesses; thromboembolic events; haemorrhage; \n\naneurysms and artery dissections; gastrointestinal disorders; wound complications; hypertension; \n\nosteonecrosis; palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome; proteinuria; and posterior reversible \n\nencephalopathy syndrome. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no specific treatment for cabozantinib overdose and possible symptoms of overdose have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nIn the event of suspected overdose, cabozantinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. \n\nMetabolic clinical laboratory parameters should be monitored at least weekly or as deemed clinically \n\nappropriate to assess any possible changing trends. Adverse reactions associated with overdose are to be \n\ntreated symptomatically. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE26. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nCabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in \n\ntumour growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodelling, and metastatic progression of cancer. \n\nCabozantinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases and was identified as an \n\ninhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) \n\nreceptors. In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine kinases including RET, the GAS6 receptor (AXL), \n\nthe stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nCabozantinib exhibited dose-related tumour growth inhibition, tumour regression, and/or inhibited metastasis \n\nin a broad range of preclinical tumour models. \n\n \n\nEfficacy with cabozantinib was observed in medullary thyroid cancer patients with wild-type or mutant RET. \n\n \n\nClinical data in medullary thyroid cancer \n\nA multi-center, randomised double-blind study comparing cabozantinib (N = 219) with placebo (N = 111) \n\nwas conducted in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC and documented \n\nradiographic disease progression within 14 months prior to study entry. The primary objective was to \n\ncompare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving cabozantinib versus patients receiving placebo. \n\nThe secondary objectives were to compare overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). \n\nCentralized, independent, blinded review of the imaging data was used in the assessment of PFS and ORR. \n\nPatients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n\n \n\nThe result of the PFS analysis, based on the central review RECIST assessment, demonstrated a statistically \n\nsignificant difference in the duration of PFS with cabozantinib versus placebo: the median duration was \n\n11.2 months for subjects in the cabozantinib arm versus 4.0 months for subjects in the placebo arm (stratified \n\nHazard Ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.40; p<0.0001; Figure 1). The PFS results were consistent across \n\nall baseline and demographic subgroups evaluated, including prior therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors \n\n(which may have consisted of agents targeting pathways associated with anti-angiogenesis), RET mutational \n\nstatus (including subjects documented not to have RET mutations), prior anticancer or radiotherapy status, or \n\nthe existence of bone metastases. \n\n \n\nThe ORR was 27.9% and 0% for subjects in the cabozantinib arm and placebo arm, respectively (p<0.0001; \n\nTable 2). The median duration of objective responses was 14.6 months (95% CI: 11.1, 17.5) for subjects in \n\nthe cabozantinib arm.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan Meier curve of progression free survival \n\n \n\n \n \n\nNumber of subjects at risk \n\nMonth 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 \n\nCometriq 219 121 78 55 31 12 2 1 \n\nPlacebo 111 35 11 6 3 2 0 0 \n\n \n\nThe final analysis of OS was conducted after 218 events (deaths) occurred and shows a trend for an increase \n\nin median survival of 5.5 months in the cabozantinib arm: median (months) 26.6 cabozantinib vs. \n\n21.1 placebo (HR = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.12], p = 0.2409). \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier curve of overall survival \n\n \n\n \n0 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 6 0 7 2\n\n0 .0\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .8\n\n1 .0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMonths \n\n \n \n\n0 12 24 \n0.0 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \n\n1.0 Placebo (n=111) \n\nCometriq (n=219) \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n  \n\nCometriq (n=219) \n\nPlacebo (n=111) \n\nMonths \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nTable 2: Summary of key efficacy findings \n\n \n\n Cabozantinib Placebo \n\nMedian progression-free survival  \n\n11.2 months 4.0 months \n\nHR: 0.28 (0.19, 0.40) \n\np <0.0001 \n\nMedian overall survival  \n\n26.6 months 21.1 months \n\nHR: 0.85 (0.64, 1.12) \n\np = 0.2409 \n\nOverall response ratea (95% CI) \n\n27.9% \n\n(21.9%, 34.5%) \n\n0% \n\np <0.0001 \n\nDuration of response; median (95% CI) \n14.6 months \n\n(11.1, 17.5) \n\nN/A \n\nDisease control rate b (95% CI) \n55.3% \n\n (48.3%, 62.2%) \n\n13.5% \n\n(7.6%, 21.6%) \n\nCalcitonin responsea \n47%  \n\n(49/104)c \n\n3%  \n\n(1/40) c \n\nCEA responsea \n33%  \n\n(47/143) c \n\n2%  \n\n(1/55)c \na Response = CR + PR \nb Disease Control Rate = SD+ ORR \nc Includes patients who were evaluable for response \n\n \n\nRET mutation status \n\nOf the 215 subjects with sufficient data to determine mutational status, 78.6% (n=169) were classified as \n\nRET mutation positive (126 of which were positive for the M918T mutation), and 21.4% (n=46) were \n\nclassified as RET mutation negative. For an additional 115 subjects the RET mutational status could not be \n\ndetermined or was unclear. All three subgroups showed increased PFS in the cabozantinib arm compared to \n\nthe placebo arm (HRs of 0.23, 0.53, and 0.30 for RET mutation positive, negative, and unknown subgroups, \n\nrespectively). The objective response rates measured in these subgroups were generally consistent with the \n\nPFS results, with the RET mutation positive, negative, and unknown subgroups showing tumour response \n\nrates of 32%, 22%, and 25%, respectively. \n\n \n\nFurther genetic analysis showed that a small proportion of patients harboured somatic tumour mutations in \n\nHRAS, KRAS, or NRAS. These patients (n=16) showed significant prolongation of PFS (HR of 0.15) and an \n\nobjective response rate of 31%. RET mutation negative patients with no evidence of RAS mutation (n=33) \n\nshowed a decreased PFS benefit on cabozantinib (HR of 0.87) and a lower response rate of 18% compared to \n\nother mutational subgroups. \n\n \n\nA significant improvement in OS was observed in the subgroup of RET M918T mutation positive patients \n\n(n=81/219 cabozantinib arm): 44.3 months in the cabozantinib arm vs. 18.9 months in the placebo arm \n\n(HR = 0.60, p = 0.0255). There was no improvement in OS for the RET M918T negative and unknown \n\nsubgroups. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier analysis of OS among subjects with a RET M918T mutation \n\n \n\n0 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 6 0 7 2\n\n0 .0\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .8\n\n1 .0\n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\ncabozantinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant solid tumours \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means that \n\nfurther evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year \n\nand this SmPC will be updated as necessary \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral administration of cabozantinib, peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations are reached at 2 to \n\n5 hours post-dose. Plasma-concentration time profiles show a second absorption peak approximately \n\n24 hours after administration, which suggests that cabozantinib may undergo enterohepatic recirculation. \n\n \n\nRepeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in an approximately a 4- to 5-fold mean \n\ncabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state is \n\nachieved by approximately Day 15.   \n\n \n\nA high-fat meal moderately increased Cmax and AUC values (41% and 57%, respectively) relative to fasted \n\nconditions in healthy volunteers administered a single 140 mg oral cabozantinib dose. There is no \n\ninformation on the precise food-effect when taken 1 hour after administration of cabozantinib. \n\nBioequivalence could not be demonstrated between the cabozantinib capsule and tablet formulations \n\nfollowing a single 140 mg dose in healthy subjects. A 19% increase in the Cmax of the tablet formulation \n\n(CABOMETYX) compared to the capsule formulation (COMETRIQ) was observed. AUC were similar \n\nbetween cabozantinib tablet (CABOMETYX) and capsule (COMETRIQ) formulations (<10% difference). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nCabozantinib is highly protein bound in vitro in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Based on the population-\n\npharmacokinetic (PK) model, the volume of distribution (V/F) is approximately 349 L (SE: ± 2.73%). \n\nProtein binding was not altered in subjects with mild or moderately impaired renal or hepatic function. \n\n \n\nCometriq (n=81) \n\nPlacebo (n=45) \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n \n\nMonths \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nBiotransformation \n\nCabozantinib was metabolized in vivo. Four metabolites were present in plasma at exposures (AUC) greater \n\nthan 10% of parent: XL184-N-oxide, XL184 amide cleavage product, XL184 monohydroxy sulfate, and \n\n6-desmethyl amide cleavage product sulfate. Two non-conjugated metabolites (XL184-N-oxide and XL184 \n\namide cleavage product), which possess <1% of the on-target kinase inhibition potency of parent \n\ncabozantinib, each represent <10% of total drug-related plasma exposure. \n\n \n\nCabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 metabolism in vitro, as a neutralizing antibody to CYP3A4 inhibited \n\nformation of metabolite XL184 N-oxide by >80% in a NADPH-catalyzed human liver microsomal (HLM) \n\nincubation; in contrast, neutralizing antibodies to CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, \n\nCYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. A neutralizing antibody to \n\nCYP2C9 showed a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (ie, a <20% reduction). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe plasma terminal half-life of cabozantinib in single dose studies in healthy volunteers is approximately \n\n120 hours. Mean clearance (CL/F) at steady-state in cancer patients was estimated to be 4.4 L/hr in a \n\npopulation PK analysis. Within a 48-day collection period after a single dose of 14C-cabozantinib in healthy \n\nvolunteers, approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with 54% in faeces and \n\n27% in urine.  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nResults from a study in patients with renal impairment indicate that the ratios of geometric LS mean for \n\nplasma cabozantinib, Cmax and AUC0-inf were 19% and 30% higher, for subjects with mild renal impairment \n\n(90% CI for Cmax 91.60% to 155.51%; AUC0-inf 98.79% to 171.26%) and 2% and 6-7% higher (90% CI for \n\nCmax 78.64% to 133.52%; AUC0-inf 79.61% to 140.11%), for subjects with moderate renal impairment \n\ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been \n\nstudied. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nResults from a study in patients with hepatic impairment indicate that exposure (AUC0-inf) increased by 81% \n\nand 63% in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively (90% CI for AUC0-inf: \n\n121.44% to 270.34% for mild and 107.37% to 246.67% for moderate). Patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment have not been studied. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nNo data are available to determine a difference in PK based on race. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical \n\nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n\n \n\nIn rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months duration, target organs for toxicity were GI tract, \n\nbone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal and reproductive tract tissues. The no observed adverse \n\neffect level (NOAEL) for these findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nCabozantinib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity assays.  \n\nThe carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 transgenic mice and \n\nSprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, cabozantinib-related neoplastic findings \n\nconsisted of an increased incidence of benign pheochromocytoma, alone or in combination with malignant \n\npheochromocytoma/complex malignant pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla in both sexes at \n\nexposures well below the intended exposure in humans. The clinical relevance of the observed neoplastic \n\nlesions in rats is uncertain, but likely to be low. Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in the rasH2 mouse \n\nmodel at a slightly higher exposure than the intended human therapeutic exposure.  \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nFertility studies in rats have shown reduced male and female fertility. Further, hypospermatogenesis was \n\nobserve in male dogs at exposure levels below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose.  \n\n \n\nEmbryo-foetal development studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats, cabozantinib caused \n\npostimplantation loss, foetal oedema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked or rudimentary tail. In \n\nrabbits, cabozantinib produced foetal soft tissue changes (reduced spleen size, small or missing intermediate \n\nlung lobe) and increased foetal incidence of total malformations. NOAEL for embryo-foetal toxicity and \n\nteratogenic findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose.   \n\n \n\nJuvenile rats (comparable to a >2 year old pediatric population) administered cabozantinib showed increased \n\nWBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female reproductive system (without \n\ndelayed vaginal opening), tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral content and density, liver pigmentation \n\nand bile duct hyperplasia. Findings in uterus/ovaries and decreased haematopoiesis appeared to be transient, \n\nwhile effects on bone parameters and liver pigmentation were sustained. Evaluations in juvenile rats \n\n(comparable to a <2 year old pediatric population) have not been performed. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne hard capsule contains cabozantinib (S)-malate equivalent to 20 mg or 80 mg cabozantinib.  \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule. \n\n \n\nThe hard capsules are grey with “XL184 20mg” printed in black on the body of the capsule. The capsule \n\ncontains an off-white to white powder. \n\n \n\nThe hard capsules are orange with “XL184 80mg” printed in black on the body of the capsule. The capsule \n\ncontains an off-white to white powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nCOMETRIQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced \n\nor metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. \n\n \n\nFor patients in whom rearranged during transfection (RET) mutation status is not known or is negative, a \n\npossible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision (see important \n\ninformation in sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \nTherapy with COMETRIQ should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of anticancer \n\nmedicinal products.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nCOMETRIQ (cabozantinib) capsules and CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) tablets are not bioequivalent and \n\nshould not be used interchangeably (see section 5.2).  \n\nThe recommended dose of COMETRIQ is 140 mg once daily, taken as one 80 mg orange capsule and three \n\n20 mg grey capsules. Treatment should continue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from \n\ntherapy or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\n \n\nIt should be expected that a majority of patients treated with COMETRIQ will require one or more dose \n\nadjustments (reduction and/or interruption) due to toxicity. Patients should therefore be closely monitored \n\nduring the first eight weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nManagement of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction \n\nof COMETRIQ therapy. When dose reduction is necessary, it is recommended to reduce to 100 mg daily, \n\ntaken as one 80 mg orange capsule and one 20 mg grey capsule, and then to 60 mg daily, taken as three \n\n20 mg grey capsules.  \n \nDose interruptions are recommended for management of CTCAE grade 3 or greater toxicities or intolerable \n\ngrade 2 toxicities.  \n\n \n\nDose reductions are recommended for events that, if persistent, could become serious or intolerable. \n\n \n\nAs most events can occur early in the course of treatment, the physician should evaluate the patient closely \n\nduring the first eight weeks of treatment to determine if dose modifications are warranted. Events that \n\ngenerally have early onset include hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, palmar-\n\nplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), and gastrointestinal (GI) events (abdominal or mouth pain, \n\nmucosal inflammation, constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting).  \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of some serious adverse reactions (like GI fistula) might be dependent on the cumulative \n\ndose and might present in a later stage of treatment. \n\n \nIf a patient misses a dose, the missed dose should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours before the next dose. \n\n \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \n\nConcomitant medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be used with caution, and \n\nchronic use of concomitant medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSelection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce or inhibit \n\nCYP3A4 should be considered. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo specific dose adjustment for the use of cabozantinib in older people (≥ 65 years) is recommended. \n\nHowever, a trend in increased rate of SAEs has been observed in subjects aged 75 years and older. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThere is little experience with cabozantinib in non-White patients.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\nCabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \n\nCabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment as safety and efficacy \n\nhave not been established in this population. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment the recommended dose of cabozantinib is 60 mg once \n\ndaily. Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in these patients (see section 5.2) as dose \n\nadjustment or interruption may be required. Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population. \n\n \n\nPatients with cardiac impairment \n\nThere is limited data in patients with cardiac impairment. No specific dosing recommendations can be made. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in children aged <18 years have not yet been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nCOMETRIQ is for oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole and not opened. Patients should be \n\ninstructed to not eat anything for at least 2 hours before through 1 hour after taking COMETRIQ. \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nDose reductions and dose interruptions occurred in 79% and 72%, respectively, of cabozantinib-treated \n\npatients in the pivotal clinical study. Two dose reductions were required in 41% of patients. The median time \n\nto first dose reduction was 43 days, and to first dose interruption was 33 days. Close monitoring of patients is \n\ntherefore recommended during the first eight weeks of therapy (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPerforations, fistulas, and intra-abdominal abscesses  \n\nSerious gastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulas, sometimes fatal, and intra-abdominal abscesses have \n\nbeen observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have had recent radiotherapy, have inflammatory bowel \n\ndisease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, peritonitis, or diverticulitis), have tumour infiltration of \n\ntrachea, bronchi, or oesophagus, have complications from prior GI surgery (particularly when associated \n\nwith delayed or incomplete healing), or have complications from prior radiation therapy to the thoracic \n\ncavity (including mediastinum) should be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy and \n\nsubsequently they should be monitored closely for symptoms of perforations and fistulas. Non-GI fistula \nshould be ruled out as appropriate in cases of onset of mucositis after start of therapy. Cabozantinib should \n\nbe discontinued in patients who experience a GI perforation or a GI or non-GI fistula. \n\n \n\nThromboembolic events \n\nEvents of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism and events of arterial \n\nthromboembolism, sometimes fatal, have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib should be used \n\nwith caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these events. Cabozantinib should be \n\ndiscontinued in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or any other clinically significant \n\narterial thromboembolic complication. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nSevere haemorrhage, sometimes fatal, has been observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have evidence of \n\ninvolvement of the trachea or bronchi by tumour or a history of haemoptysis prior to treatment initiation \n\nshould be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy. Cabozantinib should not be \n\nadministered to patients with serious haemorrhage or recent haemoptysis. \n\n \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \n\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the formation of \n\naneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating cabozantinib, this risk should be carefully considered \n\nin patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal (GI) disorders  \n\nDiarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, decreased appetite, and stomatitis/oral pain were some of the most commonly \n\nreported GI adverse reactions (see section 4.8). Prompt medical management, including supportive care with \n\nantiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, or antacids, should be instituted to prevent dehydration, electrolyte imbalances \n\nand weight loss. Dose interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of cabozantinib should be \n\nconsidered in case of persistent or recurrent significant GI adverse reactions (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nWound complications \n\nWound complications have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib treatment should be stopped at \n\nleast 28 days prior to scheduled surgery, including dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. \n\nThe decision to resume cabozantinib therapy after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate \n\nwound healing. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients with wound healing complications requiring \n\nmedical intervention. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nHypertension has been observed with cabozantinib. All patients should be monitored for hypertension and \n\ntreated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. In the case of persistent hypertension despite use \n\nof anti-hypertensives, the cabozantinib dose should be reduced. Cabozantinib should be discontinued if \n\nhypertension is severe and persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction of cabozantinib.  \n\nIn case of hypertensive crisis, cabozantinib should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\nEvents of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have been observed with cabozantinib. An oral examination should \n\nbe performed prior to initiation of cabozantinib and periodically during cabozantinib therapy. Patients should \n\nbe advised regarding oral hygiene practice. Cabozantinib treatment should be held at least 28 days prior to \n\nscheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Caution should be used in patients \n\nreceiving agents associated with ONJ, such as bisphosphonates. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in \n\npatients who experience ONJ. \n\n \n\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome  \n\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) has been observed with cabozantinib. When PPES is \n\nsevere, interruption of treatment with cabozantinib should be considered. Cabozantinib should be restarted \n\nwith a lower dose when PPES has been resolved to grade 1. \n\n \n\nProteinuria \n\nProteinuria has been observed with cabozantinib. Urine protein should be monitored regularly during \n\ncabozantinib treatment. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. \n\n \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been observed with cabozantinib. PRES should be \n\nconsidered in any patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of the diagnosis, including seizures, \n\nheadache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Cabozantinib treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued in patients with PRES. \n\n \n\nProlongation of QT interval \n\nCabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, patients who \n\nare taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte \n\ndisturbances. When using cabozantinib, periodic monitoring with on-treatment ECGs and electrolytes (serum \n\ncalcium, potassium, and magnesium) should be considered. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitors, which may increase cabozantinib plasma concentrations, should be used with caution. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors \n\nCabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitor ketoconazole resulted in an increase in cabozantinib plasma exposure. Caution is required when \n\nadministering cabozantinib with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concurrent administration of \n\ncabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a decrease in cabozantinib plasma \n\nexposure. Therefore chronic administration of agents that are strong CYP3A4 inducers with cabozantinib \n\nshould be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein substrates  \n\nCabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport \n\nactivities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the \n\npotential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be \n\ncautioned regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, \n\ndigoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan) while \n\nreceiving cabozantinib. \n\n \n\nMRP2 inhibitors \n\nAdministration of MRP2 inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations. Therefore, \n\nconcomitant use of MRP2 inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine, efavirenz, emtricitabine) should be approached with \n\ncaution. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nEffect of other medicinal products on cabozantinib \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers \n\nAdministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy \n\nvolunteers decreased cabozantinib clearance (by 29%) and increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib \n\nexposure (AUC) by 38%. Therefore co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, \n\nitraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) with cabozantinib should be approached with \n\ncaution.  \n\n \n\nAdministration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy volunteers \n\nincreased cabozantinib clearance (4.3-fold) and decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) \n\nby 77%. Chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, \n\nphenobarbital or herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]) with cabozantinib \n\nshould therefore be avoided.  \n\n \n\nGastric pH modifying agents \n\nCo-administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single dose \n\nof 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers resulted in no clinically-significant effect on plasma \n\ncabozantinib exposure (AUC). No dose adjustment is indicated when gastric pH modifying agents (i.e., PPIs, \n\nH2 receptor antagonists, and antacids) are co-administered with cabozantinib. \n\n \n\nMRP2 inhibitors \n\nIn vitro data demonstrate that cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2. Therefore, administration of MRP2 \n\ninhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\nBile salt-sequestering agents \n\nBile salt-sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and cholestagel may interact with cabozantinib and may \n\nimpact absorption (or reabsorption) resulting in potentially decreased exposure (see section 5.2). The clinical \n\nsignificance of these potential interactions is unknown. \n\n \n\nEffect of cabozantinib on other medicinal products \n\nThe effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been investigated. As \n\nunchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive method, such as a barrier \n\nmethod, is recommended. \n\nBecause of high plasma protein binding levels of cabozantinib (section 5.2) a plasma protein displacement \n\ninteraction with warfarin may be possible. In case of such combination, INR values should be monitored. \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein substrates  \n\nCabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities in a \n\nbi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the potential to \n\nincrease plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be cautioned \n\nregarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, \n\ncolchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan) while receiving \n\ncabozantinib. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on cabozantinib. Female \n\npartners of male patients taking cabozantinib must also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of contraception \n\nshould be used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for at least 4 months after \n\ncompleting therapy. Because oral contraceptives might possibly not be considered as “effective methods of \n\ncontraception,” they should be used together with another method, such as a barrier method (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no studies in pregnant women using cabozantinib. Studies in animals have shown embryo-foetal \n\nand teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Cabozantinib should not \n\nbe used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with cabozantinib. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether cabozantinib and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the \n\npotential harm to the infant, mothers should discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with cabozantinib, \n\nand for at least 4 months after completing therapy. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data on human fertility. Based on non-clinical safety findings, male and female fertility may be \n\ncompromised by treatment with cabozantinib (see section 5.3). Both men and women should be advised to \n\nseek advice and consider fertility preservation before treatment. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nCabozantinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such as fatigue \n\nand weakness have been associated with cabozantinib.

Ninety-two percent of \n\npatients on the cabozantinib arm had a prior thyroidectomy, and 89% were taking thyroid hormones prior to \n\nfirst dose. \n\n \n\nAn increase from baseline in corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) of 10 - 15 ms on Day 29 (but not on \n\nDay 1) following initiation of cabozantinib treatment (at a dose of 140 mg qd) was observed in a controlled \n\nclinical study in cancer patients (see section 4.4). This effect was not associated with a change in cardiac \n\nwave form morphology or new rhythms. No cabozantinib-treated subjects had a QTcF >500 ms. \n\n \n\nPlease refer to section 4.4 for recommendations about the monitoring and management of the following \n\nadverse events: perforations, fistulas, and intra-abdominal abscesses; thromboembolic events; haemorrhage; \n\naneurysms and artery dissections; gastrointestinal disorders; wound complications; hypertension; \n\nosteonecrosis; palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome; proteinuria; and posterior reversible \n\nencephalopathy syndrome. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no specific treatment for cabozantinib overdose and possible symptoms of overdose have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nIn the event of suspected overdose, cabozantinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. \n\nMetabolic clinical laboratory parameters should be monitored at least weekly or as deemed clinically \n\nappropriate to assess any possible changing trends. Adverse reactions associated with overdose are to be \n\ntreated symptomatically. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE26. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nCabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in \n\ntumour growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodelling, and metastatic progression of cancer. \n\nCabozantinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases and was identified as an \n\ninhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) \n\nreceptors. In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine kinases including RET, the GAS6 receptor (AXL), \n\nthe stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3).    \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nCabozantinib exhibited dose-related tumour growth inhibition, tumour regression, and/or inhibited metastasis \n\nin a broad range of preclinical tumour models. \n\n \n\nEfficacy with cabozantinib was observed in medullary thyroid cancer patients with wild-type or mutant RET. \n\n \n\nClinical data in medullary thyroid cancer \n\nA multi-center, randomised double-blind study comparing cabozantinib (N = 219) with placebo (N = 111) \n\nwas conducted in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC and documented \n\nradiographic disease progression within 14 months prior to study entry. The primary objective was to \n\ncompare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving cabozantinib versus patients receiving placebo. \n\nThe secondary objectives were to compare overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). \n\nCentralized, independent, blinded review of the imaging data was used in the assessment of PFS and ORR. \n\nPatients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n\n \n\nThe result of the PFS analysis, based on the central review RECIST assessment, demonstrated a statistically \n\nsignificant difference in the duration of PFS with cabozantinib versus placebo: the median duration was \n\n11.2 months for subjects in the cabozantinib arm versus 4.0 months for subjects in the placebo arm (stratified \n\nHazard Ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.40; p<0.0001; Figure 1). The PFS results were consistent across \n\nall baseline and demographic subgroups evaluated, including prior therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors \n\n(which may have consisted of agents targeting pathways associated with anti-angiogenesis), RET mutational \n\nstatus (including subjects documented not to have RET mutations), prior anticancer or radiotherapy status, or \n\nthe existence of bone metastases. \n\n \n\nThe ORR was 27.9% and 0% for subjects in the cabozantinib arm and placebo arm, respectively (p<0.0001; \n\nTable 2). The median duration of objective responses was 14.6 months (95% CI: 11.1, 17.5) for subjects in \n\nthe cabozantinib arm.  \n \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan Meier curve of progression free survival \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNumber of subjects at risk \n\nMonth 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 \n\nCometriq 219 121 78 55 31 12 2 1 \n\nPlacebo 111 35 11 6 3 2 0 0 \n\n \n\nMonths \n\n \n \n\n0 12 24 \n0.0 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \n\n1.0 Placebo (n=111) \n\nCometriq (n=219) \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nThe final analysis of OS was conducted after 218 events (deaths) occurred and shows a trend for an increase \n\nin median survival of 5.5 months in the cabozantinib arm: median (months) 26.6 cabozantinib vs. \n\n21.1 placebo (HR = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.12], p = 0.2409). \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier curve of overall survival \n\n \n\n \n0 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 6 0 7 2\n\n0 .0\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .8\n\n1 .0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Summary of key efficacy findings \n\n \n\n Cabozantinib Placebo \n\nMedian progression-free survival  \n\n11.2 months 4.0 months \n\nHR: 0.28 (0.19, 0.40) \n\np <0.0001 \n\nMedian overall survival  \n\n26.6 months 21.1 months \n\nHR: 0.85 (0.64, 1.12) \n\np = 0.2409 \n\nOverall response ratea (95% CI) \n\n27.9% \n\n(21.9%, 34.5%) \n\n0% \n\np <0.0001 \n\nDuration of response; median (95% CI) \n14.6 months \n\n(11.1, 17.5) \n\nN/A \n\nDisease control rate b (95% CI) \n55.3% \n\n (48.3%, 62.2%) \n\n13.5% \n\n(7.6%, 21.6%) \n\nCalcitonin responsea \n47%  \n\n(49/104)c \n\n3%  \n\n(1/40) c \n\nCEA responsea \n33%  \n\n(47/143) c \n\n2%  \n\n(1/55)c \na Response = CR + PR \nb Disease Control Rate = SD+ ORR \nc Includes patients who were evaluable for response \n\n \n\nRET mutation status \n\nOf the 215 subjects with sufficient data to determine mutational status, 78.6% (n=169) were classified as \n\nRET mutation positive (126 of which were positive for the M918T mutation), and 21.4% (n=46) were \n\nclassified as RET mutation negative. For an additional 115 subjects the RET mutational status could not be \n\ndetermined or was unclear. All three subgroups showed increased PFS in the cabozantinib arm compared to \n\nthe placebo arm (HRs of 0.23, 0.53, and 0.30 for RET mutation positive, negative, and unknown subgroups, \n\nCometriq (n=219) \n\nPlacebo (n=111) \n\nMonths \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nrespectively). The objective response rates measured in these subgroups were generally consistent with the \n\nPFS results, with the RET mutation positive, negative, and unknown subgroups showing tumour response \n\nrates of 32%, 22%, and 25%, respectively. \n\n \n\nFurther genetic analysis showed that a small proportion of patients harboured somatic tumour mutations in \n\nHRAS, KRAS, or NRAS. These patients (n=16) showed significant prolongation of PFS (HR of 0.15) and an \n\nobjective response rate of 31%. RET mutation negative patients with no evidence of RAS mutation (n=33) \n\nshowed a decreased PFS benefit on cabozantinib (HR of 0.87) and a lower response rate of 18% compared to \n\nother mutational subgroups. \n\n \n\nA significant improvement in OS was observed in the subgroup of RET M918T mutation positive patients \n\n(n=81/219 cabozantinib arm): 44.3 months in the cabozantinib arm vs. 18.9 months in the placebo arm \n\n(HR = 0.60, p = 0.0255). There was no improvement in OS for the RET M918T negative and unknown \n\nsubgroups. \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier analysis of OS among subjects with a RET M918T mutation \n\n \n\n0 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 6 0 7 2\n\n0 .0\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .8\n\n1 .0\n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\ncabozantinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant solid tumours \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means that \n\nfurther evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year \n\nand this SmPC will be updated as necessary \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral administration of cabozantinib, peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations are reached at 2 to \n\n5 hours post-dose. Plasma-concentration time profiles show a second absorption peak approximately \n\n24 hours after administration, which suggests that cabozantinib may undergo enterohepatic recirculation. \n\n \n\nRepeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in an approximately a 4- to 5-fold mean \n\ncabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state is \n\nachieved by approximately Day 15.   \n\n \n\nCometriq (n=81) \n\nPlacebo (n=45) \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n \n\nMonths \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nA high-fat meal moderately increased Cmax and AUC values (41% and 57%, respectively) relative to fasted \n\nconditions in healthy volunteers administered a single 140 mg oral cabozantinib dose. There is no \n\ninformation on the precise food-effect when taken 1 hour after administration of cabozantinib. \n\n \n\nBioequivalence could not be demonstrated between the cabozantinib capsule and tablet formulations \n\nfollowing a single 140 mg dose in healthy subjects. A 19% increase in the Cmax of the tablet formulation \n\n(CABOMETYX) compared to the capsule formulation (COMETRIQ) was observed. AUC were similar \n\nbetween cabozantinib tablet (CABOMETYX) and capsule (COMETRIQ) formulations (<10% difference). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nCabozantinib is highly protein bound in vitro in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Based on the population-\n\npharmacokinetic (PK) model, the volume of distribution (V/F) is approximately 349 L (SE: ± 2.73%). \n\nProtein binding was not altered in subjects with mild or moderately impaired renal or hepatic function. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nCabozantinib was metabolized in vivo. Four metabolites were present in plasma at exposures (AUC) greater \n\nthan 10% of parent: XL184-N-oxide, XL184 amide cleavage product, XL184 monohydroxy sulfate, and \n\n6-desmethyl amide cleavage product sulfate. Two non-conjugated metabolites (XL184-N-oxide and XL184 \n\namide cleavage product), which possess <1% of the on-target kinase inhibition potency of parent \n\ncabozantinib, each represent <10% of total drug-related plasma exposure. \n\n \n\nCabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 metabolism in vitro, as a neutralizing antibody to CYP3A4 inhibited \n\nformation of metabolite XL184 N-oxide by >80% in a NADPH-catalyzed human liver microsomal (HLM) \n\nincubation; in contrast, neutralizing antibodies to CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, \n\nCYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. A neutralizing antibody to \n\nCYP2C9 showed a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (ie, a <20% reduction). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe plasma terminal half-life of cabozantinib in single dose studies in healthy volunteers is approximately \n\n120 hours. Mean clearance (CL/F) at steady-state in cancer patients was estimated to be 4.4 L/hr in a \n\npopulation PK analysis. Within a 48-day collection period after a single dose of 14C-cabozantinib in healthy \n\nvolunteers, approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with 54% in faeces and \n\n27% in urine.  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nResults from a study in patients with renal impairment indicate that the ratios of geometric LS mean for \n\nplasma cabozantinib, Cmax and AUC0-inf were 19% and 30% higher, for subjects with mild renal impairment \n\n(90% CI for Cmax 91.60% to 155.51%; AUC0-inf 98.79% to 171.26%) and 2% and 6-7% higher (90% CI for \n\nCmax 78.64% to 133.52%; AUC0-inf 79.61% to 140.11%), for subjects with moderate renal impairment, \n\ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been \n\nstudied. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nResults from a study in patients with hepatic impairment indicate that exposure (AUC0-inf) increased by 81% \n\nand 63% in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively (90% CI for AUC0-inf: \n\n121.44% to 270.34% for mild and 107.37% to 246.67% for moderate). Patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment have not been studied. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nNo data are available to determine a difference in PK based on race. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical \n\nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nIn rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months duration, target organs for toxicity were GI tract, \n\nbone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal and reproductive tract tissues. The no observed adverse \n\neffect level (NOAEL) for these findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nCabozantinib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity assays. \n\nThe carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 transgenic mice and \n\nSprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, cabozantinib-related neoplastic findings \n\nconsisted of an increased incidence of benign pheochromocytoma, alone or in combination with malignant \n\npheochromocytoma/complex malignant pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla in both sexes at \n\nexposures well below the intended exposure in humans. The clinical relevance of the observed neoplastic \n\nlesions in rats is uncertain, but likely to be low. Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in the rasH2 mouse \n\nmodel at a slightly higher exposure than the intended human therapeutic exposure.  \n\n \n\nFertility studies in rats have shown reduced male and female fertility. Further, hypospermatogenesis was \n\nobserve in male dogs at exposure levels below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose.  \n\n \n\nEmbryo-foetal development studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats, cabozantinib caused \n\npostimplantation loss, foetal oedema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked or rudimentary tail. In \n\nrabbits, cabozantinib produced foetal soft tissue changes (reduced spleen size, small or missing intermediate \n\nlung lobe) and increased foetal incidence of total malformations. NOAEL for embryo-foetal toxicity and \n\nteratogenic findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose.   \n\n \n\nJuvenile rats (comparable to a >2 year old pediatric population) administered cabozantinib showed increased \n\nWBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female reproductive system (without \n\ndelayed vaginal opening), tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral content and density, liver pigmentation \n\nand bile duct hyperplasia. Findings in uterus/ovaries and decreased haematopoiesis appeared to be transient, \n\nwhile effects on bone parameters and liver pigmentation were sustained.

Fresh tumour samples for tumour genetic analysis from the most recent \n\nmetastatic site in patients enrolled in the dose-comparison study should be \n\ncollected. \n\nSamples will undergo thorough evaluation for RET and RAS mutations. Tumour \n\ntissue samples initially will undergo histological evaluation, manual tumour \n\nenrichment, and DNA isolation. The resulting DNA samples will be evaluated for \n\nquality by a PCR-based amplification test, and by Sanger sequencing for RET \n\nM918T. A replacement sample will be requested if an original sample fails during \n\nthe PCR quality or the Sanger sequencing tests. Next generation sequencing of \n\nRET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 will be performed, which covers the vast majority of \n\nknown RET mutations. In addition, samples will be evaluated for mutations in RAS \n\ngene hotspots (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes). \n\nPK assessments will be required for all subjects (both dose groups). Results will \n\nbe used to evaluate the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 and 140 mg dose levels \n\nand to further characterize the population PK models and exposure response \n\nrelationships of cabozantinib and possible metabolites in this population.  \n\n30 September \n\n2020  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEX III \n\n \n\nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What COMETRIQ is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat COMETRIQ is \n\nCOMETRIQ is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance cabozantinib (S)-malate.  \n\nIt is a medicine used to treat medullary thyroid cancer, a rare type of thyroid cancer, that cannot be removed \n\nby surgery or that has spread to other parts of the body.  \n\n \n\nHow COMETRIQ works \n\nCOMETRIQ blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are involved in the \n\ngrowth of cells and the development of new blood vessels that supply them. These proteins can be present in \n\nhigh amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action COMETRIQ can slow down the rate at which the \n\ntumour grows and help to cut off the blood supply that the cancer needs. \n\nCOMETRIQ may slow or stop the growth of medullary thyroid cancer. It may help shrink tumours \n\nassociated with this type of cancer. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take COMETRIQ \n\n \n\nDo not take COMETRIQ \n\n- if you are allergic to cabozantinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking COMETRIQ if you: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n-  have high blood pressure \n\n- have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear in a \nblood vessel wall. \n\n- have diarrhoea \n\n- have a recent history of coughing up blood or significant bleeding \n\n- have had surgery within the last month (or if surgical procedures are planned), including dental \n\nprocedures \n\n- have had radiotherapy in the last 3 months \n\n- have inflammatory bowel disease (for example, Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis or diverticulitis) \n\n- have been told that your cancer has spread to your airway or oesophagus \n\n- have a recent history of blood clot in the leg, stroke, or heart attack \n\n- are taking medicines to control your heart rhythm, have a slow heart rate, have problems with your \n\nheart or have problems with the levels of calcium, potassium or magnesium in your blood \n\n- have severe liver or kidney disease.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if any of these affect you. You may need treatment for them, or your doctor may decide to \n\nchange your dose of COMETRIQ, or stop treatment altogether. See also section 4 “Possible side effects”. \n\n \n\nYou should also tell your dentist that you are taking COMETRIQ. It is important for you to practice good \n\nmouth care during treatment with COMETRIQ. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nCOMETRIQ is not recommended for children or adolescents. The effects of COMETRIQ in people younger \n\nthan 18 years old are not known. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and COMETRIQ \n\n \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \n\nmedicines obtained without a prescription. This is because COMETRIQ can affect the way some other \n\nmedicines work. Also, some medicines can affect the way COMETRIQ works. This could mean that your \n\ndoctor needs to change the dose(s) that you take.  \n\n \n\n- Medicines that treat fungal infections, such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole \n- Medicines used to treat bacterial infections (antibiotics) such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and \n\nrifampicin \n\n- Allergy medicines such as fexofenadine \n- Medicines to treat angina pectoris (chest pain owing to inadequate supply to the heart) such as \n\nranolazine \n\n- Steroids used to reduce inflammation or treat a number of different diseases of the immune system \n- Medicines used to treat epilepsy or fits such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital  \n- Herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), sometimes used for \n\ntreating depression or depression-related conditions such as anxiety \n\n- Medicines used to thin the blood, such as warfarin and dabigatran etexilate \n- Medicines to treat high blood pressure or other heart conditions, such as aliskiren, ambrisentan, \n\ndigoxin, talinolol, and tolvaptan \n\n- Medicines for diabetes, such as saxagliptin and sitagliptin  \n- Medicines used to treat gout, such as colchicine \n- Medicines used to treat HIV or AIDS, such as ritonavir, maraviroc and emtricitabine \n- Medicines used to treat viral infections such as efavirenz \n- Medicines used to prevent transplant rejection (cyclosporine) and cyclosporine-based regimens in \n\nrheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis \n\n \n\nOral contraceptives \n\nIf you take COMETRIQ whilst using oral contraceptives, the oral contraceptives may be ineffective. You \n\nshould also use a barrier contraceptive (e.g. condom or diaphragm) whilst taking COMETRIQ and for at \n\nleast 4 months after treatment has finished. \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nTaking COMETRIQ with food \n\n \n\nAvoid consuming grapefruit-containing products for as long as you are using this medicine, as it may \n\nincrease the levels of COMETRIQ in your blood. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility  \n\n \n\nAvoid becoming pregnant while being treated with COMETRIQ. If you or your partner could become \n\npregnant, use adequate contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months after treatment has finished. \n\nTalk to your doctor about which methods of contraception are appropriate while you are taking COMETRIQ. \n\nSee section 2. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you or your partner become pregnant or plan to become pregnant while you are being \n\ntreated with COMETRIQ.  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor BEFORE taking COMETRIQ if you or your partner are considering or planning to \n\nhave a baby after your treatment has finished.  There is a possibility your fertility could be affected by \n\ntreatment with COMETRIQ.  \n\n \n\nWomen taking COMETRIQ should not breast feed during treatment and for at least 4 months after treatment \n\nhas finished, as cabozantinib and/or its metabolites may be excreted in breast milk and be harmful to your \n\nchild. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nUse caution when driving or using machines. Keep in mind that treatment with COMETRIQ may make you \n\nfeel tired or weak. \n\n \n\n3. How to take COMETRIQ \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nYou should continue to take this medicine until your doctor decides to stop your treatment.  If you \n\nexperience serious side effects, your doctor may decide to change your dose or stop treatment earlier than \n\noriginally planned. Your doctor will determine if you need your dose adjusted, particularly during the first \n\neight weeks of therapy with COMETRIQ. \n\n \n\nCOMETRIQ should be taken once a day.

To help you remember your doses, write the date when you took your first dose in the space next \n\nto the capsules. To remove the capsules for your dose: \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\n1. Push in tab \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Peel paper backing \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Push capsule through foil \n \n\n \n\n \n\nCOMETRIQ should not be taken with food. You should not eat anything for at least 2 hours before taking \n\nCOMETRIQ and for 1 hour after taking the medicine. Swallow the capsules one at a time with water. Do not \n\nopen them. \n\n \n\nIf you take more COMETRIQ than you should \n\nIf you have taken more COMETRIQ than you have been instructed to, talk to a doctor or go to the hospital \n\nwith the capsules and this leaflet straight away. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take COMETRIQ \n\n- If there are still 12 hours or more before your next dose is due then take the missed dose as soon as \n\nyou remember. Take the next dose at the normal time. \n\n- If your next dose is due in less than 12 hours then do not take the dose that you have missed. Take \n\nyour next dose at the normal time.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. If you get side \n\neffects, your doctor may tell you to take COMETRIQ at a lower dose. Your doctor may also prescribe other \n\nmedicines to help control your side effects. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following side effects – you may need urgent \n\nmedical treatment: \n\n• Symptoms including pain in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or fever. These may be \nsigns of a gastrointestinal perforation, a hole that develops in your stomach or intestine that could be \n\nlife-threatening. \n\n• Swelling, pain in your hands and feet, or shortness of breath. \n\n• A wound that does not heal.  \n\n• Vomiting or coughing up blood, which may be bright red or look like coffee grounds. \n\n• Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, numbness or a feeling of \nheaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth.
