This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRefixia 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nRefixia 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nRefixia 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nRefixia 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 500 IU nonacog beta pegol*. \nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml of Refixia contains approximately 125 IU nonacog beta pegol. \n \nRefixia 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 1000 IU nonacog beta pegol*. \nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml of Refixia contains approximately 250 IU nonacog beta pegol. \n \nRefixia 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 2000 IU nonacog beta pegol*. \nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml of Refixia contains approximately 500 IU nonacog beta pegol. \n \n*recombinant human factor IX, produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant \nDNA technology, covalently conjugated to a 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG). \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopeia one-stage clotting \ntest. The specific activity of Refixia is approximately 152 IU/mg protein. \n \nRefixia is a purified recombinant human factor IX (rFIX) with a 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) \nselectively attached to specific N-linked glycans in the rFIX activation peptide. Upon activation of \nRefixia, the activation peptide including the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol moiety is cleaved off, leaving \nthe native activated factor IX molecule. The primary amino acid sequence of the rFIX in Refixia is \nidentical to the Ala148 allelic form of human plasma-derived factor IX. No additives of human or \nanimal origin are used in the cell culture, purification, conjugation, or formulation of Refixia. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nLess than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nThe powder is white to off-white. \n \nThe solvent is clear and colourless. \n \npH: 6.4. \n \nOsmolality: 272 mOsmol/kg. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia B (congenital \nfactor IX deficiency). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n \nPreviously untreated patients \nThe safety and efficacy of Refixia in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. \n \nTreatment monitoring \nRoutine monitoring of factor IX activity levels for the purpose of dose adjustment is not necessary. In \nthe clinical trial programme, dose adjustment was not performed. Mean steady state factor IX trough \nlevels above 15% were observed for all age groups, see section 5.2 for details. \n \nDue to the interference of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the one-stage clotting assay with various aPTT \nreagents, it is recommended to use a chromogenic assay (e.g. Rox Factor IX or Biophen) when \nmonitoring is needed. If a chromogenic assay is not available, it is recommended to use a one-stage \nclotting assay with an aPTT reagent (e.g. Cephascreen) qualified for use with Refixia. For modified \nlong-acting factor products it is known that the one-stage clotting assay results are highly dependent \non the aPTT reagent and reference standard used. For Refixia some reagents will cause \nunderestimation (30\u201350%), while most silica containing reagents will cause severe overestimation of \nthe factor IX activity (more than 400%). Therefore, silica based reagents should be avoided. Use of a \nreference laboratory is recommended when a chromogenic assay or a qualified one-stage clotting \nassay is not available locally. \n \nPosology \nThe number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \nrelated to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed \neither as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an \nInternational Standard for factor IX in plasma). \n \nProphylaxis \n40 IU/kg body weight once weekly. \nAdjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FIX levels \nand individual bleeding tendency. The trough levels achieved with the weekly 40 IU/kg dosing \nregimen are summarised in section 5.2. \n \nPatients on prophylaxis who forget a dose are advised to take their dose upon discovery and thereafter \ncontinue with the usual once weekly dosing schedule. A double dose should be avoided. \n \nOn-demand treatment \nDose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the location and severity of the bleeding, see \nTable 1 for dosing guidance in bleeding episodes. \n \nTable 1 Treatment of bleeding episodes with Refixia \n\nDegree of \nhaemorrhage \n\nRecommended \ndose IU/kg of \nRefixia \n\nDosing recommendations \n\n\n\n4 \n\nEarly \nhaemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or \noral bleeding. \n \nMore extensive \nhaemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or \nhaematoma. \n\n40 A single dose is recommended. \n\nSevere or life \nthreatening \nhaemorrhages. \n\n80 Additional doses of 40 IU/kg can be \ngiven. \n\n \nSurgery \nThe dose level and dosing intervals for surgery depend on the procedure and local practice. General \nrecommendations are provided in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 Treatment in surgery with Refixia \n\nType of surgical \nprocedure \n\nRecommended \ndose IU/kg body \nweight \n\nDosing recommendations \n\nMinor surgery \nincluding tooth \nextraction. \n\n40 Additional doses can be given if needed.  \n\nMajor surgery. 80 Pre-operative dose. \n\n40 Consider two repeated doses of 40 IU/kg \n(in 1\u20133 day intervals) within the first \nweek after surgery. \n \nDue to the long half-life of Refixia, the \nfrequency of dosing in the post-surgical \nperiod may be extended to once weekly \nafter the first week until bleeding stops \nand healing is achieved. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe dose recommendations in adolescents (12\u201318 years) are the same as for adults: 40 IU/kg body \nweight. The long-term safety of Refixia in children below 12 years has not yet been established. \n \nMethod of administration \nIntravenous use. \n \nRefixia is administered by intravenous bolus injection over several minutes after reconstitution of the \npowder for injection with the histidine solvent. The rate of administration should be determined by the \npatient\u2019s comfort level up to a maximum injection rate of 4 ml/min. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nIn case of self-administration or administration by caregiver appropriate training is needed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nKnown allergic reaction to hamster protein. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Refixia. The product contains traces of \nhamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use \nof the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the \nearly signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, \nwheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nAfter repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products, patients should be \nmonitored for the development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in \nBethesda Units (BU) using appropriate biological testing. \n \nThere have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX \ninhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated \nfor the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an \nincreased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX. \n \nBecause of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX products, the initial administrations of factor IX \nshould, according to the treating physician\u2019s judgement, be performed under medical observation \nwhere proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided. \n \nIn case of residual FIX activity levels, there is a risk of interference when performing the Nijmegen \nmodified Bethesda assay for inhibitor testing. Therefore a pre-heating step or a wash-out is \nrecommended in order to ensure detection of low-titre inhibitors. \n \nThromboembolism \nBecause of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of \nthrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when \nadministering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born \ninfants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the benefit \nof treatment with Refixia should be weighed against the risk of these complications. \n \nCardiovascular event \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nPaediatric population \nRefixia is not indicated for use in children (below 12 years). The listed warnings and precautions apply \nboth to adults and adolescents (12\u201318 years). \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. it is essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nRecord of use \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Refixia is administered to a patient, the name and \nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \nof the medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have \nbeen reported. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX. Based on the rare occurrence of \nhaemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and \nbreastfeeding is not available. Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and lactation only \nif clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRefixia has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely with recombinant factor IX products and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis \n(including shock). In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have \noccurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitors (see also section 4.4). \nNephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in \nhaemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction. \n \nVery rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has \nbeen observed. \n \nPatients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such \ninhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it \nis recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre is contacted. \n \nThere is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX \nproducts, with a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has \nbeen associated with instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, \nvenous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX products like Refixia is \nrarely associated with such adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nA total of 115 previously treated male patients with moderate or severe haemophilia B have been \nexposed to Refixia for a total of 170 patient years in the completed clinical trials. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nTable 3 Frequency of adverse reactions in clinical trials \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity \nAnaphylaxis \nInhibitors \n\nUncommon \nUnknown \nUnknown \n\nCardiac disorders Palpitations Uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nPruritus* Common \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nFatigue \nHot flush \nInjection site reactions** \n\nCommon \nUncommon \nCommon \n\n*Pruritus includes the terms pruritus and ear pruritus \n**Injection site reactions include injection site pain, infusion site pain, injection site swelling, injection site erythema and \ninjection site rash. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nIn an ongoing trial in previously untreated patients, anaphylaxis has occurred in close temporal \nassociation with development of factor IX inhibitors following treatment with Refixia. There are \ninsufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in previously untreated patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nRefixia is indicated for patients 12 years and above. No difference in the safety profile of Refixia was \nobserved between previously treated adolescent (12\u201318 years) and adult patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdoses up to 169 IU/kg have been reported in clinical trials. No symptoms associated with \noverdoses have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX, ATC code: B02BD04. \n \nMechanism of action \nRefixia is a purified recombinant human factor IX (rFIX) with a 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) \nconjugated to the protein. The average molecular weight of Refixia is approximately 98 kDa and the \nmolecular weight of the protein moiety alone is 56 kDa. Upon activation of Refixia, the activation \npeptide including the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol moiety is cleaved off, leaving the native activated \nfactor IX molecule. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nFactor IX is a single chain glycoprotein. It is a vitamin-K dependent coagulation factor and it is \nsynthesised in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa and by factor VII/tissue factor complex. \nActivated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated factor X \nconverts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot is \nformed. Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased \nlevels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles, or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels \nof factor IX are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and \ncorrection of the bleeding tendencies. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe completed clinical trial programme included one phase 1 trial and four phase 3 multicentre, non-\ncontrolled trials. \n \nProphylaxis \nFifty-four of the patients across all age-groups were treated with a weekly prophylactic dose of \n40 IU/kg where 23 (43%) of these patients had no bleeding episodes. \n \nPivotal trial \nThe pivotal trial included 74 adolescent (13\u201317 years) and adult (18\u201365 years) previously treated \npatients. The trial included one open-label on-demand arm with treatment for approximately 28 weeks \nand two prophylaxis treatment arms with single-blind randomisation to either 10 IU/kg or 40 IU/kg \nonce-weekly for approximately 52 weeks. When comparing the 10 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg treatments, the \nannualised bleeding rate for patients in the 40 IU/kg arm was found to be 49% lower than the bleeding \nrate (95% CI: 5%;73%) for patients in the 10 IU/kg arm (p<0.05). \n \nThe median (IQR) overall annual bleeding rate (ABR) in patients (13\u201365 years) treated with a \nprophylactic dose of 40 IU/kg once weekly was 1.04 (0.00; 4.01) whereas the traumatic ABR was 0.00 \n(0.00; 2.05), joint ABR was 0.97 (0.00; 2.07) and spontaneous ABR was 0.00 (0.00; 0.99). \nOf note, ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical \nstudies. \n \nIn this pivotal trial in adolescent and adult patients, there were 70 breakthrough bleeding episodes for \n16 out of 29 patients in the 40 IU/kg prophylaxis arm. The overall success rate for treatment of \nbreakthrough bleeds was 97.1% (67 out of 69 evaluated bleeds). A total of 69 (98.6%) of the 70 \nbleeding episodes were treated with one injection. Bleeding episodes were treated with Refixia at \n40 IU/kg for mild or moderate bleeds. \n \nIn 29 adult and adolescent patients treated, 13 patients with 20 target joints were treated for one year \nwith a weekly prophylactic dose of 40 IU/kg. Eighteen out of these 20 joints (90%) were no longer \nconsidered target joints at the end of the trial. \n \nOn-demand treatment \nIn the pivotal trial there was a non-randomised arm where 15 patients were treated in an on-demand \nregimen with 40 IU/kg for mild or moderate bleeds and 80 IU/kg for severe bleeds. The overall \nsuccess rate (defined as excellent or good) for treatment of bleeds was 95% with 98% of the bleeds \ntreated with one or two injections. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe use of Refixia in children below 12 years is not indicated (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \nA trial including 25 paediatric previously treated patients (ages 0\u201312 years) who received a \nprophylactic dose 40 IU/kg once weekly was performed. \nIn children aged 0\u201312 years, the median (IQR) annualised bleeding rate was 1.0 (0.00; 2.06) and the \nspontaneous bleeding rate was 0.00 (0.00; 0.00). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nFor treatment of bleeds in paediatrics, the overall success rate (defined as excellent or good) was 93% \n(39 out of 42 bleeds), where 36 (86 %) of the bleeds were resolved with 1 injection, and 5 (12%) of the \nbleeds were resolved with 2 injections of Refixia. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the completion of the study with Refixia in previously \nuntreated patients (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nOverall haemostatic efficacy \nBleeding episodes were treated with Refixia at 40 IU/kg for mild or moderate bleeds or 80 IU/kg for \nsevere bleeds, where one bleed was evaluated as severe. An overall assessment of haemostatic efficacy \nwas performed by the patient or caretaker (for home treatment) or study site investigator (for treatment \nunder health care professional supervision) using a 4-point scale of excellent, good, moderate, or poor. \nThe overall success rate (defined as excellent or good) for treatment of bleeds was 93% (551 out of \n591). Of the 597 treated bleeds observed in 79 (75%) of the 105 patients, 521 (87%) of the bleeds were \nresolved with 1 injection and 60 (10%) of the bleeds were resolved with 2 injections of Refixia. \n \nThe success rate and dose needed for treatment of the bleeding episodes were independent of the \nlocalisation of the bleed. The success rate for treatment of bleeding episodes was also independent of \nwhether the bleed was traumatic or spontaneous of nature. \n \nSurgery \nThree trials of which one trial was a dedicated surgery trial included in total 15 major and 26 minor \nsurgery procedures (patients aged 13 to 56 years). Haemostatic effect of Refixia during surgery was \nconfirmed with a success rate of 100% in the 15 major surgeries in the trials. All evaluated minor \nsurgeries were performed successfully. \n \nIn a dedicated surgery trial, the efficacy analysis included 13 major surgical procedures performed in \n13 previously treated adult and adolescent patients. The procedures included 9 orthopaedic, 1 \ngastrointestinal, and 3 surgeries in the oral cavity. The patients received 1 pre-operative injection of \n80 IU/kg on the day of surgery, and post-operatively, injections of 40 IU/kg. A pre-operative dose of \n80 IU/kg Refixia was effective and no patients required additional doses on the day of surgery. In the \npost-surgery period Day 1 to 6 and Day 7 to 13, the median number of additional 40 IU/kg doses \nadministered was 2.0 and 1.5, respectively. The mean total consumption of Refixia during and after \nsurgery was 241 IU/kg (range: 81\u2013460 IU/kg). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nRefixia has a prolonged half-life compared to unmodified factor IX. All pharmacokinetic studies with \nRefixia were conducted in previously treated patients with haemophilia B (factor IX \u22642%). The \nanalysis of plasma samples was conducted using the one-stage clotting assay. \n \nSteady state pharmacokinetic parameters for adolescents and adults are shown in Table 4 \n \nTable 4 Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of Refixia (40 IU/kg) in adolescents and \n\nadults (geometric mean (CV%)) \nPK Parameter 13\u201317 years  \n\nN=3 \n\u226518 years  \nN=6 \n\nHalf-life (t1/2) (hours) 103 (14) 115 (10) \n\nIncremental Recovery (IR) (IU/ml per \nIU/kg) \n\n0.018 (28) 0.019 (20) \n\nArea under the curve (AUC)0-168h \n(IU*hours/ml) \n\n91 (22) 93 (15) \n\nClearance (CL) (ml/hour/kg) 0.4 (17) 0.4 (11) \n\nMean residence time (MRT) (hours) 144 (15) 158 (10) \n\n\n\n10 \n\nVolume of distribution (Vss) (ml/kg) 61 (31) 66 (12) \n\nFactor IX activity 168 h post dosing \n(IU/ml) \n\n0.29 (19) 0.32 (17) \n\nClearance = body weight adjusted clearance; Incremental recovery = incremental recovery 30 min post dosing, Volume of \ndistribution = body weight adjusted volume of distribution at steady state.

No dose adjustment was required for paediatric or adolescent patients in clinical \ntrials. \n \nThe mean trough levels at steady state are presented in Table 6; based on all pre-dose measurements \ntaken every 8 weeks at steady state for all patients on once weekly dosing of 40 IU/kg. The use of \nRefixia in children below 12 years is not indicated. \n \nTable 6 Mean of trough levels* of Refixia (40 IU/kg) at steady state \n\n 0\u20136 years 7\u201312 years 13\u201317 years 18\u201365 years \n\n\n\n11 \n\nN=12 N=13 N=9 N=20 \n\nEstimated mean \nfactor IX trough \nlevels IU/ml  \n(95% CI) \n\n0.15 \n(0.13;0.18) \n\n0.19 \n(0.16;0.22) \n\n0.24 \n(0.20;0.28) \n\n0.29 \n(0.26;0.33) \n\n* Factor IX trough levels = factor IX activity measured prior to next weekly dose (5 to 10 days post dosing) at steady state. \n \nPharmacokinetics were investigated in 16 adult and adolescent patients of which 6 were normal weight \n(BMI 18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2) and 10 were overweight (BMI 25\u201329.9 kg/m2). There were no apparent \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetic profiles between normal weight and overweight patients.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn a repeat dose toxicity study in monkeys, mild and transient body tremors were seen 3 hours post \ndosing and abated within 1 hour. These body tremors were seen at doses of Refixia (3,750 IU/kg), \nwhich were more than 90 times higher than the recommended dose for humans (40 IU/kg). No \nmechanism behind the tremors was identified. Tremors have not been reported in the clinical trials. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no concern for humans based on conventional safety pharmacology and \nrepeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. \n \nIn repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) was detected \nby immunohistochemical staining in epithelial cells of choroid plexus in the brain. This finding was \nnot associated with tissue damage or abnormal clinical signs. \n \nIn distribution and excretion studies in mice and rats, the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) moiety of \nRefixia was shown to be widely distributed to and eliminated from organs, and excreted via plasma in \nurine (44\u201356%) and faeces (28\u201350%). Based on modelled data using observed terminal half-lives (15\u2013\n49 days) in rat tissue distribution studies, the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) moiety will reach \nsteady state levels in all human tissues within 1\u20132 years of treatment. \n \nLong-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Refixia, or studies to determine \nthe effects of Refixia on genotoxicity, fertility, development, or reproduction have not been performed. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Refixia is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Refixia \n3. How to use Refixia \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Refixia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Refixia is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Refixia is \nRefixia contains the active substance nonacog beta pegol and is a long-acting recombinant coagulation \nfactor IX product. Factor IX is a protein naturally found in the blood that helps to stop bleeding. \n \nWhat Refixia is used for \nRefixia is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia B \n(inborn factor IX deficiency). \n \nIn patients with haemophilia B, factor IX is missing or does not work properly. Refixia replaces this \nfaulty or missing factor IX and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding. When you bleed, \nRefixia is activated in the blood to form factor IX. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Refixia \n \nDo not use Refixia: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6). \n\u2022 if you are allergic to hamster proteins. \n \nIf you are not sure if either of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nAllergic reactions and development of inhibitors \nThere is a rare risk that you may experience a sudden and severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylactic \nreaction) to Refixia. Stop the injection and contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if \nyou have signs of an allergic reaction such as rash, hives, weals, itching on large areas of skin, redness \nand/or swelling of lips, tongue, face or hands, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, shortness of \nbreath, wheezing, tightness of the chest, pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, and/or dizziness. \n \nYour doctor may need to treat you promptly for these reactions. Your doctor may also do a blood test \nto check if you have developed factor IX inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) against your medicine, as \ninhibitors may develop together with allergic reactions. If you have such antibodies, you may be at an \nincreased risk of sudden and severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) during future \ntreatment with factor IX. \n \nBecause of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, your initial treatment with Refixia should be \ngiven in a medical clinic or in the presence of health care professionals where proper medical care for \nallergic reactions can be provided if needed. \n \nTalk to your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected or if you have to \nsignificantly increase your usage of Refixia in order to stop a bleed. Your doctor will do a blood test to \ncheck if you have developed inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) against Refixia. The risk for \ndeveloping inhibitors is highest if you have not been treated with factor IX medicines before i.e. for \nsmall children. \n \nBlood clots \nTell your doctor, if any of the following apply to you as there is an increased risk of blood clots during \ntreatment with Refixia: \n\u2022 you have recently had surgery \n\u2022 you suffer from other serious illness e.g. liver disease, heart disease, or cancer \n\u2022 you have risk factors for heart disease e.g high blood pressure, obesity, or smoking. \n \nKidney disorder (nephrotic syndrome) \nThere is a rare risk of developing a specific kidney disorder called \u201cnephrotic syndrome\u201d following \nhigh doses of factor IX in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic \nreactions. \n \nCatheter-related problems \nIf you have a central venous access device (CVAD), you may develop infections or blood clots at the \nsite of the catheter. \n \nOther medicines and Refixia \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using Refixia. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRefixia has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nRefixia contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. it is essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use Refixia \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nTreatment with Refixia will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia B. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor \nif you are not sure about how to use Refixia. \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose for you. The dose will depend on your weight and what the \nmedicine is being used for. \n \nPrevention of bleeding \nThe dose of Refixia is 40 international units (IU) per kg of body weight. This is given as one injection \nevery week. Your doctor may choose another dose or how often the injections should be given, based \non your need. \n \nTreatment of bleeding \nThe dose of Refixia is 40 international units (IU) per kg of body weight. Depending on the location \nand the severity of bleeding you may need a higher dose (80 IU per kg) or extra injections. Discuss \nwith your doctor the dose and number of injections you need. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nRefixia can be used only in adolescents (12 years and above). The dose in adolescents is also \ncalculated according to body weight and is the same dose as for adults. \n \nHow Refixia is given \nRefixia is given as an injection into a vein. See \u201cInstructions on how to use Refixia\u201d for more \ninformation. \n \nIf you use more Refixia than you should \nIf you use more Refixia than you should, contact your doctor. \n \nIf you have to significantly increase your usage of Refixia to stop a bleed, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. For further information, see section 2 \u201cAllergic reactions and development of inhibitors\u201d. \n \nIf you forget to use Refixia \nIf you forget a dose, inject the missed dose as soon as you remember. Do not inject a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. If you are in doubt contact your doctor. \n \nIf you stop using Refixia \nIf you stop using Refixia you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not \nstop. Do not stop using Refixia without talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions are possible with this medicine. \nIf sudden and severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reactions) occur, the injection must be \nstopped immediately. You must contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if you have \nearly signs of an allergic reaction such as: \n\u2022 difficulty in swallowing or breathing \n\u2022 shortness of breath or wheezing \n\u2022 chest tightness \n\u2022 redness and/or swelling of the lips, tongue, face or hands \n\u2022 rash, hives, weals or itching \n\u2022 pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, and/or dizziness (low blood pressure). \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nThe following side effects have been observed with Refixia: \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 itching (pruritus) \n\u2022 skin reactions at the site of injection \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 feeling very tired. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 allergic reactions (hypersensitivity). This may become severe and could be life-threatening \n\n(anaphylactic reactions) \n\u2022 heart palpitations \n\u2022 hot flush. \n \nSide effects with unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 neutralising antibodies (inhibitors). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Refixia \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use Refixia after the expiry date which is stated after \u201cEXP\u201d on the carton and on the vial and \nthe pre-filled syringe labels. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Store in the original package in order to protect \nfrom light. \n \nRefixia may be taken out of the refrigerator for a maximum period of 6 months and stored at room \ntemperature (up to 30\u00b0C). Please record on the carton the date Refixia is removed from the refrigerator \nand placed at room temperature. This new expiry date should never exceed the one initially mentioned \non the outer carton. If the medicine has not been used before the new expiry date, it should be disposed \nof. After storage at room temperature the medicine must not be put back in the refrigerator. \n \nUse the injection immediately after reconstitution. If it cannot be used immediately, use within \n24 hours if stored in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C or within 4 hours if stored out of the refrigerator at a \nmaximum temperature of 30\u00b0C. \n \nThe powder in the vial appears as a white to off-white powder. Do not use the powder if the colour has \nchanged. \n \nThe reconstituted solution will be clear and colourless. Do not use the reconstituted solution if you \nnotice any particles or discolouration. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Refixia contains \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n34 \n\n\u2022 The active substance is nonacog beta pegol (pegylated human coagulation factor IX (rDNA)). \nEach vial of Refixia contains nominally 500 IU, 1000 IU or 2000 IU nonacog beta pegol \ncorresponding to approximately 125 IU/ml, 250 IU/ml or 500 IU/ml respectively after \nreconstitution with histidine solvent. \n\n\u2022 The other ingredients in the powder are sodium chloride, histidine, sucrose, polysorbate 80, \nmannitol, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. \n\n\u2022 The ingredients in the sterilised solvent are histidine, water for injections, sodium hydroxide and \nhydrochloric acid. \n\n \nWhat Refixia looks like and contents of the pack \n\u2022 Refixia is provided as a powder and solvent for solution for injection (500 IU, 1000 IU or \n\n2000 IU powder in a vial and 4 ml solvent in a pre-filled syringe, a plunger rod with a vial \nadapter \u2013 pack size of 1). \n\n\u2022 The powder is white to off-white and the solvent is clear and colourless. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nNovo Nordisk A/S \nNovo All\u00e9 \nDK-2880 Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark \n \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in \n \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nInstructions on how to use Refixia \n \nRead these instructions carefully before using Refixia. \n \nRefixia is supplied as a powder. Before injection it must be reconstituted with the solvent supplied in \nthe syringe. The solvent is a histidine solution. The reconstituted product must be injected into your \nvein (intravenous (IV) injection). The equipment in this package is designed to reconstitute and inject \nRefixia. \n \nYou will also need an infusion set (tubing and butterfly needle), sterile alcohol swabs, gauze pads and \nplasters. These items are not included in the Refixia package. \n \nDo not use the equipment without proper training from your doctor or nurse. \n \nAlways wash your hands and ensure that the area around you is clean. \n \nWhen you prepare and inject medicine directly into the veins, it is important to use a clean and germ \nfree (aseptic) technique. Incorrect technique can introduce germs that can infect the blood. \n \nDo not open the equipment until you are ready to use it. \n \nDo not use the equipment if it has been dropped, or if it is damaged. Use a new package instead. \n \nDo not use the equipment if it has expired. Use a new package instead. The expiry date is printed on \nthe outer carton, on the vial, on the vial adapter, and on the pre-filled syringe. \n \nDo not use the equipment if you suspect it is contaminated. Use a new package instead. \n \nDo not dispose of any of the items until after you have injected the reconstituted solution. \n \nThe equipment is for single use only. \n\nContents \nThe package contains: \n\u2022 1 vial with Refixia powder \n\u2022 1 vial adapter \n\u2022 1 pre-filled syringe with solvent \n\u2022 1 plunger rod (placed under the syringe) \n \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nVial with Refixia powder \n\nPlastic cap \nRubber stopper \n\n(under plastic cap) \n\nOverview \n\n  \n \n\nVial adapter \n\nProtective cap \n\nSpike \n(under protective paper) \n\nProtective \npaper \n\n \n \n\nPre-filled syringe with solvent \n\nSyringe tip \n(under syringe cap) Scale \n\nPlunger \n\nSyringe cap \n\n \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nPlunger rod \n\nThread Wide top \nend \n\n \n\n1. Prepare the vial and the syringe \n \n\u2022 Take out the number of Refixia packages \n\nyou need. \n \n\n\u2022 Check the expiry date. \n \n\n\u2022 Check the name, strength and colour of \nthe package, to make sure it contains the \ncorrect product. \n\n \n\u2022 Wash your hands and dry them properly \n\nusing a clean towel or air dry. \n \n\n\u2022 Take the vial, the vial adapter and the pre-\nfilled syringe out of the carton. Leave the \nplunger rod untouched in the carton. \n\n \n\u2022 Bring the vial and the pre-filled syringe \n\nto room temperature. You can do this by \nholding them in your hands until they feel \nas warm as your hands. \n\n \n\u2022 Do not use any other way to warm the \n\nvial and pre-filled syringe. \n\n A \n\n \n\n\u2022 Remove the plastic cap from the vial. If \nthe plastic cap is loose or missing, do not \nuse the vial. \n\n \n\u2022 Wipe the rubber stopper with a sterile \n\nalcohol swab and allow it to air dry for a \nfew seconds before use to ensure that it is \nas germ free as possible. \n\n \n\u2022 Do not touch the rubber stopper with \n\nyour fingers as this can transfer germs. \n\n B \n\n \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n2. Attach the vial adapter \n \n\u2022 Remove the protective paper from the \n\nvial adapter. \n \n\nIf the protective paper is not fully sealed \nor if it is broken, do not use the vial \nadapter. \n \nDo not take the vial adapter out of the \nprotective cap with your fingers. \nIf you touch the spike on the vial adapter, \ngerms from your fingers can be transferred. \n\n C \n\n \n\n\u2022 Place the vial on a flat and solid surface. \n \n\u2022 Turn over the protective cap, and snap \n\nthe vial adapter onto the vial. \n \n\nOnce attached, do not remove the vial \nadapter from the vial. \n\n D \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 Lightly squeeze the protective cap with \nyour thumb and index finger as shown. \n\n \nRemove the protective cap from the vial \nadapter. \n \nDo not lift the vial adapter from the vial \nwhen removing the protective cap. \n\n E \n\n \n\n3. Attach the plunger rod and the syringe \n \n\u2022 Grasp the plunger rod by the wide top end \n\nand take it out of the carton. Do not touch \nthe sides or the thread of the plunger \nrod. If you touch the sides or the thread, \ngerms from your fingers can be transferred. \n\n \n\u2022 Immediately connect the plunger rod to \n\nthe syringe by turning it clockwise into the \nplunger inside the pre-filled syringe until \nresistance is felt. \n\n \n\n F \n\n \n\n\u2022 Remove the syringe cap from the \npre-filled syringe by bending it down until \nthe perforation breaks. \n\n \n\u2022 Do not touch the syringe tip under the \n\nsyringe cap. If you touch the syringe tip, \ngerms from your fingers can be transferred. \n\n \nIf the syringe cap is loose or missing, do \n\n G \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nnot use the pre-filled syringe. \n\n\u2022 Screw the pre-filled syringe securely onto \nthe vial adapter until resistance is felt. \n\n H \n\n \n\n4. Reconstitute the powder with the solvent \n \n\u2022 Hold the pre-filled syringe slightly tilted \n\nwith the vial pointing downwards. \n \n\u2022 Push the plunger rod to inject all the \n\nsolvent into the vial. \n\n I \n\n \n\n\u2022 Keep the plunger rod pressed down and \nswirl the vial gently until all the powder is \ndissolved. \n\n \nDo not shake the vial as this will cause \nfoaming. \n\n \n\u2022 Check the reconstituted solution. It must \n\nbe clear and colourless and no particles \nshould be visible. If you notice particles \nor discolouration, do not use it. Use a \nnew package instead. \n\n J \n\n \n\nRefixia is recommended to be used immediately after it has been reconstituted. This is because if \nleft, the medicine may no longer be sterile and could cause infections. \n \nIf you cannot use the reconstituted Refixia solution immediately, it should be used within 4 hours \nwhen stored at room temperature (up to 30\u00b0C) and within 24 hours when stored in a refrigerator \n(2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). Store the reconstituted product in the vial. \n \nDo not freeze reconstituted Refixia solution or store it in syringes. \n \nKeep reconstituted Refixia solution out of direct light. \n \n\n \nIf your dose requires more than one vial, repeat steps A to J with additional vials, vial adapters and \npre-filled syringes until you have reached your required dose. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n\u2022 Keep the plunger rod pushed completely \nin. \n\n \n\u2022 Turn the syringe with the vial upside \n\ndown. \n \n\n\u2022 Stop pushing the plunger rod and let it \nmove back on its own while the \nreconstituted solution fills the syringe. \n\n \n\u2022 Pull the plunger rod slightly downwards \n\nto draw the reconstituted solution into the \nsyringe. \n\n \n\u2022 In case you only need part of the entire \n\nvial, use the scale on the syringe to see \nhow much reconstituted solution you \nwithdraw, as instructed by your doctor \nor nurse. \n\n \nIf, at any point, there is air in the syringe, \ninject the air back into the vial. \n\n \n\u2022 While holding the vial upside down, tap \n\nthe syringe gently to let any air bubbles \nrise to the top. \n\n \n\u2022 Push the plunger rod slowly until all air \n\nbubbles are gone. \n\n K \n\n \n\n\u2022 Unscrew the vial adapter with the vial. \n \n\u2022 Do not touch the syringe tip. If you touch \n\nthe syringe tip, germs from your fingers \ncan be transferred. \n\n L \n\n \n\n5. Inject the reconstituted solution \n \nRefixia is now ready to inject into your vein. \n\u2022 Inject the reconstituted solution as instructed by your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 Inject slowly over 1 to 3 minutes. \n\u2022 Do not mix Refixia with any other intravenous infusions or medications. \n \nInjecting Refixia via needleless connectors for intravenous (IV) catheters \n \nCaution: The pre-filled syringe is made of glass and is designed to be compatible with standard luer-\nlock connections. Some needleless connectors with an internal spike are incompatible with the \npre-filled syringe. This incompatibility may prevent administration of the drug and/or result in damage \nto the needleless connector. \n \nInjecting the solution via a central venous access device (CVAD) such as a central venous catheter or \na subcutaneous port: \n\u2022 Use a clean and germ free (aseptic) technique. Follow the instructions for proper use for your \n\nconnector and CVAD in consultation with your doctor or nurse. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n\u2022 Injecting into a CVAD may require using a sterile 10 ml plastic syringe for withdrawal of the \nreconstituted solution. This should be done right after step J. \n\n\u2022 If the CVAD line needs to be flushed before or after Refixia injection, use sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml solution for injection. \n\nDisposal \n \n\u2022 After injection, safely dispose of all \n\nunused Refixia solution, the syringe with \nthe infusion set, the vial with the vial \nadapter and other waste materials as \ninstructed by your pharmacist. \n\n \nDo not throw it out with the ordinary \nhousehold waste.  \n\n M \n\n \n\nDo not disassemble the equipment before disposal. \n \nDo not reuse the equipment. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

anaphylactic reaction) to refixia. stop the injection and contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if you have signs of an allergic reaction such as rash, hives, weals, itching on large areas of skin, redness and/or swelling of lips, tongue, face or hands, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness of the chest, pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, and/or dizziness. your doctor may need to treat you promptly for these reactions. your doctor may also do a blood test to check if you have developed factor ix inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) against your medicine, as inhibitors may develop together with allergic reactions. if you have such antibodies, you may be at an increased risk of sudden and severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) during future treatment with factor ix. because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor ix, your initial treatment with refixia should be given in a medical clinic or in the presence of health care professionals where proper medical care for allergic reactions can be provided if needed. talk to your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected or if you have to significantly increase your usage of refixia in order to stop a bleed. your doctor will do a blood test to check if you have developed inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) against refixia. the risk for developing inhibitors is highest if you have not been treated with factor ix medicines before i.e. for small children. blood clots tell your doctor, if any of the following apply to you as there is an increased risk of blood clots during treatment with refixia: you have recently had surgery you suffer from other serious illness e.g. liver disease, heart disease, or cancer you have risk factors for heart disease e.g high blood pressure, obesity, or smoking. kidney disorder (nephrotic syndrome) there is a rare risk of developing a specific kidney disorder called \"nephrotic syndrome\" following high doses of factor ix in haemophilia b patients with factor ix inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions. catheter-related problems if you have a central venous access device (cvad), you may develop infections or blood clots at the site of the catheter. other medicines and refixia tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using refixia. driving and
