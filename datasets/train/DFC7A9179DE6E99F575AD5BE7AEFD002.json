NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nDUTREBIS 150 mg/300 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of raltegravir (as potassium).\n\nExcipient with known effect: Each tablet contains 39.70 mg lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet.\n\nGreen, oval tablet, marked with \"144\" on one side. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nDUTREBIS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment \nof human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults, adolescents, and children from the age \nof 6 years and weighing at least 30 kg without present or past evidence of viral resistance to antiviral \nagents of the InSTI (Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor) and NRTI (Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase \nInhibitor) classes (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\nDUTREBIS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapy (ART) (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nAdults, adolescents, and children (6 through 11 years of age weighing at least 30 kg)\nThe recommended dosage is one tablet (150 mg lamivudine/300 mg raltegravir) twice daily.\n\nRaltegravir is also available in a chewable tablet formulation for children weighing at least 11 kg and \nin granules for oral suspension formulation for infants and toddlers from 4 weeks of age and weighing \nat least 3 kg to less than 20 kg. Refer to the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs \nfor additional dosing information.\n\nLamivudine is also available as an oral solution for children over three months of age and who weigh \nless than 14 kg or for patients who are unable to swallow tablets.\n\nThe maximum dose is one tablet twice daily.\n\nAdvice on missed doses\nIf DUTREBIS is missed within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to \ntake the prescribed dose of DUTREBIS as soon as possible. If this is noticed later than 6 hours of the \ntime it is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should resume the usual \ndosing schedule.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information regarding the use of lamivudine and raltegravir in the elderly (see \nsection 5.2). Therefore DUTREBIS should be used with caution in this population. Because \nlamivudine is substantially excreted by the kidney and older people are more likely to have decreased \nrenal function, renal function should be monitored. A reduction in renal function may necessitate \nswitching DUTREBIS to a regimen of the individual components (lamivudine and raltegravir). Please \nrefer to the SmPC for the individual components of DUTREBIS for dosing instructions.\n\nRenal impairment\nDUTREBIS should not be given in patients with a creatinine clearance of <50 ml/min. Renal function \nshould be monitored in patients more likely to have decreased renal function. If creatinine clearance \ndecreases to <50 ml/min, DUTREBIS should be switched to a regimen of the individual components \n(lamivudine and raltegravir). Please refer to the SmPC for the individual components of DUTREBIS\nfor dosing instructions. Because the extent to which DUTREBIS may be dialyzable is unknown, \ndosing before a dialysis session should be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment for DUTREBIS is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. The safety and efficacy of lamivudine and raltegravir have not been established in \npatients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, DUTREBIS should be used with caution in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nDUTREBIS should not be used in children below 6 years of age. Dosing in children less than 6 years \nof age and those weighting less than 30 kg requires weight based dose adjustments for the individual \ncomponents of DUTREBIS. Please refer to the SmPC for the individual components of DUTREBIS\nfor dosing instructions. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nMethod of administration\nOral use.\nDUTREBIS tablets can be administered with or without food.\nThe tablets should be swallowed whole, without crushing or chewing.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nDUTREBIS is not recommended for use as monotherapy.\n\nDepression\nDepression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported with raltegravir, particularly \nin patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used \nwhen administering DUTREBIS in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric \nillness.\n\nRenal impairment\nDUTREBIS should not be given in patients with a creatinine clearance of <50 ml/min. Renal function \nshould be monitored in patients more likely to have decreased renal function. If creatinine clearance \ndecreases to <50 ml/min, DUTREBIS should be switched to a regimen of the individual components \n(lamivudine and raltegravir) (see section 4.2). Please refer to the SmPC for the individual components \nof DUTREBIS for dosing instructions.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nOpportunistic infections\nPatients receiving lamivudine or any other ART may continue to develop opportunistic infections and \nother complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical observation by \nphysicians experienced in the treatment of patients with associated HIV diseases.\n\nTransmission of HIV\nPatients should be advised that current antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been \nproven to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. While effective \nviral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual \ntransmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken \nin accordance with national guidelines.\n\nVirologic failure and development of resistance\nOverall, considerable inter- and intra-subject variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of\nraltegravir (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nRaltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, \nDUTREBIS should be administered with another active ART to minimise the potential for virological \nfailure and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).\n\nPancreatitis\nCases of pancreatitis have occurred rarely with lamivudine. However, it is not clear whether these \ncases were due to the ART or to the underlying HIV disease. Treatment with DUTREBIS should be \nstopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis \noccur.\n\nLactic acidosis\nLactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, has been reported with the \nuse of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as lamivudine. Early symptoms \n(symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal \npain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/or deep \nbreathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).\n\nLactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure, or renal \nfailure.\n\nLactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment.\n\nTreatment with NRTIs should be discontinued in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactatemia and \nmetabolic/lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.\n\nCaution should be exercised when administering NRTIs to any patient (particularly obese women) \nwith hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis \n(including certain medicinal products and alcohol). Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated \nwith alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk.\n\nPatients at increased risk should be followed closely.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment for DUTREBIS is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. The safety and efficacy of lamivudine and raltegravir have not been established in \npatients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, DUTREBIS should be used with caution in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during CART and should be monitored according to standard practice. If \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nthere is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of \ntreatment should be considered.\n\nPatients with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus co-infection\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with ART are at an increased risk for severe and \npotentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Physicians should refer to current HIV treatment guidelines \nfor the optimal management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with HBV. In case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information \nfor these medicinal products. If DUTREBIS is discontinued in patients co-infected with hepatitis B \nvirus, periodic monitoring of liver function tests and markers of HBV replication is recommended, as \nwithdrawal of lamivudine may result in an acute exacerbation of hepatitis.\n\nOsteonecrosis\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nLipodystrophy\nCART has been associated with the redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients. The \nlong-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. Knowledge about the mechanism is \nincomplete. A connection between visceral lipomatosis and protease inhibitors (PIs) and lipoatrophy \nand NRTIs has been hypothesised. A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual \nfactors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of ART and associated \nmetabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat \nredistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood \nglucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8).\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterium infections, \nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction\nNucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo \nto cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors. The main adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, \nneutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events are often transitory. \nSome late-onset neurological disorders have been reported (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal \nbehaviour). Whether the neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. Any \nchild exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, even HIV-negative \nchildren, should have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible \nmitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms.\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with raltegravir. DUTREBIS should be used with \ncaution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing \nissues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nCo-administration of other medicinal products\nDUTREBIS should not be taken with any other medicinal products containing lamivudine, raltegravir \nor medicinal products containing emtricitabine.\n\nThe combination of lamivudine with cladribine is not-recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced \nraltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of DUTREBIS with aluminium and/or magnesium \nantacids is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nDUTREBIS should not be co-administered with rifampicin due to reduced plasma concentrations of \nraltegravir (see section 4.5); the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. If rifampicin \nadministration cannot be avoided, DUTREBIS may be switched to a regimen of the individual \ncomponents (lamivudine and raltegravir). Please refer to the SmPC for the individual components of \nDUTREBIS for dosing instructions.\n\nIn addition, caution should also be used when co-administering DUTREBIS with other strong inducers \nof uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1.\n\nSevere skin and hypersensitivity reactions\nSevere, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking \nraltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. \nThese include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity \nreactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and \nsometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue DUTREBIS and other suspect \nagents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop \n(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, \nmuscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, \nangioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate \ntherapy initiated. Delay in stopping DUTREBIS treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of \nsevere rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.\n\nRash\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \nraltegravir + darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir \nwithout raltegravir (see section 4.8).\n\nLactose\nDUTREBIS film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAs DUTREBIS contains lamivudine and raltegravir, any interactions that have been identified with \nthese agents individually, may occur with DUTREBIS. Interaction studies with these agents have only \nbeen performed in adults.\n\nLamivudine metabolism does not involve CYP3A, making interactions with medicinal products \nmetabolised by this system (e.g. PIs) unlikely.\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does \nnot inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not induce \nCYP3A4 and does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is \nnot expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes \nor P-glycoprotein.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nLamivudine is eliminated mainly by active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system. \nThe possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently should be \nconsidered, particularly when the main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic \ncationic transport system e.g. trimethoprim. Other medicinal products (e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine) are \neliminated only in part by this mechanism and were shown not to interact with lamivudine. The NRTIs \n(e.g. didanosine, zidovudine) are not eliminated by this mechanism and are unlikely to interact with \nlamivudine.\n\nBased on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a \nUGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.\n\nAlthough in vitro studies indicated that raltegravir is not an inhibitor of the UDP \nglucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, one clinical study has suggested that some inhibition \nof UGT1A1 may occur in vivo based on effects observed on bilirubin glucuronidation. However, the \nmagnitude of the effect seems unlikely to result in clinically important drug-drug interactions.\n\nConsiderable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of \nraltegravir. The following drug interaction information is based on Geometric Mean values; the effect \nfor an individual patient cannot be predicted precisely. \n\nIn a drug interaction study with DUTREBIS and etravirine, there was no clinically meaningful drug \ninteraction between raltegravir and etravirine, with respect to raltegravir. No dosage adjustment is \nnecessary when these agents are given together.\n\nAdministration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg results in a 40 % increase in \nlamivudine exposure, because of the trimethoprim component; the sulfamethoxazole component did \nnot interact. However, unless the patient has renal impairment, no dosage adjustment of DUTREBIS is \nnecessary (see section 4.2). Lamivudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim or \nsulfamethoxazole. When concomitant administration of DUTREBIS is warranted, patients should be \nmonitored clinically. Co-administration of DUTREBIS with high doses of co-trimoxazole for the \ntreatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis should be avoided.\n\nA modest increase in Cmax (28 %) was observed for zidovudine when administered with lamivudine, \nhowever overall exposure (AUC) is not significantly altered. Zidovudine has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of lamivudine (see section 5.2).\n\nIn vitro lamivudine inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of cladribine leading to a potential risk of \ncladribine loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also \nsupport a possible interaction between lamivudine and cladribine. Therefore, the concomitant use of \nDUTREBIS with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nIn interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, midazolam, or boceprevir.\n\nIn some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in \ndarunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of \nraltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.\n\nDUTREBIS should not be used when co-administered with rifampicin. Rifampicin reduces plasma \nlevels of raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if \nco-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, DUTREBIS may be switched to a regimen of the \nindividual components (lamivudine and raltegravir). Please refer to the SmPC for the individual \ncomponents of DUTREBIS for dosing instructions. Given that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via \nUGT1A1, caution should also be used when co-administering DUTREBIS with other strong inducers \nof UGT1A1. The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin \nand phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, \netravirine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, pioglitazone) may be used with DUTREBIS.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\nCo-administration of DUTREBIS with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 \ninhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors \n(e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent \ncompared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir may increase plasma levels of raltegravir, however, \nthe mechanism for this effect is unknown (see Table 1). From the clinical studies, a large proportion of \npatients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir, both agents that result in increases in raltegravir plasma \nlevels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety profile observed in patients who used \natazanavir and / or tenofovir was generally similar to the safety profile of patients who did not use \nthese agents. Therefore no dose adjustment of DUTREBIS is required.\n\nCo-administration of DUTREBIS with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce \nraltegravir absorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an \naluminium and magnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased \nraltegravir plasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of DUTREBIS with aluminium and/or \nmagnesium containing antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium \ncarbonate antacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered \nclinically meaningful. Therefore, when DUTREBIS is co-administered with calcium carbonate \ncontaining antacids no dose adjustment is required.\n\nCo-administration of DUTREBIS with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and \nfamotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of \nraltegravir (see Table 1). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III studies taking proton \npump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids. \nTherefore no dose adjustment of DUTREBIS is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 \nantagonists.\n\nInteractions between the components of DUTREBIS and co-administered medicinal products are listed \nin

Studies with raltegravir in animals have shown reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nFor patients co-infected with hepatitis who are being treated with DUTREBIS and subsequently \nbecome pregnant, consideration should be given to the possibility of a recurrence of hepatitis on \ndiscontinuation of DUTREBIS.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction\nNucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo \nto cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (see section 4.4).\n\nAnti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry\nTo monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered DUTREBIS while \npregnant, an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to \nregister patients in this registry.\n\nAs a general rule, when deciding to use anti-retroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in \norder to characterise the safety for the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nBreastfeeding is not recommended while taking DUTREBIS. As a general rule, it is recommended that \nmothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their babies in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\nFollowing oral administration, lamivudine was excreted in breast milk at similar concentrations to \nthose found in serum. \n\nIt is not known whether raltegravir is secreted in human milk. However, raltegravir is secreted in the \nmilk of lactating rats. In rats, at a maternal dose of 600 mg/kg/day, mean active substance \nconcentrations in milk were approximately 3-fold greater than in maternal plasma. \n\nFertility\nNo human data on the effect of DUTREBIS on fertility are available. No effect on fertility was seen in \nmale and female rats at doses of raltegravir up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in 3-fold exposure \nabove the exposure at the recommended human dose.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir, \nwhich may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nClinical studies in patients have not been specifically performed with DUTREBIS. The safety profile \nof DUTREBIS is based on the safety data from the individual components of DUTREBIS (lamivudine \nand raltegravir).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported during treatment with lamivudine are headache, nausea, \nmalaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhoea and cough. The most frequently reported \nadverse reactions during treatment with raltegravir were headache and nausea.\n\nCases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic \nsteatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).\n\nCancers were reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-na\u00efve patients who initiated raltegravir\nin conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specific cancers were those \nexpected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was \nsimilar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14\n\nGrade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with raltegravir. \nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use DUTREBIS with caution in patients who have \nhad myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).\n\nCART has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including \nthe loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast \nhypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).\n\nCART has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, \nhypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune \nreactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many \nmonths after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during therapy for HIV disease with lamivudine\nand/or raltegravir (alone or in combination with other ART).\n\nThe adverse reactions seen in clinical studies and in post-marketing experience are listed below by \nbody system, organ class and absolute frequency.

anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental \ndisorder, suicide attempt, gastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.\n\nIn clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients receiving raltegravir, rash, irrespective of \ncausality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared \nto those containing raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by \nthe investigator to be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all \ncausality) were 10.9, 4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash\nwere 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to \nmoderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \nIn Phase III studies with raltegravir, treatment-experienced patients (N = 114/699 or 16 %; HBV=6 %, \nHCV=9 %, HBV+HCV=1 %) and treatment-na\u00efve patients (N = 34/563 or 6 %; HBV=4 %, \nHCV=2 %, HBV+HCV=0.2 %) with chronic (but not acute) active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C \nco-infection were permitted to enrol provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times \nthe upper limit of normal. In general the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B and/or \nhepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \nco-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat higher in the subgroup \nwith hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection for both treatment groups. At 96-weeks, in \ntreatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening \nGrade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and 13 %, respectively, of \nco-infected subjects treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % of all other subjects \ntreated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory \nabnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred \nin 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with raltegravir as compared to \n13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other subjects treated with raltegravir.\n\nThe following adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance of raltegravir: \nthrombocytopenia, suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour (particularly in patients with a pre-existing \nhistory of psychiatric illness), hepatic failure, Stevens Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia \nand systemic symptoms (DRESS), rhabdomyolysis.\n\nPaediatric population\nDUTREBIS should not be used in children below 6 years of age or in patients weighing less than \n30 kg due to weight based dosing requirements in this patient population (see section 5.2).\n\nRaltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and \nadolescents 2 through 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT \nP1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of \nraltegravir.\n\nIn these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, \nabnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic \nrash.\n\nOne patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which \nwere considered serious.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAdministration of lamivudine at very high dose levels in acute animal studies did not result in any \norgan toxicity. Limited data are available on the consequences of ingestion of acute overdoses in \nhumans. No fatalities occurred, and the patients recovered.

The \nextent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations, ATC code: J05AR16\n\nMechanism of action\nLamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) which has activity against human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). \n\nRaltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n(HIV-1). \n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\nIn vitro data tend to suggest that the continuation of lamivudine in anti-retroviral regimen despite the \ndevelopment of M184V might provide residual anti-retroviral activity (likely through impaired viral \nfitness). The clinical relevance of these findings is not established. \nRaltegravir at concentrations of 31 \uf0b1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication \n(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the \ncell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of\nmitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical \nisolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited \ninfection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with \nIC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. \n\nResistance\nHIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V amino acid change close to the \nactive site of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). This variant arises both in vitro and in HIV-1 \ninfected patients treated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy. M184V mutants display \ngreatly reduced susceptibility to lamivudine and show diminished viral replicative capacity in vitro. In \nvitro studies indicate that zidovudine-resistant virus isolates can become zidovudine sensitive when \nthey simultaneously acquire resistance to lamivudine. The clinical relevance of such findings remains, \nhowever, not well defined.\n\nCross-resistance conferred by the M184V RT is limited within the nucleoside inhibitor class of \nantiretroviral agents. Zidovudine and stavudine maintain their antiretroviral activities against \nlamivudine-resistant HIV-1. Abacavir maintains its antiretroviral activities against lamivudine \nresistant HIV-1 harbouring only the M184V mutation. The M184V RT mutant shows a <4-fold \ndecrease in susceptibility to didanosine; the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In vitro \nsusceptibility testing has not been standardised and results may vary according to methodological \nfactors.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19\n\nLamivudine demonstrates low cytotoxicity to peripheral blood lymphocytes, to established \nlymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell lines, and to a variety of bone marrow progenitor cells in \nvitro.\n\nMost viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting \nfrom the appearance of two or more mutations. Most had a signature mutation at amino acid 155 \n(N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 (Y143 \nchanged to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, E92Q, \nT97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral \nsusceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir \nsusceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline \nviral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir \ngenerally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at \namino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation \nconfers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino \nacid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically \nsignificant resistance to dolutegravir.\n\nClinical efficacy with lamivudine\nIn clinical studies, lamivudine in combination with zidovudine has been shown to reduce HIV-1 viral \nload and increase CD4 cell count. Clinical end-point data indicate that lamivudine in combination with \nzidovudine, results in a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression and mortality. \n\nEvidence from clinical studies shows that lamivudine plus zidovudine delays the emergence of \nzidovudine resistant isolates in individuals with no prior antiretroviral therapy.\n\nLamivudine has been widely used as a component of antiretroviral combination therapy with other \nantiretroviral agents of the same class (NRTIs) or different classes (PIs, non-nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors).\n\nMultiple drug antiretroviral therapy containing lamivudine has been shown to be effective in \nantiretrovirally-naive patients as well as in patients presenting with viruses containing the M184V \nmutations.\n\nThe relationship between in vitro susceptibility of HIV to lamivudine and clinical response to \nlamivudine-containing therapy remains under investigation.\n\nLamivudine has not been specifically investigated in HIV patients co-infected with HBV.\n\nClinical efficacy with raltegravir\nThe evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two  \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, \nProtocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the \nanalysis of 240-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial, (STARTMRK, \nProtocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients.\n\nTreatment-experienced adult patients\nBENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudies) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo \nin a combination with optimized background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or \nolder, with documented resistance to at least 1 medicinal product in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, \nNNRTIs, PIs) of anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomization, OBT were selected by the \ninvestigator based on the patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and \nphenotypic viral resistance testing. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo.

Enfuvirtide use in OBT in \nenfuvirtide-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-na\u00efve \npatients was counted as one active drug in OBT.\n\nRaltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA \n< 50 copies/ml in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. \nSome patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with \nfailure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent. \n\nSwitch to raltegravir\nThe SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving \nsuppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir \n200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors and randomized them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and \nn=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and \nn=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the \nnumber of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. \n\nThese studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to \ndemonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, \nsuppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/ml was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group \nversus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 \nregarding the need to administer raltegravir with another active agent.\n\nTreatment-naive adult patients\nSTARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control study) evaluated the safety and \nanti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a \ncombination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir, in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected patients with HIV \nRNA > 5,000 copies/ml. Randomization was stratified by screening HIV RNA level \n(\u226450,000 copies/ml; and > 50,000 copies/ml) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or negative).\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroup receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime. \n\nResults 48-week and 240-week analyses\nWith respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion (%) of patients achieving HIV RNA \n< 50 copies/ml at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 \n(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment difference (raltegravir\u2013 efavirenz) was 4.2 % \nwith an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inferior to efavirenz \n(p-value for non-inferiority < 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment difference (raltegravir \u2013 efavirenz) \nwas 9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3).

Lamivudine in the fixed-\ndose combination tablet was bioequivalent with the lamivudine (single agent) after administration of \nthe individual component. Raltegravir in the fixed-dose combination tablet was not bioequivalent with \nrespect to C12, however, based on PK/PD modelling, no clinically meaningful differences in \nraltegravir exposure are expected following administration of the fixed-dose combination tablet \ncompared to administration of raltegravir as a single agent.\n\nAbsorption\nWhen DUTREBIS is administered, raltegravir is absorbed with a Tmax of approximately 1 hour in the \nfasted state. This is slightly faster than the raltegravir poloxamer formulation, which has a Tmax of \napproximately 3 hours. The bioavailablity of the raltegravir component of DUTREBIS in the fasted \nstate is approximately 60 %, which is higher than the bioavailability of raltegravir in the raltegravir \npoloxamer formulation, and accounts for the difference in raltegravir dose. Once absorbed the \nlamivudine and raltegravir distribution, metabolism, and excretion are similar to those of the reference \ncomponents administered individually as described in the following paragraphs.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24\n\nLamivudine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the bioavailability of oral lamivudine \nin adults is normally between 80 and 85 %. Following oral administration, the mean time (tmax) to \nmaximal serum concentrations (Cmax) is about an hour. Based on data derived from a study in healthy \nvolunteers, at a therapeutic dose of 150 mg twice daily, mean (CV) steady-state Cmax and Cmin of \nlamivudine in plasma are 1.2 \u03bcg/ml (24 %) and 0.09 \u03bcg/ml (27 %), respectively. The mean (CV) AUC \nover a dosing interval of 12 hours is 4.7 \u03bcg\u2022h/ml (18 %). At a therapeutic dose of 300 mg once daily, \nthe mean (CV) steady-state Cmax, Cmin and 24h AUC are 2.0 \u03bcg/ml (26 %), 0.04 \u03bcg/ml (34 %) and \n8.9 \u03bcg\u2022h/ml (21 %), respectively.\n\nCo-administration of zidovudine with lamivudine results in a 13 % increase in zidovudine exposure \nand a 28 % increase in peak plasma levels. This is not considered to be of significance to patient safety \nand therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary.\n\nAs demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state,\nraltegravir AUC and Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. \nRaltegravir C12 hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases \nslightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality \nhas not been established in patients.\n\nWith twice-daily dosing of raltegravir, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within \napproximately the first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and \nevidence of slight accumulation in C12 hr. \n\nOverall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed \nC12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % \nand the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability within the BENCHMRK study \nmay include differences in co-administration with food and concomitant medicines. Overall, the \nresults of the clinical pharmacology studies with DUTREBIS demonstrate similar drug exposures \ncompared to the individual components of lamivudine and raltegravir, including similar variability in \nraltegravir C12hr and Cmax. The pharmacokinetic properties, use in special populations and drug-drug \ninteractions for each of the individual components (lamivudine and raltegravir) are applicable to \nDUTREBIS.\n\nAn open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-period crossover study assessed the effect of a high fat \nmeal on DUTREBIS administered to 20 healthy male and female subjects. Similar AUC values for fed \nvs. fasted and somewhat lower Cmax values (23 % for raltegravir and 21 % for lamivudine) were \nobserved with DUTREBIS. In addition, higher C12h levels (20 % for raltegravir and 53 % for \nlamivudine) were observed. These changes are not considered clinically meaningful; therefore,\nDUTREBIS may be administered with or without food.\n\nDistribution\nIn intravenous studies with lamivudine, the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 l/kg. The observed \nhalf-life of elimination is 5 to 7 hours. The mean systemic clearance of lamivudine is approximately \n0.32 l/h/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (> 70 %) via the organic cationic transport system.\n\nLamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays limited \nbinding to the major plasma protein albumin (< 16 % - 36 % to serum albumin in in vitro studies).\n\nLimited data show that lamivudine penetrates the central nervous system and reaches the cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF). The mean ratio CSF/serum lamivudine concentration 2-4 hours after oral administration \nwas approximately 0.12. The true extent of penetration or relationship with any clinical efficacy is \nunknown.\n\nRaltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to \n10 \u00b5M. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25\n\nRaltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable \nextent.\n\nIn two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was \nreadily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid \nconcentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second \nstudy (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the \ncorresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower \nthan the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.\n\nBiotransformation and excretion \nThe active moiety, intracellular lamivudine triphosphate, has a prolonged terminal half-life in the cell \n(16 to 19 hours) compared to the plasma lamivudine half-life (5 to 7 hours). \n\nLamivudine is predominately cleared unchanged by renal excretion. The likelihood of metabolic \ninteractions of lamivudine with other medicinal products is low due to the small extent of hepatic \nmetabolism (5-10 %) and low plasma protein binding.\n\nStudies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is affected by renal \ndysfunction. DUTREBIS should not be given in patients with a creatinine clearance of <50 ml/min \n(see section 4.2).\n\nAn interaction with trimethoprim, a constituent of co-trimoxazole, causes a 40 % increase in \nlamivudine exposure at therapeutic doses. This does not require dose adjustment unless the patient also \nhas renal impairment (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). Administration of co-trimoxazole with lamivudine in \npatients with renal impairment should be carefully assessed.\n\nThe apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life \n(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled \nraltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In \nfaeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of \nraltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely \nraltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and \n23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented \napproximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for \nby raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed \nUDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the \nformation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of \nraltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.\n\nUGT1A1 Polymorphism\nIn a comparison of 30 subjects receiving raltegravir with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with \nwild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the \ngeometric mean ratio of C12 hr was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in \nsubjects with reduced UGT1A1 activity due to genetic polymorphism.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of DUTREBIS in the paediatric patient population has not been studied in \nclinical studies. DUTREBIS should not be used in children below 6 years of age or in patients \nweighing less than 30 kg due to weight based dosing requirements in this patient population.\n\nThe dosing regimen of the lamivudine component of DUTREBIS in the paediatric population is the \nsame as the dosing regimen of the individual component (EPIVIR).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26\n\nThe raltegravir component in DUTREBIS (300 mg raltegravir) fixed-dose combination tablet was not \nbioequivalent with respect to C12, however, based on PK/PD modelling, no clinically meaningful \ndifferences in raltegravir exposure are expected. Based on modelling and simulation using raltegravir \npharmacokinetic data in adults, the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in DUTREBIS in children was \nprojected to result in exposures that have been previously shown to be safe and efficacious in adults. \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of DUTREBIS in children under 6 years of age has not been established.\n\nElderly\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for DUTREBIS based on age. The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine \nafter administration to patients over 65 years of age have not been studied; however, there was no \nclinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics over the age range studied (19 to \n71 years, with few (8) subjects over the age of 65).\n\nGender, race and BMI\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for DUTREBIS based on gender, race, or BMI. There were no \nclinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass index (BMI) for \nraltegravir in adults.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo study has been performed with DUTREBIS in subjects with renal insufficiency. Recommendations \nare based on available data from the individual components. DUTREBIS should not be given in \npatients with a creatinine clearance of <50 ml/min. Renal function should be monitored in patients \nmore likely to have decreased renal function. If the creatinine clearance decreases to <50 ml/min, \nDUTREBIS should be switched to a regimen of the individual components (lamivudine and \nraltegravir). Please refer to the SmPC for the individual components of DUTREBIS for dosing \ninstructions. Because the extent to which DUTREBIS may be dialyzable is unknown, dosing before a \ndialysis session should be avoided (see section 4.2). \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been determined in a small group of \nHIV-1-infected adults with impaired renal function.\n\nExposure (AUC\u221e), Cmax, and half-life increased with diminishing renal function (as expressed by \ncreatinine clearance). Apparent total oral clearance (Cl/F) of lamivudine decreased as creatinine \nclearance decreased. Tmax was not significantly affected by renal function.  \n\nFor raltegravir, renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. A study of the \npharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in adult patients with severe renal insufficiency. \nAdditionally, renal insufficiency was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis. There were \nno clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal insufficiency \nand healthy subjects. \n\nHepatic impairment\nNo study has been performed with DUTREBIS in subjects with hepatic insufficiency. \nRecommendations are based on available data from the individual components. No dosage adjustment \nfor DUTREBIS is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency.\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been determined in adults with impaired hepatic \nfunction. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered by diminishing hepatic function; therefore, no \ndose adjustment for lamivudine is required for patients with impaired hepatic function. Safety and \nefficacy of lamivudine have not been established in the presence of decompensated liver disease.\n\nRaltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically \nimportant pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and \nhealthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has \nnot been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27\n\nPharmacokinetics in pregnancy\nFollowing oral administration, lamivudine pharmacokinetics in late pregnancy were similar to \nnon-pregnant women.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNo animal studies have been conducted with DUTREBIS. The following data are based on findings in \nseparate studies with the individual components of DUTREBIS (lamivudine and raltegravir).\n\nAdministration of lamivudine in animal toxicity studies at high doses was not associated with any \nmajor organ toxicity. At the highest dosage levels, minor effects on indicators of liver and kidney \nfunction were seen together with occasional reductions in liver weight. The clinically relevant effects \nnoted were a reduction in red blood cell count and neutropenia.\n\nNon-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with \nraltegravir, in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical \nexposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.\n\nMutagenicity\nLamivudine was not mutagenic in bacterial tests but, like many nucleoside analogues, showed activity \nin an in vitro cytogenetic assay and the mouse lymphoma assay. Lamivudine was not genotoxic in vivo \nat doses that gave plasma concentrations around 40-50 times higher than the anticipated clinical \nplasma levels. As the in vitro mutagenic activity of lamivudine could not be confirmed in in vivo tests, \nit is concluded that lamivudine should not represent a genotoxic hazard to patients undergoing \ntreatment.\n\nA transplacental genotoxicity study conducted in monkeys compared zidovudine alone with the \ncombination of zidovudine and lamivudine at human-equivalent exposures. The study demonstrated \nthat foetuses exposed in utero to the combination sustained a higher level of nucleoside \nanalogue-DNA incorporation into multiple foetal organs, and showed evidence of more telomere \nshortening than in those exposed to zidovudine alone. The clinical significance of these findings is \nunknown.\n\nNo evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) \ntests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal \naberration studies conducted with raltegravir.\n\nCarcinogenicity\nThe results of long-term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in rats and mice did not show any \ncarcinogenic potential relevant for humans.\n\nA carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest \ndose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to \nthat at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the \nnose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in \nmales. These neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of \nthe nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it \nis likely that they are of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic \nexposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies \nto evaluate mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.\n\nDevelopmental toxicity\nRaltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase \nin incidence of supernumerary ribs was observed in rat pups of dams exposed to raltegravir at \napproximately 4.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice daily based on AUC0-24 hr.

What DUTREBIS is and what it is used for\n\nWhat DUTREBIS is\nDUTREBIS is an antiretroviral medicine used to treat infection with human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV). It contains the active substances lamivudine and raltegravir:\n\uf0b7 Lamivudine belongs to a group of medicines called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors (NRTIs)\n\uf0b7 Raltegravir belongs to a group of medicines called HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors\n\nWhat DUTREBIS is used for\nDUTREBIS is used to treat HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). HIV is the virus that causes \nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n\nDUTREBIS is used in combination with other medicines to treat adults, adolescents, and children \n6 years of age and older and weighing at least 30 kg who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has \nprescribed DUTREBIS to help control your HIV infection.\n\nHow DUTREBIS works\nWhen used with other medicines, DUTREBIS may:\n\uf0b7 reduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\")\n\uf0b7 increase your CD4-cell count (a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in \n\nmaintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection). \nReducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of your immune system. This \nmeans your body may fight infection better. \nDUTREBIS also helps stop the production of an enzyme called \u201cHIV integrase\u201d. This enzyme is \nneeded for HIV to make more virus.\nDUTREBIS is not a cure for HIV infection.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40\n\n2. What you need to know before you take DUTREBIS\n\nDo not take DUTREBIS:\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to lamivudine, raltegravir or any of the other ingredients in this medicine \n\nlisted in section 6.\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking DUTREBIS.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nRemember that DUTREBIS is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV, if you don\u2019t take DUTREBIS as your doctor has \ninstructed you.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking DUTREBIS if:\n\uf0b7 you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including suicidal thoughts \n\nand behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking raltegravir (one of the medicines in\nDUTREBIS), particularly in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\n\uf0b7 you have kidney problems - Your doctor may decide to change your dose by using the \nmedicines in DUTREBIS separately.\n\n\uf0b7 you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may \nevaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take this medicine. Do not \nstop taking DUTREBIS without your doctor\u2019s advice.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking DUTREBIS.\n\nPassing HIV to others\nHIV infection is spread by contact with blood or sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still \npass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective therapy. Discuss \nwith your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nLook out for side effects\nDUTREBIS can cause some side effects that you need to talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse \nabout. See section 4 for more information about side effects.\n\nSkin problems\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions \nand allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking raltegravir (one of the medicines \nin DUTREBIS).\n\nMuscle problems\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, \ntenderness or weakness while taking this medicine.\n\nInfections\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such \nas:\n\uf0b7 fever, and/or feeling unwell. \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and \nsymptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune \nresponse, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious \nsymptoms. \n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for \nthe treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start \nof treatment. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41\n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection or \nother symptoms such as:\n\uf0b7 muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity.\n\nLactic acidosis\nSome people taking DUTREBIS, or similar medicines, may get a side effect called \u201clactic \nacidosis\u201d and a swollen liver. Lactic acidosis is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the body. It \nis rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) and if it does happen, it usually happens after a few \nmonths of treatment. It can be life-threatening, and cause internal organs to fail.\n\uf0b7 Lactic acidosis is more likely to happen in people who have liver problems, or in people who \nare very overweight, especially women.\nDuring your treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of lactic acidosis. \nTell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following signs of lactic acidosis, or any other \nsymptoms that worry you:\n\uf0b7 deep, fast, difficult breathing, feeling drowsy, numb or weak arms or legs, feeling or being sick \n(nausea or vomiting), stomach pain. \n\nBone problems\nSome patients taking combination treatment for HIV may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). This may be more \nlikely with long-term HIV treatment, more severe damage to the immune system, overweight, or \nthe use of alcohol or other medicines called corticosteroids.\nTell your doctor if you notice any of the following signs of osteonecrosis:\n\uf0b7 joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty moving. \n\nChanges in body shape\nTalk to your doctor if you notice changes in your body shape. People taking anti-retroviral \nmedicines may find that their body shape changes. This is because of changes in fat distribution:\n\uf0b7 fat may be lost from the legs, arms or face; extra fat may build up around the tummy, breasts or \ninternal organs; fatty lumps (sometimes called buffalo hump) may appear on the back of the neck. \nIt is not yet known what causes these changes, or whether they have any long-term effects. \n\nSome people taking DUTREBIS or other antiretroviral medicines may have other effects show up \nin their blood tests: \n\uf0b7 increased levels of lactic acid in the blood, which on rare occasions can lead to lactic acidosis; \nincreased levels of sugar and fats (triglycerides and cholesterol) in the blood; resistance to insulin \n(so if you are diabetic, you may have to change your insulin dose to control your blood sugar).\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDUTREBIS is not for use in children below 6 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and DUTREBIS\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because DUTREBIS might interact with other medicines.\n\nDUTREBIS must not be used with the following medicines. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if \nyou are taking, have recently taken or might take:\n\uf0b7 medicines containing lamivudine \u2013 used to treat HIV or hepatitis B.\n\uf0b7 medicines containing raltegravair or emtricitabine \u2013 used to treat HIV.\n\uf0b7 high doses of co-trimoxazole \u2013 used to treat infections.\n\uf0b7 trimethoprim \u2013 used to treat infections.\n\uf0b7 interferons taken with or without ribavirin \u2013 used to treat hepatitis.\n\uf0b7 cladribine \u2013 used to treat hairy cell leukaemia.\n\uf0b7 antacids containing aluminium and/or magnesium \u2013 used for heartburn. Talk to your doctor \n\nabout other medicines you can take.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42\n\n\uf0b7 rifampicin \u2013 used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis. Rifampicin may decrease your \nlevels of raltegravir (one of the medicines in DUTREBIS). Your doctor may decide to change \nyour dose by using the medicines in DUTREBIS separately, if you are taking rifampicin.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\uf0b7 DUTREBIS is not recommended in pregnancy. \n\uf0b7 Women with HIV should not breast-feed their infants because babies can be infected with HIV \n\nthrough their breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby.\n\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine.\n\nDUTREBIS film-coated tablets contain lactose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take DUTREBIS\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. DUTREBIS must be used in combination with other\nmedicines for HIV. \n\nHow much to take\nAdults, children, and adolescents\nThe recommended dose is 1 tablet twice a day.\n\nTaking this medicine\n\uf0b7 Swallow the tablet whole (do not crush or chew). \n\uf0b7 This medicine can be taken with or without food or drink.\n\nIf you take more DUTREBIS than you should\nDo not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your \ndoctor.\n\nIf you forget to take DUTREBIS\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. If you notice within 6 hours, you must \ntake the tablet immediately. If you notice after 6 hours, then skip the intake and take the next doses as \nusual.\n\nIf you stop taking DUTREBIS\nIt is important that you take DUTREBIS exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not stop taking it \nbecause:\n\uf0b7 It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. \n\nThis can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will \nstop being able to fight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").\n\n\uf0b7 When your supply of DUTREBIS starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. \nThis is because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During \na short break in taking the medicine, the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may \nmean that the HIV virus will develop resistance to DUTREBIS and become harder to treat.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n43\n\n4.

in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") increase your cd4-cell count (a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection). reducing the amount of hiv in the blood may improve the functioning of your immune system. this means your body may fight infection better. dutrebis also helps stop the production of an

the other ingredients in this medicine listed in section 6. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking dutrebis. warnings and precautions remember that dutrebis is not a cure for hiv infection. this means that you may keep getting infections or other illnesses associated with hiv, if you don't take dutrebis as your doctor has instructed you. talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking dutrebis if: you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. depression, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking raltegravir (one of the medicines in dutrebis), particularly in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness. you have kidney problems - your doctor may decide to change your dose by using the medicines in dutrebis separately. you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis b or c. your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take this medicine. do not stop taking dutrebis without your doctor's advice. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking dutrebis. passing hiv to others hiv infection is spread by contact with blood or sexual contact with a person with hiv. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective therapy. discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. look out for side effects dutrebis can cause some side effects that you need to talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about. see section 4 for more information about side effects. skin problems talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a rash. severe and life-threatening skin reactions and allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking raltegravir (one of the medicines in dutrebis). muscle problems talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness while taking this medicine. infections tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as: fever, and/or feeling unwell. in some patients with advanced hiv infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as: muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity. lactic acidosis some people taking dutrebis, or similar medicines, may get a side effect called \"lactic acidosis\" and a swollen liver. lactic acidosis is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the body. it is rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) and if it does happen, it usually happens after a few months of treatment. it can be life-threatening, and cause internal organs to fail. lactic acidosis is more likely to happen in people who have liver problems, or in people who are very overweight, especially women. during your treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of lactic acidosis. tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following signs of lactic acidosis, or any other symptoms that worry you: deep, fast, difficult breathing, feeling drowsy, numb or weak arms or legs, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting), stomach pain. bone problems some patients taking combination treatment for hiv may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). this may be more likely with long-term hiv treatment, more severe damage to the immune system, overweight, or the use of alcohol or other medicines called corticosteroids. tell your doctor if you notice any of the following signs of osteonecrosis: joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty moving. changes in body shape talk to your doctor if you notice changes in your body shape. people taking anti-retroviral medicines may find that their body shape changes. this is because of changes in fat distribution: fat may be lost from the legs, arms or face; extra fat may build up around the tummy, breasts or internal organs; fatty lumps (sometimes called buffalo hump) may appear on the back of the neck. it is not yet known what causes these changes, or whether they have any long-term effects. some people taking dutrebis or other antiretroviral medicines may have other effects show up in their blood tests: increased levels of lactic acid in the blood, which on rare occasions can lead to lactic acidosis; increased levels of sugar and fats (triglycerides and cholesterol) in the blood; resistance to insulin (so if you are diabetic, you may have to change your insulin dose to control your blood sugar). children and adolescents dutrebis is not for use in children below 6 years of age. other medicines and dutrebis tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this is because dutrebis might interact with other medicines. dutrebis must not be used with the following medicines. tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take: medicines containing lamivudine used to treat hiv or hepatitis b. medicines containing raltegravair or emtricitabine used to treat hiv. high doses of co-trimoxazole used to treat infections. trimethoprim used to treat infections. interferons taken with or without ribavirin used to treat hepatitis. cladribine used to treat hairy cell leukaemia. antacids containing aluminium and/or magnesium used for heartburn. talk to your doctor about other medicines you can take. rifampicin used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis. rifampicin may decrease your levels of raltegravir (one of the medicines in dutrebis). your doctor may decide to change your dose by using the medicines in dutrebis separately, if you are taking rifampicin. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. dutrebis is not recommended in pregnancy. women with hiv should not breast-feed their infants because babies can be infected with hiv through their breast milk. talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby. ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. driving and using machines do not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine. dutrebis film-coated tablets contain lactose if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "dutrebis", "Type":
