NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nVIZAMYL 400 MBq/mL solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \n\nEach mL of solution for injection contains 400 MBq of flutemetamol (18F) at reference date and time. \n\n \n\nThe activity per vial may range from 400 MBq to 4000 MBq or from 400 MBq to 6000 MBq at the \n\nreference date and time. \n\n \n\nFluorine (18F) decays to stable oxygen (18O) with a half-life of approximately 110 minutes by emitting \n\na positron radiation of 634 keV, followed by photonic annihilation radiation of 511 keV. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nEach mL of solution contains 55.2 mg of ethanol and 4.1 mg of sodium. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL is a radiopharmaceutical medicinal product indicated for Positron Emission Tomography \n\n(PET) imaging of \u03b2-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive \n\nimpairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive \n\nimpairment. VIZAMYL should be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation. \n\n \n\nA negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. For the \n\nlimitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n\n \n\nA PET scan with flutemetamol (18F) should be requested by clinicians experienced in the clinical \n\nmanagement of neurodegenerative disorders. \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images \n\nwith flutemetamol (18F). A recent co-registered Computed Tomography (CT) scan or Magnetic \n\nResonance (MR) scan of the patient to obtain a fused PET-CT or PET-MR image is recommended in \n\ncases of uncertainty about the location of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border in the PET \n\nscan (see section 4.4 Interpretation of VIZAMYL images). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe recommended activity for an adult is 185 MBq of flutemetamol (18F) administered intravenously \n\n(as a bolus within approximately 40 seconds). The volume of the injection should be not less than \n\n1 mL and not more than 10 mL. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nExtensive dose-range and adjustment studies with the medicinal product in normal and special \n\npopulations have not been performed.  \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended based on age. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment  \n\nVIZAMYL has not been studied in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. Careful \n\nconsideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation exposure is \n\npossible in these patients (see section 4.4). The pharmacokinetics of flutemetamol (18F) in patients \n\nwith renal or hepatic impairment has not been characterised. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThere is no relevant use of VIZAMYL in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nVIZAMYL is for intravenous use. \n\n \n\nThe activity of flutemetamol (18F) has to be measured with a dose calibrator immediately prior to \n\ninjection. \n\n \n\nInjection of VIZAMYL through a short intravenous catheter (approximately 12.5 cm or less) \n\nminimises the potential for adsorption of the active substance to the catheter. \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL is for multidose use. It must not be diluted. \n\n \n\nThe dose is administered by intravenous bolus injection within approximately 40 seconds. If using an \n\nintravenous line, follow the injection with an intravenous flush of 5 mL to 15 mL of sterile sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure full delivery of the dose. \n\n \n\nThe injection of flutemetamol (18F) must be intravenous in order to avoid irradiation as a result of local \n\nextravasation, as well as imaging artefacts. \n\n \n\nImage acquisition  \n\nVIZAMYL images should be acquired starting 90 minutes after injection, using a PET scanner in 3D \n\nmode with appropriate data corrections. Position the patient supine with the patient\u2019s brain (including \n\nthe cerebellum) within a single field of view. The patient\u2019s head should be tilted so that the anterior \n\ncommissure-posterior commissure (ACPC) plane is at right angles to the bore-axis of the PET scanner \n\nwith the head positioned in a suitable head support. Reducing head movement with tape or other \n\nflexible head restraints may be employed. \n\n \n\nIterative or filtered back projection reconstruction is recommended with a slice thickness of 2 to \n\n4 mm, and an axial matrix size of 128 x 128 with pixel sizes of approximately 2 mm. Where a post-\n\nsmoothing filter may be applied with a full width half maximum (FWHM) of not more than 5 mm, the \n\nfilter FWHM should be chosen to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio while preserving the sharpness of \n\nthe reconstructed image. The scan duration should typically be 20 minutes. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nPotential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions \n\nIf hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate \n\naction in emergencies the necessary medicinal products and equipment such as endotracheal tube and \n\nventilator must be readily available. \n\n \n\nIndividual benefit/risk justification \n\nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justified by the likely benefit. The activity \n\nadministered should, in every case, be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required \n\ndiagnostic information. \n\n \n\nRenal /Hepatic impairment  \n\nCareful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation \n\nexposure is possible. Flutemetamol (18F) is excreted largely through the hepatobiliary system and \n\npatients with hepatic impairment have the potential of increased radiation exposure. See section 4.2. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nFor information on the use in the paediatric population, see sections 4.2 or 5.1. \n\n \n\nInterpretation of VIZAMYL images \n\nVIZAMYL images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images \n\nwith flutemetamol (18F). A negative scan indicates none or a sparse density of cortical \u03b2-amyloid \n\nneuritic plaques. A positive scan indicates a moderate to frequent density. Image interpretation errors \n\nin the estimation of brain \u03b2-amyloid neuritic plaque density, including false negatives and false \n\npositives, have been observed. \n\n \n\nPET images should be read using a Sokoloff, Rainbow or Spectrum colour scale. The reader should \n\ncompare the cortical grey matter signal intensity to the maximum white matter signal intensity. The \n\nimages should be viewed in a systematic manner (Figure 1) starting at the level of pons (p) and \n\nscrolling up through \n\n- The frontal lobes and anterior cingulate (f, ac, axial review) \n- Posterior cingulate and precuneus (pc, sagittal review) \n- Temporo-parietal aspects including Insula (in, axial review and tp-in, coronal review) \n- Lateral temporal lobes (lt, axial review) \n- Striatal region (s, axial review) \n \n\nInterpretation of the images is performed visually by comparing the activity in cortical grey matter \n\nwith activity in adjacent cortical white matter.  \n\n \n\n- A region is considered as having a negative (normal) pattern if the tracer signal in cortical \nregions is low (i.e. distinctly lower signal intensity compared with adjacent white matter and \n\nsimilar in intensity to the grey matter-rich regions of the cerebellum). Signal will not be \n\ncompletely absent in grey matter regions of the images, as white matter binding in adjacent \n\nregions will bleed into the grey matter regions due to PET partial volume resolution effects. \n\n- A region is considered positive (abnormal) if the tracer signal in cortical regions appears high \n(i.e., approximately at the same or higher signal intensity as adjacent white matter and greater \n\nthan the grey matter-rich regions of the cerebellum). \n\n- If any one of these regions is clearly positive (abnormal) then the image should be classified as \npositive (abnormal). Otherwise it should be classified as negative (normal). \n\n \n\nAtrophy may be present in many areas of the brain and may render image interpretation more difficult \n\nas loss of grey matter will result in reduced tracer uptake making a positive scan more difficult to \n\nrecognise. It is strongly recommended to review MR or CT images when available to aid interpretation \n\nof the VIZAMYL image, especially when atrophy is suspected.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nFigure 1 \n\nVIZAMYL PET cases showing examples of negative flutemetamol (18F) PET scan (left) and positive \n\nscan (right). Axial view (first row), sagittal view (second row) and coronal view (third row) are \n\ndisplayed. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1. Axial (a), Sagittal (b) and coronal (c) views of a negative and positive flutemetamol (18F) \n\nscans (left and right respectively). The negative images show a sulcal/gyral white matter pattern. The \n\nsulcal and gyral pattern is not discernible in the positive images on the right. Note that the intensity is \n\nhigher (> 60% of max) in the grey matter regions of the positive images compared to the negative \n\nimages and that the intensity radiates to a sharply defined convex edge in the lateral aspects. The \n\nnegative images show a tapered intensity to the periphery of the tissue. Note also the medial regions \n\nwhere higher levels of intensity in the grey matter are seen in the positive images on the right.  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nKey: Grey matter \u2013 f frontal and ac anterior cingulate, pc posterior cingulate and precuneus, lt lateral \n\ntemporal, tp temporo-parietal and in insula and and s striatum. White matter \u2013 p pons and cc corpus \n\ncallosum.  \n\n \n\n \n\nQuantitative assessment of cortical radioactive signal intensity using validated and CE marked \n\ncomputer software may be used to assist in the visual estimate of radioactive signal distribution. Such \n\nsoftware provides a calculation of brain amyloid load by dividing the mean image intensity in the \n\ncortical regions associated with amyloid deposition (raised in AD subjects) with the mean image \n\nintensity in a reference region such as the pons. The measure is referred to as Standard Uptake Value \n\nratio or SUVR.  Dichotomous visual reads for flutemetamol (18F) scans were validated against the \n\nboundary between sparse and moderate neuritic plaque densities. An SUVR threshold value of 0.59 to \n\n0.61 derived from CE marked software using the pons as a reference has been determined to give very \n\nhigh concordance with visual reads (see section 5.1) and may be used as an adjunct to visual reading.   \n\n \n\nUsers should be trained in the use of CE marked software by the manufacturer and should have \n\ncompleted the reader training for the visual interpretation of Vizamyl images.  \n\n \n\nIn case of discordance of visual read and quantitation result, the following steps should be carefully \n\nconsidered to come to a final assessment. \n\n \n\nReaders should interpret the scan visually and then perform quantitation analysis according to \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions including quality checks for the quantitation process. The results of \n\nquantitation should be compared to the visual interpretation, paying attention to the expected ranges \n\nfor a negative or positive scan. If the quantitation values are inconsistent with the visual interpretation, \n\nthe reviewer should:  \n\n \n1. Check the placement of the regions of interest (ROIs) on the brain image. The regions should \n\nbe placed on the grey matter regions of the brain such that the ROIs do not include CSF or \n\nsignificant areas of white matter.  \n\n2. Examine the placement of the reference region ROI(s) to ensure that these are well fitted to \nthe region. Secondly, examine the appearance of the reference region looking for any \n\nstructural abnormalities or areas of reduced perfusion.  \n\n3. Specifics of opposing visual and quantitative results \ni) In the case of an amyloid positive visual read and an amyloid negative or borderline \n\nquantitative result, a comparison should be made between the regions showing visual \n\npositivity and the equivalent area sampled by a ROI. In the case where tracer uptake is highly \n\nfocal, it may be that the ROI samples a larger area and the average of the ROI returns a \n\nnegative result. Further, a visual read may be conducted in such a way as to avoid atrophied \n\nregions, while quantitation may include these areas. \n\nii) In the case of an amyloid negative visual read and a positive quantitative result, the \n\nreference region should be inspected and where any concerns on ROI placement accuracy or \n\nreduced uptake are evident, an alternative region should be used (the software may allow for a \n\nnumber of different reference regions). Further, the placement of the cortical ROIs should be \n\nchecked to determine if white matter is sampled, which may increase quantitation values. \n\n \n\n4. A final interpretation of the PET image should be made on the basis of the visual read having \nconducted the review outlined in steps 1 to 3.    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nLimitations of use \n\nA positive scan does not independently establish a diagnosis of AD or other cognitive disorder since \n\nneuritic plaque deposition in grey matter may be present in asymptomatic elderly patients and some \n\nneurodegenerative dementias (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but also Lewy body dementia and Parkinson\u2019s \n\ndisease dementia). \n\n \n\nFor the limitations of use in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), see section 5.1. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of flutemetamol (18F) for predicting development of AD or monitoring response to \n\ntherapy has not been established (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nSome scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon or \n\nimage blur, which could lead to interpretation errors. For cases in which there is uncertainty about the \n\nlocation of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border on the PET scan, and a co-registered recent \n\nCT or MR image is available, the interpreter should examine the fused PET-CT or PET-MR image to \n\nclarify the relationship of the PET radioactivity and the grey matter anatomy. \n\n \n\nAfter the procedure  \n\nClose contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the initial 24 hours \n\nfollowing the injection. \n\n \n\nSpecific warnings  \n\nThis medicinal product contains (7 vol %) of ethanol (alcohol), i.e. up to 552 mg (approximately \n\n0.7 mL) per dose. This amount may be harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. To be taken into \n\naccount in pregnant or breast-feeding women and high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease \n\nor epilepsy. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains up to 41 mg (or 1.8 mmol) sodium per dose,equivalent to 2 % of the \n\nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. This may need to be taken into \n\nconsideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.  \n\n \n\nFor precautions with respect to environmental hazard see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nPharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed in patients to establish the \n\nextent, if any, to which concomitant medicinal products may alter VIZAMYL image results. \n\n \n\nNo in vivo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\nIn vitro binding studies have not shown interference of flutemetamol (18F) binding to \u03b2-amyloid \n\nplaques in the presence of other common medicinal products taken by AD patients. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is \n\nimportant to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be \n\nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the \n\nwoman has missed a period, if the period is irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising \n\nradiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nPregnancy \n\nNo studies have been conducted in pregnant women. No animal studies have been conducted to \n\ninvestigate the reproductive effects of flutemetamol (18F) (see section 5.3). \n\nRadionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. \n\nOnly essential investigations should therefore be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit \n\nfar exceeds the risk incurred by the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether flutemetamol (18F) is excreted in human milk during breast-feeding. Before \n\nadministering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given \n\nto the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breast-\n\nfeeding, and to the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of \n\nactivity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be \n\ninterrupted for 24 hours and the expressed feeds discarded. \n\n \n\nClose contact with infants should be restricted during the initial 24 hours following injection. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo studies on fertility have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nVIZAMYL has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nHowever, VIZAMYL may cause transient dizziness and vertigo. Therefore, following the \n\nadministration of VIZAMYL, patients are advised not to drive, operate complex machinery or engage \n\nin other potentially hazardous activities until these effects have completely disappeared.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\nThe overall safety profile of VIZAMYL is based on data from its administrations to 831 subjects.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe frequencies of adverse reactions are defined as follows: \n\nVery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 \n\nto <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions are listed in the Table 1 below: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nTable 1  List of adverse reactions \n\nSystem Organ Class Common  Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders   Anaphylactoid reaction \n\nPsychiatric disorders   Anxiety \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n \n\n  Dizziness \n\n Headache \n\n Hypoaesthesia \n\n Hypotonia \n\n Dysgeusia \n\n Tremor \n\nEye disorders   Eye swelling \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders   Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders   Palpitations \n\nVascular disorders Flushing  Pallor \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\n  Dyspnoea \n\n Hyperventilation \n\n Throat irritation \n\nGastrointestinal disorders   Nausea  \n\n Vomiting \n\n Dyspepsia \n\n Abdominal discomfort \n\n Oral discomfort  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  Facial hypoaesthesia \n\n Pruritus \n\n Rash \n\n Skin tightness \n\n Swelling face \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders \n\n  Back pain \n\n Muscle tightness \n\n Musculoskeletal pain \n\nReproductive system and \n\nbreast disorders \n\n  Erectile dysfunction \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\n  Chest discomfort \n\n Feeling hot \n\n Asthenia \n\n Fatigue \n\n Feeling abnormal \n\n Feeling cold \n\n Infusion site pain \n\n Oedema \n\n Pyrexia \n\nInvestigations Increased blood \n\npressure \n\n Blood glucose decreased \n\n Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased \n\n Neutrophil count increased \n\n Respiratory rate increased \n\n \n\nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \n\nhereditary defects. The effective dose is approximately 5.9 mSv when the maximal recommended \n\nactivity of 185 MBq of flutemetamol (18F) is administered. These adverse events are expected to occur \n\nwith low probability. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nThe following adverse reactions may occur as symptoms and signs of a hypersensitivity reaction to \n\nVIZAMYL or any of its excipients (see section 6.1): eye/face swelling, pallor, dyspnoea, throat \n\nirritation, vomiting, rash, pruritus, skin tightness, chest tightness (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nDue to the small quantity of flutemetamol (18F) in each dose, overdose is not expected to result in \n\npharmacological effects. In the event of administration of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to \n\nthe patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from \n\nthe body by frequent micturition and defecation. It might be helpful to estimate the effective dose that \n\nwas applied. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, central nervous system, \n\nATC code: V09AX04  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nFlutemetamol (18F) binds to \u03b2-amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain.  \n\nIn vitro, flutemetamol (18F) binds to \u03b2-amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain, with negligible binding to \n\nneurofibrillary tangles. Data suggest that flutemetamol (18F) is able to label cored and diffuse amyloid \n\n\u03b2 deposits and neuritic plaques. There is no evidence of flutemetamol (18F) binding to soluble forms of \n\nAbeta. \n\n \n\nIn vivo, quantitative correlation was assessed in end-of-life patients between flutemetamol (18F) uptake \n\nin cortical grey matter and the total \u03b2-amyloid burden in autopsied samples using 4G8 anti-amyloid \n\nantibody that stains \u03b2-amyloid found in both neuritic and diffuse plaques. In vivo, flutemetamol (18F) \n\ncan detect \u03b2-amyloid diffuse plaques when they are frequent. The in vivo binding of flutemetamol \n\n(18F) to other \u03b2-amyloid structures or other brain structures or receptors remains unknown. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nAt the low concentrations present in VIZAMYL, flutemetamol (18F) has no detectable \n\npharmacodynamic activity. \n\n \n\nBrain uptake and distribution of flutemetamol (18F) were not evaluated in a specific study aimed to \n\nevaluate pharmacodynamics. In two similar studies of biodistribution and a phase II clinical study, \n\nmean quantitative uptake values in PET images differed between pAD and HV subjects in most \n\nexamined areas of the brain. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nA pivotal study in 68 end-of-life patients was aimed at establishing the diagnostic performance of \n\nflutemetamol (18F) to detect the cortical neuritic plaque density. The PET results were compared with \n\nthe neuritic plaque density measured on sections of eight predefined brain regions at the patient\u2019s \n\nautopsy. The histopathology regions included, but were not restricted to the CERAD regions. The \n\ncognitive status of the patients was not determined. In the 68 patients, a blinded visual patient-level \n\nPET read by 5 blinded readers resulted in a majority read sensitivity of 86% (95% CI: 72% to 95%) \n\nand specificity 92% (95% CI: 74% to 99%).  \n\n \n\nSensitivity and specificity to estimate \u03b2-amyloid deposition of flutemetamol (18F) was further \n\ninvestigated in one additional study, in which a different set of 5 electronically-trained blinded readers \n\ninterpreted images from the same 68 patients followed to autopsy in the pivotal study. Histopathology \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nfrom the pivotal study was used. The majority read sensitivity and specificity were 93% \n\n(95% CI: 81% to 99%) and 84% (95% CI: 64% to 96%), respectively.  \n\n \n\nIn a re-reading study that increased the patient population of the pivotal study to include 38 additional \n\nautopsied patients (i.e., 106 in total), sensitivity and specificity for detection of moderate-frequent \u03b2-\n\namyloid neuritic plaque density in the primary analysis were 91% (95% CI: 82% to 96%) and 90% \n\n(95% CI: 74% to 98%), respectively, based on the majority read (i.e., the image interpretation reached \n\nby at least 3 of the 5 readers after electronic training). In a secondary analysis that used a standard of \n\ntruth based on the region of maximum neuritic plaque involvement in the 3 neocortical regions \n\noriginally recommended by CERAD, sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 83% to 97%), and specificity was \n\n88% (95% CI: 71% to 97%). \n\n \n\nIn a longitudinal study, 232 patients clinically diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment \n\n(aMCI), underwent baseline flutemetamol (18F) PET scans, and were followed for 36 months to \n\nevaluate the relationship between flutemetamol (18F) imaging and changes in diagnostic status. \n\n98 (42%) of the 232 patients had abnormal (positive) flutemetamol (18F) scans. Of the 232 patients \n\nenrolled, 224 had at least one post-scan review by the independent committee and were included in the \n\nanalysis. At the 36-month follow-up, 81 (35%) converted to clinical AD. Of the 97 aMCI patients who \n\nhad a positive PET scan and at least one committee assessment, 52 (54%) were classified clinically as \n\nconverted to clinical AD after 36 months compared to 29 (23%) of 127 who had a negative scan and at \n\nleast one committee assessment. At 36 months, sensitivity of flutemetamol (18F) scans for predicting \n\nconversion from aMCI to AD in 81 converters was 64 % (95% CI: 54% to 75 %), specificity in 143 \n\nnon-converters was 69% (95% CI: 60% to 76 %). Based on the majority read, the positive and \n\nnegative likelihood ratios were 2.04 and 0.52 respectively. The design of this study does not allow \n\nestimating the risk of MCI progression to clinical AD.  \n\n \n\n \n\nClinical Studies demonstrating adjunctive use of quantitative information for image interpretation \n\n \n\nThe reliability of using quantitative information as an adjunct to visual inspection was analysed in two \n\nclinical studies where the concordance between the two methods of image interpretation were \n\ncompared. In both studies (total n=379) CE marked amyloid quantitation software was used and the % \n\nagreement between visual reads and quantitation was 98.8% to 99%. In study one, the thresholds for \n\namyloid quantitation were calculated against post-mortem confirmation of brain amyloid status as the \n\nstandard of truth (from pivotal clinical autopsy cohort n=68) and a healthy cohort of n=105 volunteers \n\nused to define the reference range for normal quantitative measures. The derived thresholds were used \n\nto categorise a test cohort of 172 scans (33 probable AD, 80 amnestic MCI and 59 healthy volunteers) \n\nas negative or positive and compared to categorisation by visual read. Agreement was 98.8% (170/172 \n\nscans).  \n\nIn the second study, to investigate the impact of amyloid PET with flutemetamol (18F) on diagnosis \n\nand treatment management in a cohort of patients attending a tertiary memory clinic, 207 patients had \n\nimages interpreted by visual inspection or CE marked software with an agreement of 99% (205/207 \n\nscans) between the two methods.. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nflutemetamol (18F) in all subsets of the paediatric population as the disease or condition for which the \n\nspecific medicinal product is intended only occurs in adults (see section 4.2 for information on \n\npaediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFlutemetamol (18F) is distributed throughout the body within several minutes of injection. After \n\n20 minutes approximately 20 % of the active compound flutemetamol (18F) remains in the circulation, \n\nfalling to 10 % at 180 minutes. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nOrgan uptake \n\nMaximal flutemetamol (18F) brain uptake of approximately 7% of an injected dose occurs within two \n\nminutes of administration. This is followed by rapid clearance from the brain in the first 90 minutes \n\n(the recommended time to start scanning), followed by more gradual clearance. The five \n\norgans/tissues with the highest cumulated activities were the wall of the small intestines, liver, urinary \n\nbladder wall, wall of the upper large intestine and the wall of the gallbladder. \n\n \n\nHealthy controls show low levels of flutemetamol (18F) retention in cerebral cortex. The highest level \n\nof uptake is in pons and other white matter regions. In AD patients, cortical regions and striatal \n\nregions show significantly greater uptake compared to cortical regions in controls. In AD patients, as \n\nin controls, there is high retention in pons and other white matter areas. \n\n \n\nThe biophysical basis of the white matter retention of flutemetamol (18F) in the living human brain has \n\nnot been definitively explained. It is hypothesized that solubility of the radiopharmaceutical in the \n\nlipid content of brain tissues may contribute to white matter retention. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nElimination and half-Life \n\nFlutemetamol (18F) is rapidly cleared from circulation (through the intestinal and urinary tracts). At \n\n20 minutes post-injection, 75% of the radioactivity in plasma was present as polar metabolites. At \n\n180 minutes, 90% of the radioactivity was present in plasma in the form of polar metabolites. \n\nElimination of flutemetamol (18F) is approximately 37% renal and 52% hepatobiliary. The apparent \n\nelimination half-life is 4.5 hours whereas the radioactive half-life of flutemetamol (18F) is 110 minutes. \n\n \n\nRenal/hepatic impairment  \n\nThe pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been characterised. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology and repeated dose toxicity. \n\n \n\nFlutemetamol (18F) was positive in in vitro genotoxicity tests in bacteria and mammalian cells but \n\nnegative in three different in vivo studies with sufficiently high doses. Any clinically relevant \n\nmutagenic potential is therefore considered highly unlikely. \n\n \n\nNo carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicology studies have been performed with flutemetamol (18F). \n\n \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n \n\nSodium chloride \n\nEthanol, anhydrous \n\nPolysorbate 80 \n\nSodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate \n\nDisodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate \n\nWater for injections \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \n\nproducts. \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nEight hours from the reference date and time.  \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n\nStorage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive \n\nmaterials. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL is supplied in 10-mL and 15-mL Type I glass vials with halobutyl rubber stoppers and \n\naluminium seals. \n\nAs a result of the manufacturing process some vials are distributed with punctured rubber stoppers. \n\n \n\nPack size \n\nOne multidose vial of 10-mL capacity contains 1 to 10 mL of solution, corresponding to 400 to \n\n4000 MBq at reference date and time. \n\nOne multidose vial of 15-mL capacity contains 1 to 15 mL of solution, corresponding to 400 to \n\n6000 MBq at reference date and time. \n\n \n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nWithdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before \n\ndisinfecting the stopper. The solution should then be withdrawn via the stopper, using either a  \n\nsingle-dose syringe fitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle, or an \n\nauthorised automated application system. If the integrity of the vial is compromised, the medicinal \n\nproduct should not be used. \n\n \n\nGeneral warning \n\nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \n\ndesignated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the \n\nregulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation. \n\n \n\nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner that satisfies both radiation safety and \n\npharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL is a radioactive medicinal product that emits positrons, which annihilate with electrons to \n\nproduce gamma rays, and must be handled with safety measures to minimise radiation exposure to \n\nclinical personnel and patients. VIZAMYL should be used by, or under the control of, physicians who \n\nare qualified by specific training and experienced in the safe use and handling of radionuclides, and \n\nwhose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorised \n\nto license the use of radiopharmaceuticals. To minimise radiation dose to the bladder, hydration before \n\nand after VIZAMYL administration should be encouraged in order to permit frequent voiding. The \n\npatient should be encouraged to void prior to and following imaging with VIZAMYL, and frequently \n\nthereafter for the next 24 hours. \n\n \n\nIf at any time in the preparation of this product the integrity of the vial is compromised, it should not \n\nbe used. \n\n \n\nAdministration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the \n\nmedicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nThe administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \n\ncontamination from spills of urine, vomiting etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with \n\nnational regulations must be taken. \n\n \n\nDisposal \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements.  \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nVIZAMYL 400 MBq/mL solution for injection \n\nflutemetamol (18F) \n\n \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise your \n\nprocedure. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What VIZAMYL is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before VIZAMYL is used \n\n3. How VIZAMYL is used \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How VIZAMYL is stored \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What VIZAMYL is and what it is used for \n \n\nVIZAMYL contains the active substance flutemetamol (18F) )and is used to help diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndisease and other causes of memory loss.  \n\nThis medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL is used to help diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other causes of memory loss. It is given \n\nto adults with memory problems before they undergo a type of brain scan called a positron-emission \n\ntomography (PET) scan. This scan, along with other brain function tests, can help your doctor \n\ndetermine whether or not you may have \u03b2-amyloid plaques in your brain. \u03b2-Amyloid plaques are \n\ndeposits sometimes present in the brains of people with dementias (such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease).  \n\n \n\nYou should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. \n\n \n\nThe use of VIZAMYL involves exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the \n\nnuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of this procedure with the \n\nradiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to these small amounts of radiation. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before VIZAMYL is used \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL must not be used: \n- If you are allergic to flutemetamol (18F) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given VIZAMYL if you: \n\n- have kidney problems \n- have liver problems \n- are pregnant or think you may be pregnant \n- are breast-feeding \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nVIZAMYL is not intended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years old. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and VIZAMYL \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines since they may interfere with the images obtained from the brain scan. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before you are given VIZAMYL if there is a possibility \n\nyou might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. When in doubt, it \n\nis important to consult the nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant \n\nThe nuclear medicine doctor will only give this medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected \n\nwhich would outweigh the risks.  \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding \n\nYou must stop breast-feeding for 24 hours after the injection. Express the breast milk during this \n\nperiod and discard any breast milk you have expressed. Resuming breast-feeding should be in \n\nagreement with the nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  \n\n \n\nYou should avoid any close contact with young children for 24 hours following the injection. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nVIZAMYL may cause transient dizziness or vertigo, which may affect your ability to drive or use \n\nmachines. You should not drive, use machines or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until \n\nthese effects have completely disappeared. \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL contains alcohol (ethanol) and sodium \n\nVIZAMYL contains alcohol (ethanol). Each dose contains up to 552 mg alcohol. This is about the \n\nsame as 14 mL of beer or 6 mL of wine. This could be harmful for people with alcoholism and needs \n\nto be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women and people with liver problems or \n\nepilepsy. \n\n \n\nVIZAMYL contains a maximum of 41 mg of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each \n\ndose. This is equivalent to approximately 2% of the adult recommended maximum daily dietary intake \n\nfor sodium  These amounts may need to be considered for people on a low sodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How VIZAMYL will be used \n\n \n\nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. \n\nVIZAMYL will only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given \n\nto you by professionals who are trained and qualified to use it safely. They will provide you with the \n\nnecessary information on the procedure. \n\n \n\nYour nuclear medicine doctor may ask you to drink plenty of water before the start of the examination \n\nand the 24 hours after the study in order to urinate as often as possible to help remove it from your \n\nbody faster.  \n \n\nDose \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of VIZAMYL to be \n\nused in your case. The doctor will choose the smallest amount necessary.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nThe usual amount recommended for an adult is 185 MBq. Megabecquerel (MBq) is the unit used to \n\nmeasure radioactivity. \n\n \n\nAdministration of VIZAMYL and conduct of the procedure \n\nVIZAMYL is given as an injection into your vein (intravenous injection) followed by a flush of \n\nsodium chloride solution to ensure full delivery of the dose. \n\n \n\nOne injection is sufficient to carry out the scan that your doctor needs. \n\n \n\nDuration of the procedure \n\nA brain scan is usually taken 90 minutes after VIZAMYL is given. Your nuclear medicine doctor will \n\ninform you about the usual duration of the procedure.  \n\n \n\nAfter administration of VIZAMYL \nYou should avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for 24 hours following \n\nthe injection. \n\n \n\nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after \n\nreceiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. \n\n \n\nIf you have received more VIZAMYL than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely since you will only receive a single dose of VIZAMYL from the nuclear \n\nmedicine doctor under controlled conditions. \n\n \n\nHowever, in the case of an overdose, you would receive the appropriate treatment. Treatment consists \n\nof increasing the passing of urine and stools in order to help remove radioactivity from your body. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor \n\nwho supervises the procedure. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nThe following side effects may happen with this medicine: \n\n \n\nSerious side effects \n\nTell your doctor straight away, if you notice any of the following, as you may need urgent medical \n\ntreatment: \n\n- Allergic reactions - the signs may include swelling of your face or eyes, having pale, itchy or \ntight skin or having a rash, feeling short of breath, tightness in the chest, irritation in your throat \n\nor being sick.
