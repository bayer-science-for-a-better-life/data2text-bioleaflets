NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nHerceptin 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial contains 150 mg of trastuzumab, a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by \nmammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cell suspension culture and purified by affinity and ion exchange \nchromatography including specific viral inactivation and removal procedures.  \n \nThe reconstituted Herceptin solution contains 21 mg/mL of trastuzumab. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nWhite to pale yellow lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nMetastatic breast cancer  \n \nHerceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer: \n(MBC): \n \n- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy \n\nregimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an \nanthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor \npositive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these \ntreatments. \n\n \n- in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. \n \n- in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease. \n \n- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with \n\nhormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab.  \n \nEarly breast cancer  \n \nHerceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer. \n(EBC). \n \n- following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with \npaclitaxel or docetaxel. \n\n \n- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin.  \n \n- in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Herceptin therapy, for \n\nlocally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \nHerceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have \neither HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated \nassay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nHerceptin in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the \ntreatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-\nesophageal junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. \n \nHerceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have \nHER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ \nresult. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Herceptin treatment \nshould only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(see section 4.4), and should be administered by a healthcare professional only. \n \nIt is important to check the product labels to ensure that the correct formulation (intravenous or \nsubcutaneous fixed dose) is being administered to the patient, as prescribed. Herceptin intravenous \nformulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be administered via an \nintravenous infusion only.  \n \nSwitching treatment between Herceptin intravenous and Herceptin subcutaneous formulations and \nvice versa, using the three-weekly (q3w) dosing regimen, was investigated in study MO22982 (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug \nbeing prepared and administered is Herceptin (trastuzumab) and not Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine). \n \nPosology  \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nThree-weekly schedule \n \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose \nat three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nWeekly schedule \n \nThe recommended initial loading dose of Herceptin is 4 mg/kg body weight. The recommended \nweekly maintenance dose of Herceptin is 2 mg/kg body weight, beginning one week after the loading \ndose. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAdministration in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel  \n \nIn the pivotal trials (H0648g, M77001), paclitaxel or docetaxel was administered the day following the \nfirst dose of Herceptin (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for paclitaxel or \ndocetaxel) and immediately after the subsequent doses of Herceptin if the preceding dose of Herceptin \nwas well tolerated. \n \nAdministration in combination with an aromatase inhibitor \n \nIn the pivotal trial (BO16216) Herceptin and anastrozole were administered from day 1. There were no \nrestrictions on the relative timing of Herceptin and anastrozole at administration (for dose, see the \nSmPC for anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors). \n \nEarly breast cancer  \n \nThree-weekly and weekly schedule \n \nAs a three-weekly regimen the recommended initial loading dose of Herceptin is 8 mg/kg body \nweight. The recommended maintenance dose of Herceptin at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body \nweight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \nAs a weekly regimen (initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg every week) concomitantly \nwith paclitaxel following chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nSee section 5.1 for chemotherapy combination dosing. \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nThree-weekly schedule \n \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose \nat three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nBreast cancer and gastric cancer  \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nPatients with MBC or MGC should be treated with Herceptin until progression of disease.  \nPatients with EBC should be treated with Herceptin for 1 year or until disease recurrence, whichever \noccurs first; extending treatment in EBC beyond one year is not recommended (see section 5.1).  \n \nDose reduction \n \nNo reductions in the dose of Herceptin were made during clinical trials. Patients may continue therapy \nduring periods of reversible, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression but they should be monitored \ncarefully for complications of neutropenia during this time. Refer to the SmPC for paclitaxel, \ndocetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose reduction or delays. \n \nIf left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) percentage drops ≥ 10 points from baseline AND to below \n50 %, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately \n3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or has declined further, or if symptomatic congestive heart failure \n(CHF) has developed, discontinuation of Herceptin should be strongly considered, unless the benefits \nfor the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMissed doses \n \nIf the patient has missed a dose of Herceptin by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose \n(weekly regimen: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as \npossible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent maintenance doses   should be \nadministered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules, respectively.   \n \nIf the patient has missed a dose of Herceptin by more than one week, a re-loading dose of Herceptin \nshould be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly regimen: 4 mg/kg; three-weekly \nregimen: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent Herceptin maintenance doses (weekly regimen: \n2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen 6 mg/kg respectively) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later \naccording to the weekly or three-weekly schedules respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nDedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have not \nbeen carried out. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age and renal impairment were not shown \nto affect trastuzumab disposition. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Herceptin in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHerceptin loading dose should be administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. Do not administer \nas an intravenous push or bolus. Herceptin intravenous infusion should be administered by a health-\ncare provider prepared to manage anaphylaxis and an emergency kit should be available. Patients \nshould be observed for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours after the \nstart of the subsequent infusions for symptoms like fever and chills or other infusion-related symptoms \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Interruption or slowing the rate of the infusion may help control such \nsymptoms. The infusion may be resumed when symptoms abate. \n \nIf the initial loading dose was well tolerated, the subsequent doses can be administered as a 30-minute \ninfusion. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Herceptin intravenous formulation before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n∑ Hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n∑ Severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring supplementary \n\noxygen therapy. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of \nthe testing procedures (see section 5.1). \n \nCurrently no data from clinical trials are available on re-treatment of patients with previous exposure \nto Herceptin in the adjuvant setting. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nCardiac dysfunction  \n \nGeneral considerations \n \nPatients treated with Herceptin are at increased risk for developing CHF (New York Heart Association \n[NYHA] Class II-IV) or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. These events have been observed in \npatients receiving Herceptin therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, particularly \nfollowing anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) containing chemotherapy. These may be moderate \nto severe and have been associated with death (see section 4.8). In addition, caution should be \nexercised in treating patients with increased cardiac risk, e.g. hypertension, documented coronary \nartery disease, CHF, LVEF of <55%, older age. \n \nAll candidates for treatment with Herceptin, but especially those with prior anthracycline and \ncyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and \nphysical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or multigated acquisition \n(MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop \ncardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 months \nduring treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months from the \nlast administration of Herceptin. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be made before deciding to \ntreat with Herceptin.  \n \nTrastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months after stopping Herceptin treatment \nbased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of all available data (see section 5.2). Patients who \nreceive anthracyclines after stopping Herceptin may possibly be at increased risk of cardiac \ndysfunction. If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after \nstopping Herceptin. If anthracyclines are used, the patient’s cardiac function should be monitored \ncarefully. \n  \nFormal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular \nconcerns following baseline screening. In all patients cardiac function should be monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every 12 weeks). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac \ndysfunction. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more frequent \nmonitoring (e.g. every 6 - 8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular function, \nbut remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of \nHerceptin therapy has been seen.  \n \nThe safety of continuation or resumption of Herceptin in patients who experience cardiac dysfunction \nhas not been prospectively studied. If LVEF percentage drops ≥10 points from baseline AND to below \n50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately 3 \nweeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, or symptomatic CHF has developed, \ndiscontinuation of Herceptin should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the individual \npatient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for assessment by a \ncardiologist and followed up. \n \nIf symptomatic cardiac failure develops during Herceptin therapy, it should be treated with standard \nmedicinal products for CHF. Most patients who developed CHF or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction \nin pivotal trials improved with standard CHF treatment consisting of an angiotensin-converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a beta-blocker. The majority of \npatients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of Herceptin treatment continued on \ntherapy without additional clinical cardiac events. \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nHerceptin and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the MBC setting.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPatients with MBC who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiac dysfunction \nwith Herceptin treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of Herceptin and \nanthracyclines. \n \nEarly breast cancer  \n \nFor patients with EBC, cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 \nmonths during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months \nfrom the last administration of Herceptin. In patients who receive anthracycline-containing \nchemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the last \nadministration of Herceptin, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. \n \nPatients with history of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, \nhistory of or existing CHF (NYHA Class II –IV), LVEF of < 55%, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac \narrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, poorly \ncontrolled hypertension (hypertension controlled by standard medical treatment eligible), and \nhemodynamic effective pericardial effusion were excluded from adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC \npivotal trials with Herceptin and therefore treatment cannot be recommended in such patients. \n \nAdjuvant treatment \n \nHerceptin and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the adjuvant \ntreatment setting. \n \nIn patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events \nwas observed when Herceptin was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy \ncompared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was \nmore marked when Herceptin was administered concurrently with taxanes than when administered \nsequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred \nwithin the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a median follow-up of \n5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous increase in the cumulative rate of symptomatic \ncardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with \na taxane following anthracycline therapy up to 2.37% compared to approximately 1% in the two \ncomparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin \nand Herceptin). \n \nRisk factors for a cardiac event identified in four large adjuvant studies included advanced age \n(> 50 years), low LVEF (<55%) at baseline, prior to or following the initiation of paclitaxel treatment, \ndecline in LVEF by 10-15 points, and prior or concurrent use of anti-hypertensive medicinal products. \nIn patients receiving Herceptin after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the risk of cardiac \ndysfunction was associated with a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline given prior to initiation of \nHerceptin and a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2. \n \nNeoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment \n \nIn patients with EBC eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, Herceptin should be used \nconcurrently with anthracyclines only in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose \nanthracycline regimens i.e. maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or epirubicin \n360 mg/m2. \n \nIf patients have been treated concurrently with a full course of low-dose anthracyclines and Herceptin \nin the neoadjuvant setting, no additional cytotoxic chemotherapy should be given after surgery. In \nother situations, the decision on the need for additional cytotoxic chemotherapy is determined based \non individual factors. \n \nExperience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with low dose anthracycline regimens is \ncurrently limited to two trials (MO16432 and BO22227).  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nIn the pivotal trial MO16432, Herceptin was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy containing three cycles of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 180 mg/m2 ) .  \n \nThe incidence of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 1.7% in the Herceptin arm .  \n \nThe pivotal trial BO22227 was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with Herceptin \nsubcutaneous formulation versus treatment with Herceptin intravenous formulation based on co-\nprimary PK and efficacy endpoints (trastuzumab Ctrough at pre-dose Cycle 8, and pCR rate at definitive \nsurgery, respectively) (See Section 5.1. of Herceptin subcutaneous formulation SmPC).  In the pivotal \ntrial BO22227, Herceptin was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant chemotherapy that \ncontained four cycles of epirubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m2); at a median follow-up exceeding 70 \nmonths, the incidence of cardiac failure/congestive cardiac failure was 0.3% in the Herceptin \nintravenous arm. \n \nClinical experience is limited in patients above 65 years of age. \n \nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs) and hypersensitivity \n \nSerious IRRs to Herceptin infusion including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, \nbronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory \ndistress, urticaria and angioedema have been reported (see section 4.8). Pre-medication may be used to \nreduce risk of occurrence of these events. The majority of these events occur during or within 2.5 \nhours of the start of the first infusion.  Should an infusion reaction occur the infusion should be \ndiscontinued or the rate of infusion slowed and the patient should be monitored until resolution of all \nobserved symptoms (see section 4.2). These symptoms can be treated with an analgesic/antipyretic \nsuch as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. The majority of \npatients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of Herceptin. \nSerious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-\nagonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions are associated with a clinical course \nculminating in a fatal outcome. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of \nadvanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction. \nTherefore, these patients should not be treated with Herceptin (see section 4.3). \n \nInitial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical \ndeterioration have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week \nfollowing infusion. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion symptoms \nand pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the Herceptin infusion. Patients should \nbe warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their physician if \nthese symptoms occur. \n \nPulmonary events \n \nSevere pulmonary events have been reported with the use of Herceptin in the post-marketing setting \n(see section 4.8). These events have occasionally been fatal. In addition, cases of interstitial lung \ndisease including lung infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, \npleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been \nreported. Risk factors associated with interstitial lung disease include prior or concomitant therapy \nwith other anti-neoplastic therapies known to be associated with it such as taxanes, gemcitabine, \nvinorelbine and radiation therapy. These events may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction or \nwith a delayed onset. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced \nmalignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, these patients \nshould not be treated with Herceptin (see section 4.3).  Caution should be exercised for pneumonitis, \nespecially in patients being treated concomitantly with taxanes.  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between \nHerceptin and the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed.  \n \nEffect of trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \n \nPharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC \nsuggested that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites 6-α hydroxyl-\npaclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) was not altered in the presence of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg or \n4 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w or 2 mg/kg q1w IV, respectively). \nHowever, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one doxorubicin metabolite, (7-deoxy-13 \ndihydro-doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the clinical impact of the elevation of this \nmetabolite was unclear.   \n \nData from study JP16003, a single-arm study of Herceptin (4 mg/kg IV loading dose and 2 mg/kg IV \nweekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 IV) in Japanese women with HER2- positive MBC, suggested that \nconcomitant administration of Herceptin had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of \ndocetaxel. Study JP19959 was a substudy of BO18255 (ToGA) performed in male and female \nJapanese patients with advanced gastric cancer to study the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and \ncisplatin when used with or without Herceptin. The results of this substudy suggested that the \nexposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine was not affected by concurrent use of \ncisplatin or by concurrent use of cisplatin plus Herceptin. However, capecitabine itself showed higher \nconcentrations and a longer half-life when combined with Herceptin. The data also suggested that the \npharmacokinetics of cisplatin were not affected by concurrent use of capecitabine or by concurrent use \nof capecitabine plus Herceptin. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced \ninoperable HER2-positive cancer suggested that trastuzumab had no impact on the PK of carboplatin.  \n \nEffect of antineoplastic agents on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics \n \nBy comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after Herceptin monotherapy (4 mg/kg \nloading/2 mg/kg q1w IV) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women with HER2- positive \nMBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration of docetaxel on the \npharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. \n \nComparison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase III study \n(H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with Herceptin and paclitaxel and two Phase II \nstudies in which Herceptin was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and MO16982),  in women \nwith HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab trough serum \nconcentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant \nadministration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of trastuzumab PK \ndata from Study M77004 in which women with HER2-positive MBC were treated concomitantly with \nHerceptin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin to trastuzumab PK data in studies where Herceptin was \nadministered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide \nor paclitaxel (Study H0648g), suggested no effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel on the \npharmacokinetics of trastuzumab.  \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 suggested that carboplatin had no impact on the \nPK of trastuzumab. \n \nThe administration of concomitant anastrozole did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith Herceptin and for 7 months after treatment has concluded (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nReproduction studies have been conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of the \nweekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg Herceptin intravenous formulation and have revealed no \nevidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus. Placental transfer of trastuzumab during the early \n(days 20–50 of gestation) and late (days 120–150 of gestation) foetal development period was \nobserved. It is not known whether Herceptin can affect reproductive capacity. As animal reproduction \nstudies are not always predictive of human response, Herceptin should be avoided during pregnancy \nunless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, cases of foetal renal growth and/or function impairment in association \nwith oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the foetus, have been \nreported in pregnant women receiving Herceptin. Women who become pregnant should be advised of \nthe possibility of harm to the foetus. If a pregnant woman is treated with Herceptin, or if a patient \nbecomes pregnant while receiving Herceptin or within 7 months following the last dose of Herceptin, \nclose monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is desirable. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nA study conducted in lactating Cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human \nmaintenance dose of 2 mg/kg Herceptin intravenous formulation demonstrated that trastuzumab is \nsecreted in the milk. The presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not associated \nwith any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. It is not known \nwhether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk. As human IgG1 is secreted into human milk, and the \npotential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed during Herceptin therapy \nand for 7 months after the last dose. \n \nFertility  \n \nThere is no fertility data available.   \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHerceptin has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Dizziness \nand somnolence may occur during treatment with Herceptin (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing \ninfusion-related symptoms (see section 4.4) should be advised not to drive and use machines until \nsymptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAmongst the most serious and/or common adverse reactions reported in Herceptin usage (intravenous \nand subcutaneous formulations) to date are cardiac dysfunction, infusion-related reactions, \nhaematotoxicity (in particular neutropenia), infections and pulmonary adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn this section, the following categories of frequency have been used: very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n\n\n\n11 \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nPresented in Table 1 are adverse reactions that have been reported in association with the use of \nintravenous Herceptin alone or in combination with chemotherapy in pivotal clinical trials and in the \npost-marketing setting.  \n \nAll the terms included are based on the highest percentage seen in pivotal clinical trials.

Specific \npercentages for these are not available. \n* Observed with combination therapy following anthracyclines and combined with taxanes \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac dysfunction \n \nCongestive heart failure (NYHA Class II – IV) is a common adverse reaction associated with the use \nof Herceptin and has been associated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). Signs and symptoms of \ncardiac dysfunction such as dyspnoea, orthopnoea, increased cough, pulmonary oedema, S3 gallop, or \nreduced ventricular ejection fraction, have been observed in patients treated with Herceptin (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn 3 pivotal clinical trials of adjuvant Herceptin given in combination with chemotherapy, the \nincidence of grade 3/4 cardiac dysfunction (specifically symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure) was \nsimilar in patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (ie did not receive Herceptin) and in \npatients who were administered Herceptin sequentially after a taxane (0.3-0.4 %). The rate was highest \nin patients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane (2.0 %). In the neoadjuvant \nsetting, the experience of concurrent administration of Herceptin and low dose anthracycline regimen \nis limited (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen Herceptin was administered after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy NYHA Class III-IV \nheart failure was observed in 0.6 % of patients in the one-year arm after a median follow-up of 12 \nmonths.  In study BO16348, after a median follow-up of 8 years the incidence of severe CHF (NYHA \nClass III & IV) in the Herceptin 1 year treatment arm was 0.8 %, and the rate of mild symptomatic and \nasymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was 4.6 %. \n \nReversibility of severe CHF (defined as a sequence of at least two consecutive LVEF values ≥50 % \nafter the event) was evident for 71.4 % of Herceptin-treated patients. Reversibility of mild \nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated for 79.5 % of patients. \nApproximately 17 % of cardiac dysfunction related events occurred after completion of Herceptin. \n \nIn the pivotal metastatic trials of intravenous Herceptin, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction varied \nbetween 9 % and 12 % when it was combined with paclitaxel compared with 1 % – 4 % for paclitaxel \nalone. For monotherapy, the rate was 6 % – 9 %. The highest rate of cardiac dysfunction was seen in \npatients receiving Herceptin concurrently with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (27 %), and was \nsignificantly higher than for anthracycline/cyclophosphamide alone (7 % – 10 %). In a subsequent trial \nwith prospective monitoring of cardiac function, the incidence of symptomatic CHF was 2.2 % in \npatients receiving Herceptin and docetaxel, compared with 0 % in patients receiving docetaxel alone. \n\n\n\n15 \n\nMost of the patients (79 %) who developed cardiac dysfunction in these trials experienced an \nimprovement after receiving standard treatment for CHF. \n  \nInfusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity \n \nIt is estimated that approximately 40 % of patients who are treated with Herceptin will experience \nsome form of infusion-related reaction. However, the majority of infusion-related reactions are mild to \nmoderate in intensity (NCI-CTC grading system) and tend to occur earlier in treatment, i.e. during \ninfusions one, two and three and lessen in frequency in subsequent infusions. Reactions include chills, \nfever, dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, \nrespiratory distress, rash, nausea, vomiting and headache (see section 4.4). The rate of infusion-related \nreactions of all grades varied between studies depending on the indication, the data collection \nmethodology, and whether trastuzumab was given concurrently with chemotherapy or as \nmonotherapy. \n \nSevere anaphylactic reactions requiring immediate additional intervention can occur usually during \neither the first or second infusion of Herceptin (see section 4.4) and have been associated with a fatal \noutcome.  \n \nAnaphylactoid reactions have been observed in isolated cases. \n \nHaematotoxicity \n \nFebrile neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred very \ncommonly. The frequency of occurrence of hypoprothrombinemia is not known. The risk of \nneutropenia may be slightly increased when trastuzumab is administered with docetaxel following \nanthracycline therapy. \n \nPulmonary events \n \nSevere pulmonary adverse reactions occur in association with the use of Herceptin and have been \nassociated with a fatal outcome. These include, but are not limited to, pulmonary infiltrates, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute \npulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \nDetails of risk minimisation measures that are consistent with the EU Risk Management Plan are \npresented in (section 4.4) Warnings and Precautions. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn the neoadjuvant-adjuvant EBC study (BO22227), at a median follow-up exceeding 70 months, \n10.1 % (30/296) of patients treated with Herceptin intravenous developed antibodies against \ntrastuzumab. Neutralizing anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in post-baseline samples in 2 of \n30 patients in the Herceptin intravenous arm.  \n \nThe clinical relevance of these antibodies is not known. The presence of anti-trastuzumab antibodies \nhad no impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy (determined by pathological Complete Response [pCR] \nand event free survival [EFS]) and safety determined by occurrence of administration related reactions \n(ARRs) of Herceptin intravenous. \n \nThere are no immunogenicity data available for Herceptin in gastric cancer. \n \nSwitching treatment between Herceptin intravenous and Herceptin subcutaneous formulation and vice \nversa \n \nStudy MO22982 investigated switching between the Herceptin intravenous and Herceptin \nsubcutaneous formulation with a primary objective to evaluate patient preference for either \n\n\n\n16 \n\nintravenous or the subcutaneous route of trastuzumab administration. In this trial, 2 cohorts (one using \nsubcutaneous formulation in vial and one using subcutaneous formulation in administration system) \nwere investigated using a 2-arm, cross-over design with 488 patients being randomized to one of two \ndifferent three-weekly Herceptin treatment sequences (IV [Cycles 1-4]→ SC [Cycles 5-8], or SC \n[Cycles 1-4]→ IV [Cycles 5-8]). Patients were either naïve to Herceptin IV treatment (20.3%) or pre-\nexposed to Herceptin IV (79.7%). For the sequence IV→SC (SC vial and SC formulation in \nadministration system cohorts combined), adverse event rates (all grades) were described pre-\nswitching (Cycles 1-4) and post-switching (Cycles 5-8) as 53.8% vs. 56.4%, respectively; for the \nsequence SC→IV (SC vial and SC formulation in administration system cohorts combined), adverse \nevent rates (all grades) were described pre- and post-switching as 65.4% vs. 48.7%, respectively. \nPre-switching rates (Cycles 1-4) for serious adverse events, grade 3 adverse events and treatment \ndiscontinuations due to adverse events were low (<5%) and similar to post-switching rates (Cycles 5-\n8). No grade 4 or grade 5 adverse events were reported. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose in human clinical trials. Single doses of Herceptin alone greater \nthan 10 mg/kg have not been administered in the clinical trials; a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg q3w \nfollowing a loading dose of 8 mg/kg has been studied in a clinical trial with metastatic gastric cancer \npatients. Doses up to this level were well tolerated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC03 \n \nTrastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20 %-30 % of primary \nbreast cancers. Studies of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry \n(IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) have \nshown that there is a broad variation of HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8 % to 34.0 % for IHC and \n7.1 % to 42.6 % for FISH. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours overexpress \nHER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not overexpress \nHER2. The extracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood stream and \nmeasured in serum samples. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTrastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of \nHER2’s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 \nsignalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism \nof HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit \nthe proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent \nmediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated \nADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared \nwith cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n17 \n\nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer \nHerceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene \namplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay. HER2 overexpression should be \ndetected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of fixed tumour blocks (see section \n4.4). HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) or \nchromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) of fixed tumour blocks. Patients are eligible for Herceptin \ntreatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3+ score by IHC or a positive \nFISH or CISH result.  \n \nTo ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory, \nwhich can ensure validation of the testing procedures. \n \nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 2: \n \nTable 2 Recommended Scoring System to Evaluate the IHC Staining Patterns in Breast Cancer \n \nScore  Staining pattern HER2 overexpression \n\nassessment \n0 No staining is observed or membrane staining is \n\nobserved in < 10 % of the tumour cells  \nNegative \n\n1+  A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is \ndetected in > 10 % of the tumour cells.

Official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply. \n \nFor any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression, the \nanalyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance \nof validated methods.  Such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate \noverexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate (congruent with 2+) and \nstrong (congruent with 3+) overexpression of HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 over expression or HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer \n \nOnly an accurate and validated assay should be used to detect HER2 over expression or HER2 gene \namplification. IHC is recommended as the first testing modality and in cases where HER2 gene \namplification status is also required, either a silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) or a FISH \ntechnique must be applied. SISH technology is however, recommended to allow for the parallel \nevaluation of tumor histology and morphology. To ensure validation of testing procedures and the \ngeneration of accurate and reproducible results, HER2 testing must be performed in a laboratory \nstaffed by trained personnel. Full instructions on assay performance and results interpretation should \nbe taken from the product information leaflet provided with the HER2 testing assays used. \n   \n\n\n\n18 \n\nIn the ToGA (BO18255) trial, patients whose tumours were either IHC3+ or FISH positive were \ndefined as HER2 positive and thus included in the trial. Based on the clinical trial results, the \nbeneficial effects were limited to patients with the highest level of HER2 protein overexpression, \ndefined by a 3+ score by IHC, or a 2+ score by IHC and a positive FISH result.  \n \nIn a method comparison study (study D008548) a high degree of concordance (>95 %) was observed \nfor SISH and FISH techniques for the detection of HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer patients. \n \nHER2 over expression should be detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of \nfixed tumour blocks; HER2 gene amplification should be detected using in situ hybridisation using \neither SISH or FISH on fixed tumour blocks.  \n \nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 3: \n \nTable 3 Recommended Scoring System to Evaluate the IHC Staining Patterns in Gastric Cancer \n \nScore Surgical specimen - staining \n\npattern \nBiopsy  specimen –  \nstaining pattern \n\nHER2 \noverexpression \nassessment \n\n0 \nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in < 10 % of tumour \ncells \n\nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in any tumour cell Negative \n\n1+ \n\nFaint ⁄ barely perceptible \nmembranous reactivity in  ≥ \n10 % of tumour cells; cells are \nreactive only in part of their \nmembrane \n\nTumour cell cluster with a faint ⁄ \nbarely perceptible membranous \nreactivity irrespective of \npercentage of tumour cells \nstained \n\nNegative \n\n2+ \n\nWeak to moderate complete, \nbasolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity in \n≥ 10 % of tumour cells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a weak \nto moderate complete, \nbasolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\nEquivocal \n\n3+ \n\nStrong complete, basolateral \nor lateral membranous \nreactivity in ≥ 10 % of tumour \ncells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a \nstrong complete, basolateral or \nlateral membranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\nPositive \n\n \nIn general, SISH or FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour \ncell to the chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nHerceptin has been used in clinical trials as monotherapy for patients with MBC who have tumours \nthat overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic \ndisease (Herceptin alone). \n \nHerceptin has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of patients \nwho have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Patients who had previously \nreceived anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 infused \nover 3 hours) with or without Herceptin. In the pivotal trial of docetaxel (100 mg/m2 infused over \n1 hour) with or without Herceptin, 60 % of the patients had received prior anthracycline-based \nadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were treated with Herceptin until progression of disease. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nThe efficacy of Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior adjuvant \nanthracyclines has not been studied. However, Herceptin plus docetaxel was efficacious in patients \nwhether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. \n \nThe test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal \nHerceptin monotherapy and Herceptin plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed immunohistochemical \nstaining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine monoclonal antibodies \nCB11 and 4D5. These tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin’s fixative. This investigative clinical \ntrial assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3+ scale. Patients classified as staining 2+ \nor 3+ were included, while those staining 0 or 1+ were excluded. Greater than 70 % of patients \nenrolled exhibited 3+ overexpression. The data suggest that beneficial effects were greater among \nthose patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 (3+). \n \nThe main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal trial of docetaxel, with or \nwithout Herceptin, was immunohistochemistry. A minority of patients was tested using fluorescence \nin-situ hybridisation (FISH). In this trial, 87 % of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+, and \n95 % of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+ and/or FISH-positive. \n \nWeekly dosing in metastatic breast cancer \n \nThe efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies are summarised in \nTable 4: \n \nTable 4 Efficacy Results from the Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Studies \n \nParameter Monotherapy Combination Therapy \n\n Herceptin1 \n \n \n\nN=172 \n\nHerceptin \nplus \n\npaclitaxel2 \nN=68 \n\nPaclitaxel2 \n \n \n\nN=77 \n\nHerceptin \nplus \n\ndocetaxel3 \nN=92 \n\nDocetaxel3 \n \n \n\nN=94 \nResponse rate \n(95 %CI) \n\n18 % \n(13 - 25) \n\n49 % \n(36 - 61) \n\n17 % \n(9 - 27) \n\n61 % \n(50-71) \n\n34 % \n(25-45) \n\nMedian duration of \nresponse (months) \n(95 %CI) \n\n9.1 \n(5.6-10.3) \n\n8.3 \n(7.3-8.8) \n\n4.6 \n(3.7-7.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.3 – 15.0) \n\n5.7 \n(4.6-7.6) \n\nMedian TTP \n(months) (95 %CI) \n\n3.2 \n(2.6-3.5) \n\n7.1 \n(6.2-12.0) \n\n3.0 \n(2.0-4.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.2-13.5) \n\n6.1 \n(5.4-7.2) \n\nMedian Survival \n(months) (95 %CI) \n\n16.4 \n(12.3-ne) \n\n24.8 \n(18.6-33.7) \n\n17.9 \n(11.2-23.8) \n\n31.2 \n(27.3-40.8) \n\n22.74 \n(19.1-30.8) \n\nTTP = time to progression; \"ne\" indicates that it could not be estimated or it was not yet reached. \n1.

More patients treated with Herceptin and paclitaxel progressed in the central nervous system \nthan those treated with paclitaxel alone (12.6 % versus 6.5 %; p=0.377). \n \nEarly breast cancer (adjuvant setting) \n \nEarly breast cancer is defined as non-metastatic primary invasive carcinoma of the breast. \nIn the adjuvant treatment setting, Herceptin was investigated in 4 large multicentre, randomised, trials.\n  \n- Study BO16348 was designed to compare one and two years of three-weekly Herceptin \n\ntreatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established \nchemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). In addition, comparison of two years of \nHerceptin treatment versus one year of Herceptin treatment was performed. Patients assigned to \nreceive Herceptin were given an initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg every \nthree weeks for either one or two years. \n\n- The NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies that comprise the joint analysis were designed to \ninvestigate the clinical utility of combining Herceptin treatment with paclitaxel following AC \nchemotherapy, additionally the NCCTG N9831 study also investigated adding Herceptin \nsequentially to AC→P chemotherapy in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery. \n\n- The BCIRG 006 study was designed to investigate combining Herceptin treatment with \ndocetaxel either following AC chemotherapy or in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin \nin patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nEarly breast cancer in the HERA trial was limited to operable, primary, invasive adenocarcinoma of \nthe breast, with axillary nodes positive or axillary nodes negative if tumors at least 1 cm in diameter.  \n \nIn the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies, EBC was limited to women with \noperable breast cancer at high risk, defined as HER2-positive and axillary lymph node positive or \nHER2 positive and lymph node negative with high risk features (tumor size > 1 cm and ER negative or \ntumor size > 2 cm, regardless of hormonal status). \n \nIn the BCIRG 006 study HER2 positive, EBC was defined as either lymph node positive or high risk \nnode negative patients with no (pN0) lymph node involvement, and at least 1 of the following factors: \ntumour size greater than 2 cm, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative, histological \nand/or nuclear grade 2-3, or age < 35 years). \n \nThe efficacy results from the BO16348 trial following 12 months* and 8 years** median follow-up \nare summarized in Table 6: \n \nTable 6 Efficacy Results from Study BO16348 \n \n Median follow-up \n\n12 months* \nMedian follow-up \n\n8 years** \nParameter Observation \n\nN=1693 \nHerceptin \n\n1 Year \nN = 1693 \n\nObservation \nN= 1697*** \n\nHerceptin \n1 Year \n\nN = 1702*** \nDisease-free survival     \n- No. patients with event 219 (12.9 %) 127 (7.5 %) 570 (33.6 %) 471 (27.7 %) \n- No. patients without event 1474 (87.1 %) 1566 (92.5 %) 1127 (66.4 %) 1231 (72.3 %) \nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard Ratio versus Observation 0.54 0.76 \nRecurrence-free survival     \n- No. patients with event 208 (12.3 %) 113 (6.7 %) 506 (29.8 %) 399 (23.4 %) \n- No. patients without event 1485 (87.7 %) 1580 (93.3 %) 1191 (70.2 %) 1303 (76.6 %) \nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard Ratio versus Observation 0.51 0.73 \nDistant disease-free survival     \n- No. patients with event 184 (10.9 %) 99 (5.8 %) 488 (28.8 %) 399 (23.4 %) \n- No. patients without event 1508 (89.1 %) 1594 (94.6 %) 1209 (71.2 %) 1303 (76.6 %) \nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard Ratio versus Observation 0.50 0.76 \nOverall survival (death)     \n- No. patients with event 40 (2.4 %) 31 (1.8 %) 350 (20.6 %) 278 (16.3 %) \n- No. patients without event 1653 (97.6 %) 1662 (98.2 %) 1347 (79.4 %) 1424 (83.7 %) \nP-value versus Observation 0.24 0.0005 \nHazard Ratio versus Observation 0.75 0.76 \n*Co-primary endpoint of DFS of 1 year versus observation met the pre-defined statistical boundary \n**Final analysis (including crossover of 52 % of patients from the observation arm to Herceptin) \n*** There is a discrepancy in the overall sample size due to a small number of patients who were randomized \nafter the cut-off date for the 12-month median follow-up analysis \n \nThe efficacy results from the interim efficacy analysis crossed the protocol pre-specified statistical \nboundary for the comparison of 1-year of Herceptin versus observation. After a median follow-up of \n12 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for disease free survival (DFS) was 0.54 (95 % CI 0.44, 0.67) which \ntranslates into an absolute benefit, in terms of a 2-year disease-free survival rate, of 7.6 percentage \npoints (85.8 % versus 78.2 %) in favour of the Herceptin arm. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nA final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 8 years, which showed that 1 year \nHerceptin treatment is associated with a 24 % risk reduction compared to observation only (HR=0.76, \n95 % CI 0.67, 0.86). This translates into an absolute benefit in terms of an 8 year disease free survival \nrate of 6.4 percentage points in favour of 1 year Herceptin treatment.  \n \nIn this final analysis, extending Herceptin treatment for a duration of two years did not show \nadditional benefit over treatment for 1 year [DFS HR in the intent to treat (ITT) population of 2 years \nversus 1 year=0.99 (95 % CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value=0.90 and OS HR=0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value= 0.78]. \nThe rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year treatment arm (8.1 % versus \n4.6 % in the 1-year treatment arm). More patients experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event \nin the 2-year treatment arm (20.4 %) compared with the 1-year treatment arm (16.3 %). \n \nIn the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies Herceptin was administered in combination with \npaclitaxel, following AC chemotherapy.  \n \n\nDoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were administered concurrently as follows: \n \n- intravenous push doxorubicin, at 60 mg/ m2, given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. \n \n\n - intravenous cyclophosphamide, at 600 mg/ m2 over 30 minutes, given every 3 weeks for 4 \n  cycles. \n\n \nPaclitaxel, in combination with Herceptin, was administered as follows: \n\n \n- intravenous paclitaxel - 80 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every week \n\nfor 12 weeks.  \nor  \n\n- intravenous paclitaxel - 175 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every 3 \nweeks for 4 cycles (day 1 of each cycle). \n\n \nThe efficacy results from the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG 9831 trials at the time of \nthe definitive analysis of DFS* are summarized in Table 7.

The primary endpoint was overall survival which was \ndefined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. At the time of \nthe analysis a total of 349 randomized patients had died: 182 patients (62.8 %) in the control arm and \n167 patients (56.8 %) in the treatment arm. The majority of the deaths were due to events related to the \nunderlying cancer. \n \nPost-hoc subgroup analyses indicate that positive treatment effects are limited to targeting tumours \nwith higher levels of HER2 protein (IHC 2+/FISH+ or IHC 3+). The median overall survival for the \nhigh HER2 expressing group was 11.8 months versus 16 months, HR 0.65 (95 % CI 0.51-0.83) and \nthe median progression free survival was 5.5 months versus 7.6 months, HR 0.64 (95 % CI 0.51-0.79) \nfor FP versus FP + H, respectively. For overall survival, the HR was 0.75 (95 % CI 0.51-1.11) in the \nIHC 2+/FISH+ group and the HR was 0.58 (95 % CI 0.41-0.81) in the IHC 3+/FISH+ group. \n \nIn an exploratory subgroup analysis performed in the TOGA (BO18255) trial there was no apparent \nbenefit on overall survival with the addition of Herceptin in patients with ECOG PS 2 at baseline [HR \n0.96 (95 % CI 0.51-1.79)], non measurable [HR 1.78 (95 % CI 0.87-3.66)] and locally advanced \ndisease [HR 1.20 (95 % CI 0.29-4.97)].  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nHerceptin in all subsets of the paediatric population for breast and gastric cancer (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic model analysis \nusing pooled data from 1,582 subjects, including patients with HER2 positive MBC, EBC, AGC or \nother tumor types, and healthy volunteers, in 18 Phase I, II and III trials receiving Herceptin IV. A \ntwo-compartment model with parallel linear and non-linear elimination from the central compartment \ndescribed the trastuzumab concentration-time profile. Due to non-linear elimination, total clearance \nincreased with decreasing concentration. Therefore, no constant value for half-life of trastuzumab can \nbe deduced. The t1/2 decreases with decreasing concentrations within a dosing interval (see Table 16). \nMBC and EBC patients had similar PK parameters (e.g. clearance (CL), the central compartment \nvolume (Vc)) and population-predicted steady-state exposures (Cmin, Cmax and AUC). Linear clearance \nwas 0.136 L/day for MBC, 0.112 L/day for EBC and 0.176 L/day for AGC.  The non-linear \nelimination parameter values were 8.81 mg/day for the maximum elimination rate (Vmax) and 8.92 \n\n\n\n28 \n\nµg/mL for the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the MBC, EBC, and AGC patients. The central \ncompartment volume was 2.62 L for patients with MBC and EBC and 3.63 L for patients with AGC.  \nIn the final population PK model, in addition to primary tumor type, body-weight, serum aspartate \naminotransferase and albumin were identified as a statistically significant covariates affecting the \nexposure of trastuzumab. However, the magnitude of effect of these covariates on trastuzumab \nexposure suggests that these covariates are unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on \ntrastuzumab concentrations. \n \nThe population predicted PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) and PK parameter \nvalues at clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax and Cmin) for MBC, EBC and AGC patients treated \nwith the approved q1w and q3w dosing regimens are shown in Table 14 (Cycle 1), Table 15 (steady-\nstate), and Table 16 (PK parameters). \n \nTable 14 Population Predicted Cycle 1 PK Exposure Values (median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) for \nHerceptin IV Dosing Regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC Patients \n \n\nRegimen Primary tumor type N \nCmin \n\n(µg/mL) \nCmax \n\n(µg/mL) \nAUC0-21days \n\n(µg.day/mL) \n\n8mg/kg + \n6mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 28.7  (2.9 - 46.3) \n182  \n\n(134 - 280) \n1376 \n\n(728 - 1998) \n\nEBC 390 30.9  (18.7 - 45.5) \n176  \n\n(127 - 227) \n1390 \n\n(1039 - 1895) \n\nAGC 274 23.1 (6.1 - 50.3) \n132 \n\n(84.2 – 225) \n1109 \n\n(588 – 1938) \n\n4mg/kg + \n2mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 37.4  (8.7 - 58.9) \n76.5  \n\n(49.4 - 114) \n1073  \n\n(597 – 1584) \n\nEBC 390 38.9  (25.3 - 58.8) \n76.0 \n\n(54.7 - 104) \n1074  \n\n(783 - 1502) \n \nTable 15 Population Predicted Steady State PK Exposure Values (median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) \nfor Herceptin IV Dosing Regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC Patients \n \n\nRegimen Primary tumor type N \nCmin,ss* \n\n(µg/mL) \nCmax,ss** \n(µg/mL) \n\nAUCss, 0-21days \n(µg.day/mL) \n\nTime to \nsteady-\nstate*** \n(week) \n\n8mg/kg + \n6mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 44.2  (1.8 - 85.4) \n179  \n\n(123 - 266) \n1736  \n\n(618 - 2756) 12 \n\nEBC 390 53.8  (28.7 - 85.8) \n184  \n\n(134 - 247) \n1927  \n\n(1332 -2771) 15 \n\nAGC 274 32.9  (6.1 – 88.9) \n131  \n\n(72.5 -251) \n1338  \n\n(557 - 2875) 9 \n\n4mg/kg + \n2mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 63.1  (11.7 - 107) \n107  \n\n(54.2 - 164) \n1710  \n\n(581 - 2715) 12 \n\nEBC 390 72.6  (46 - 109) \n115  \n\n(82.6 - 160) \n1893  \n\n(1309 -2734) 14 \n\n*Cmin,ss – Cmin at steady state  \n**Cmax,ss = Cmax at steady state \n*** time to 90% of steady-state \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTable 16 Population Predicted PK Parameter Values at Steady State for Herceptin IV Dosing \nRegimens in MBC, EBC and AGC Patients \n \n\nRegimen Primary tumor type N \n\nTotal CL range \nfrom Cmax,ss to \n\nCmin,ss \n(L/day) \n\nt1/2 range from Cmax,ss to \nCmin,ss \n(day)  \n\n8mg/kg + \n6mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 0.183 - 0.302  15.1 - 23.3 \n\nEBC 390 0.158 - 0.253 17.5 – 26.6 \n\nAGC 274 0.189 - 0.337 12.6 - 20.6 \n\n4mg/kg + \n2mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 0.213 - 0.259 17.2 - 20.4 \n\nEBC 390 0.184 - 0.221 19.7 - 23.2 \n \nTrastuzumab washout \n \nTrastuzumab washout period was assessed following q1w or q3w intravenous administration using the \npopulation PK model.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use \nare the responsibility of the user, and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, \nunless reconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2∞C – 8∞C). \n \nDo not freeze the reconstituted solution. \n \nFor storage conditions of the opened medicinal product, see section 6.3 and 6.6. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nHerceptin vial: \n \nOne 15 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film \ncontaining 150 mg of trastuzumab. \n \nEach carton contains one vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nHerceptin IV is provided in sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, single use vials.  \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution and dilution procedures. Care must be \ntaken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. Since the medicinal product does not contain any \nanti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, aseptic technique must be observed.  \n \nAseptic preparation, handling and storage:  \n \nAseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be:  \n∑ performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice rules \n\nespecially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products.  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n∑ prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \nsafe handling of intravenous agents. \n\n∑ followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure \nmaintenance of the aseptic conditions \n\n \nEach vial of Herceptin is reconstituted with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection (not supplied). Use of \nother reconstitution solvents should be avoided.  \n \nThis yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at \na pH of approximately 6.0. A volume overage of 4 % ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be \nwithdrawn from each vial. \n \nHerceptin should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted solution may result in problems with the amount of \nHerceptin that can be withdrawn from the vial. \n \nThe reconstituted solution should not be frozen. \n \nInstructions for aseptic reconstitution: \n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection in the vial containing the \nlyophilised Herceptin, directing the stream into the lyophilised cake. \n2) Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Herceptin results in a colourless to pale yellow \ntransparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \nInstructions for aseptic dilution of the reconstituted solution \n \nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n\n∑ based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose \nof 2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n\n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n   21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution)  \n \n\n∑ based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose \nof 6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n\n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n   21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution)  \n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to an infusion bag \ncontaining 250 mL of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution. Do not use with glucose-containing solutions \n(see section 6.2). The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming.  \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.  \n \nNo incompatibilities between Herceptin and polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene bags \nhave been observed. \n \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nHerceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \n(MBC): \n \n- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy \n\nregimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an \nanthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor \npositive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these \ntreatments. \n\n \n- in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. \n \n- in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease. \n \n- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with \n hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nHerceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer \n(EBC). \n \n- following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n \n- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with \n\npaclitaxel or docetaxel. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. \n- in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Herceptin therapy, for \n\nlocally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \nHerceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have \neither HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated \nassay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Herceptin treatment \nshould only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(see section 4.4), and should be administered by a healthcare professional only. \n \nIt is important to check the product labels to ensure that the correct formulation (intravenous or \nsubcutaneous fixed dose) is being administered to the patient, as prescribed. Herceptin subcutaneous \nformulation is not intended for intravenous administration and should be administered via a \nsubcutaneous injection only.  \n \nSwitching treatment between Herceptin intravenous and Herceptin subcutaneous formulations and \nvice versa, using the three-weekly (q3w) dosing regimen, was investigated in study MO22982 (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug \nbeing prepared and administered is Herceptin (trastuzumab) and not Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose for Herceptin subcutaneous formulation is 600 mg irrespective of the patient’s \nbody weight. No loading dose is required. This dose should be administered subcutaneously over 2-5 \nminutes every three weeks. \n \nIn the pivotal trial (BO22227) Herceptin subcutaneous formulation was administered in the \nneoadjuvant/adjuvant setting in patients with early breast cancer. The preoperative chemotherapy \nregimen consisted of docetaxel (75 mg/m²) followed by FEC (5FU, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) \nat a standard dose. \n \nSee section 5.1 for chemotherapy combination dosing. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nPatients with MBC should be treated with Herceptin until progression of disease. Patients with EBC \nshould be treated with Herceptin for 1 year or until disease recurrence, whichever occurs first; \nextending treatment in EBC beyond one year is not recommended (see section 5.1). \n \nDose reduction \n \nNo reductions in the dose of Herceptin were made during clinical trials. Patients may continue therapy \nduring periods of reversible, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression butthey should be monitored \ncarefully for complications of neutropenia during this time. Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics (SmPC) for paclitaxel, docetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose \nreduction or delays. \n \nIf left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) percentage drops ≥ 10 points from baseline AND to below \n50 %, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately \n\n\n\n35 \n\n3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or has declined further, or if symptomatic congestive heart failure \n(CHF) has developed, discontinuation of Herceptin should be strongly considered, unless the benefits \nfor the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \nMissed doses \n \nIf the patient misses a dose of Herceptin subcutaneous formulation, it is recommended to administer \nthe next 600 mg dose (i.e. the missed dose) as soon as possible. The interval between consecutive \nHerceptin subcutaneous formulation administrations should not be less than three weeks. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nDedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have not \nbeen carried out. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age and renal impairment were not shown \nto affect trastuzumab disposition. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Herceptin in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe 600 mg dose should be administered as a subcutaneous injection only over 2-5 minutes every \nthree weeks. The injection site should be alternated between the left and right thigh. New injections \nshould be given at least 2.5 cm from the old site and never into areas where the skin is red, bruised, \ntender, or hard. During the treatment course with Herceptin subcutaneous formulation other medicinal \nproducts for subcutaneous administration should preferably be injected at different sites. Patients \nshould be observed for six hours after the first injection and for two hours after subsequent injections \nfor signs or symptoms of administration-related reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nFor instructions on use and handling of Herceptin subcutaneous formulation refer to section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n∑ Hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, hyaluronidase or to any of the other \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n∑ Severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring \n\nsupplementary oxygen therapy. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of \nthe testing procedures (see section 5.1). \n \nCurrently no data from clinical trials are available on re-treatment of patients with previous exposure \nto Herceptin in the adjuvant setting. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nCardiac dysfunction \n \nGeneral considerations \n \nPatients treated with Herceptin are at increased risk for developing CHF (New York Heart Association \n[NYHA] Class II-IV) or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. These events have been observed in \npatients receiving Herceptin therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, particularly \nfollowing anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)–containing chemotherapy. These may be \nmoderate to severe and have been associated with death (see section 4.8). In addition, caution should \nbe exercised in treating patients with increased cardiac risk, e.g. hypertension, documented coronary \nartery disease, CHF, LVEF of <55%, older age. \n \nAll candidates for treatment with Herceptin, but especially those with prior anthracycline and \ncyclophosphamide exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and \nphysical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or multigated acquisition \n(MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop \ncardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 months \nduring treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months from the \nlast administration of Herceptin. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be made before deciding to \ntreat with Herceptin. \n \nTrastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months after stopping Herceptin treatment \nbased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of all available data (see section 5.2). Patients who \nreceive anthracyclines after stopping Herceptin may possibly be at increased risk of cardiac \ndysfunction. If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after \nstopping Herceptin. If anthracyclines are used, the patient’s cardiac function should be monitored \ncarefully. \n \nFormal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular \nconcerns following baseline screening. In all patients cardiac function should be monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every 12 weeks). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac \ndysfunction. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more frequent \nmonitoring (e.g. every 6-8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular function, \nbut remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of \nHerceptin therapy has been seen. \n \nThe safety of continuation or resumption of Herceptin in patients who experience cardiac dysfunction \nhas not been prospectively studied. If LVEF percentage drops ≥ 10 points from baseline AND to \nbelow 50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within \napproximately 3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, or symptomatic CHF has \ndeveloped, discontinuation of Herceptin should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the \nindividual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \nIf symptomatic cardiac failure develops during Herceptin therapy, it should be treated with standard \nmedicinal products for CHF. Most patients who developed CHF or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction \nin pivotal trials improved with standard CHF treatment consisting of an angiotensin-converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a beta-blocker. The majority of \npatients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of Herceptin treatment continued on \ntherapy without additional clinical cardiac events. \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nHerceptin and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the MBC setting. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPatients with MBC who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiac dysfunction \nwith Herceptin treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of Herceptin and \nanthracyclines. \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nFor patients with EBC, cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 \nmonths during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months \nfrom the last administration of Herceptin. In patients who receive anthracycline-containing \nchemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the last \nadministration of Herceptin, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. \n \nPatients with history of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, \nhistory of or existing CHF (NYHA Class II –IV), LVEF of < 55%, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac \narrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, poorly \ncontrolled hypertension (hypertension controlled by standard medical treatment eligible), and \nhemodynamic effective pericardial effusion were excluded from adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC \npivotal trials with Herceptin and therefore treatment cannot be recommended in such patients. \n \nAdjuvant treatment \n \nHerceptin and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in the adjuvant treatment setting. \n \nIn patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events \nwas observed when Herceptin (intravenous formulation) was administered after anthracycline-\ncontaining chemotherapy compared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel \nand carboplatin and was more marked when Herceptin (intravenous formulation) was administered \nconcurrently with taxanes than when administered sequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen \nused, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred within the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal \nstudies conducted in which a median follow-up of 5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous \nincrease in the cumulative rate of symptomatic cardiac or LVEF events was observed (up to 2.37 %) in \npatients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane following anthracycline therapy, \ncompared to approximately 1 % in the two comparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide \nfollowed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin and Herceptin). \n \nRisk factors for a cardiac event identified in four large adjuvant studies included advanced age \n(> 50 years), low LVEF (<55%) at baseline, prior to or following the initiation of paclitaxel treatment, \ndecline in LVEF by 10-15 points, and prior or concurrent use of anti-hypertensive medicinal products. \nIn patients receiving Herceptin after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the risk of cardiac \ndysfunction was associated with a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline given prior to initiation of \nHerceptin and a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2. \n \nNeoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment \n \nIn patients with EBC eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, Herceptin should be used \nconcurrently with anthracyclines only in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose \nanthracycline regimens, i.e., with maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or epirubicin \n360 mg/m2. \n \nIf patients have been treated concurrently with a full course of low-dose anthracyclines and Herceptin \nin the neoadjuvant setting, no additional cytotoxic chemotherapy should be given after surgery. In \nother situations, the decision on the need for additional cytotoxic chemotherapy is determined based \non individual factors. \n \nExperience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with low dose anthracycline regimens is \ncurrently limited to two trials (MO16432 and BO22227).  \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nIn the pivotal trial MO16432, Herceptin was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy containing three cycles of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 180 mg/m2) . The incidence of \nsymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 1.7% in the Herceptin arm . \n \nIn the pivotal trial BO22227, Herceptin was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy that contained four cycles of epirubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m2); at a median \nfollow-up exceeding 70 months, the incidence of cardiac failure/congestive cardiac failure was 0.3% \nin the Herceptin intravenous arm and 0.7% in the Herceptin subcutaneous arm.  In patients with lower \nbody weights (<59 kg, the lowest body weight quartile) the fixed dose used in the Herceptin \nsubcutaneous arm was not associated with an increased risk of cardiac events or significant drop in \nLVEF. \n \nClinical experience is limited in patients above 65 years of age. \n \nAdministration-related reactions \n \nAdministration-related reactions (ARRs) are known to occur with Herceptin subcutaneous \nformulation. Pre-medication may be used to reduce risk of occurrence of ARRs. \n \nAlthough serious ARRs, including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, \nreduced oxygen saturation and respiratory distress, were not reported in the clinical trial with the \nHerceptin subcutaneous formulation, caution should be exercised as these have been associated with \nthe intravenous formulation. Patients should be observed for ARRs for six hours after the first \ninjection and for two hours after subsequent injections. They can be treated with an \nanalgesic/antipyretic such as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as \ndiphenhydramine. Serious reactions to intravenous Herceptin have been treated successfully with \nsupportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions \nwere associated with a clinical course culminating in a fatal outcome. Patients experiencing dyspnoea \nat rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a \nfatal ARR. Therefore, these patients should not be treated with Herceptin (see section 4.3). \n \nPulmonary events \n \nCaution is recommended with Herceptin subcutaneous formulation as severe pulmonary events have \nbeen reported with the use of the intravenous formulation in the post-marketing setting (see section \n4.8). These events have occasionally been fatal and may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction \nor with delayed onset. In addition, cases of interstitial lung disease including lung infiltrates, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute \npulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been reported. Risk factors associated with \ninterstitial lung disease include prior or concomitant therapy with other anti-neoplastic therapies \nknown to be associated with it such as taxanes, gemcitabine, vinorelbine and radiation therapy. \nPatients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and \ncomorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, these patients should not be \ntreated with Herceptin (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised for pneumonitis, especially in \npatients being treated concomitantly with taxanes. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between \nHerceptin and the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed.  \n \nEffect of trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \n \nPharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC \nsuggested that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites 6-α hydroxyl-\npaclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) was not altered in the presence of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg or \n4 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w or 2 mg/kg q1w IV, respectively). \n\n\n\n39 \n\nHowever, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one doxorubicin metabolite, (7-deoxy-13 \ndihydro-doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the clinical impact of the elevation of this \nmetabolite was unclear.   \n \nData from study JP16003, a single-arm study of Herceptin (4 mg/kg IV loading dose and 2 mg/kg IV \nweekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 IV) in Japanese women with HER2- positive MBC, suggested that \nconcomitant administration of Herceptin had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of \ndocetaxel. Study JP19959 was a substudy of BO18255 (ToGA) performed in male and female \nJapanese patients with advanced gastric cancer to study the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and \ncisplatin when used with or without Herceptin. The results of this substudy suggested that the \nexposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine was not affected by concurrent use of \ncisplatin or by concurrent use of cisplatin plus Herceptin. However, capecitabine itself showed higher \nconcentrations and a longer half-life when combined with Herceptin. The data also suggested that the \npharmacokinetics of cisplatin were not affected by concurrent use of capecitabine or by concurrent use \nof capecitabine plus Herceptin. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced \ninoperable HER2-positive cancer suggested that trastuzumab had no impact on the PK of carboplatin.  \n \nEffect of antineoplastic agents on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics \n \nBy comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after Herceptin monotherapy (4 mg/kg \nloading/2 mg/kg q1w IV) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women with HER2- positive \nMBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration of docetaxel on the \npharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. \n \nComparison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase III study \n(H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with Herceptin and paclitaxel and two Phase II \nstudies in which Herceptin was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and MO16982), in women \nwith HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab trough serum \nconcentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant \nadministration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of trastuzumab PK \ndata from Study M77004 in which women with HER2-positive MBC were treated concomitantly with \nHerceptin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin to trastuzumab PK data in studies where Herceptin was \nadministered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide \nor paclitaxel (Study H0648g), suggested no effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel on the \npharmacokinetics of trastuzumab.  \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 suggested that carboplatin had no impact on the \nPK of trastuzumab. \n \nThe administration of concomitant anastrozole did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith Herceptin and for 7 months after treatment has concluded (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nReproduction studies have been conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of the \nweekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg Herceptin intravenous formulation and have revealed no \nevidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. Placental transfer of trastuzumab during the early \n(days 20-50 of gestation) and late (days 120-150 of gestation) fetal development period was observed. \n\n\n\n40 \n\nIt is not known whether Herceptin can affect reproductive capacity. As animal reproduction studies are \nnot always predictive of human response, Herceptin should be avoided during pregnancy unless the \npotential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, cases of fetal renal growth and/or function impairment in association \nwith oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the fetus, have been \nreported in pregnant women receiving Herceptin. Women who become pregnant should be advised of \nthe possibility of harm to the fetus. If a pregnant woman is treated with Herceptin, or if a patient \nbecomes pregnant while receiving Herceptin or within 7 months following last dose of Herceptin, \nclose monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is desirable. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nA study conducted in lactating Cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human \nmaintenance dose of 2 mg/kg Herceptin intravenous formulation demonstrated that trastuzumab is \nsecreted in the milk. The presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not associated \nwith any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. It is not known \nwhether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk. As human IgG1 is secreted into human milk, and the \npotential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed during Herceptin therapy \nand for 7 months after the last dose. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no fertility data available.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHerceptin has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Dizziness \nand somnolence may occur during treatment with Herceptin (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing \nadministration-related symptoms (see section 4.4) should be advised not to drive and use machines \nuntil symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAmongst the most serious and/or common adverse reactions reported in Herceptin usage (intravenous \nand subcutaneous formulations) to date are cardiac dysfunction, administration-related reactions, \nhaematotoxicity (in particular neutropenia), infections and pulmonary adverse reactions. \n \nThe safety profile of Herceptin subcutaneous formulation (evaluated in 298 and 297 patients treated \nwith the intravenous and subcutaneous formulations respectively) from the pivotal trial in EBC was \noverall similar to the known safety profile of the intravenous formulation.  \n \nSevere adverse events (defined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria \nfor Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE grade ≥3) version 3.0) were equally distributed between both \nHerceptin formulations (52.3 % versus 53.5 % in the intravenous formulation versus subcutaneous \nformulation respectively).  \n \nSome adverse events / reactions were reported with a higher frequency for the subcutaneous \nformulation: \n\n∑ Serious adverse events (most of which were identified because of in-patient hospitalisation or \nprolongation of existing hospitalisation): 14.1 % for the intravenous formulation versus \n21.5 % for the subcutaneous formulation. The difference in serious adverse event rates \nbetween formulations was mainly due to infections with or without neutropenia (4.4 % versus \n8.1 %) and cardiac disorders (0.7 % versus 1.7 %); \n\n\n\n41 \n\n∑ Post-operative wound infections (severe and/or serious): 1.7  % versus 3.0  % for the \nintravenous formulation versus subcutaneous formulation, respectively; \n\n∑ Administration-related reactions: 37.2 % versus 47.8 % for the intravenous formulation versus \nsubcutaneous formulation, respectively during the treatment phase; \n\n∑ Hypertension: 4.7 % versus 9.8 % for the intravenous formulation versus subcutaneous \nformulation respectively.   \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions with the intravenous formulation \n \nIn this section, the following categories of frequency have been used: very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nPresented in Table 1 are adverse reactions that have been reported in association with the use of \nintravenous Herceptin alone or in combination with chemotherapy in pivotal clinical trials and in the \npost-marketing setting. \n \nAll the terms included are based on the highest percentage seen in pivotal clinical trials. In addition, \nterms reported in the post marketing setting are included in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Undesirable effects reported with intravenous Herceptin monotherapy or in combination with \nchemotherapy in pivotal clinical trials (N = 8386) and in post-marketing \n \nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency  \nInfections and infestations Infection Very common \n\nNasopharyngitis Very common \nNeutropenic sepsis Common \nCystitis Common \n  \nInfluenza Common \nSinusitis Common \nSkin infection Common \nRhinitis Common \nUpper respiratory tract infection Common \nUrinary tract infection Common \n  \n  \nPharyngitis Common \n  \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and unspecified \n(incl.

with taxanes \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac dysfunction \n \nCongestive heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) is a common adverse reaction to Herceptin. It has been \nassociated with a fatal outcome. Signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunction such as dyspnoea, \northopnoea, increased cough, pulmonary oedema, S3 gallop, or reduced ventricular ejection fraction, \nhave been observed in patients treated with Herceptin (see section 4.4). \n \nIn 3 pivotal EBC clinical trials of adjuvant intravenous Herceptin given in combination with \nchemotherapy, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac dysfunction (specifically symptomatic congestive \nheart failure) was similar in patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (ie did not receive \nHerceptin) and in patients who were administered Herceptin sequentially after a taxane (0.3-0.4 %). \nThe rate was highest in patients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane (2.0 %). \nIn the neoadjuvant setting, the experience of concurrent administration of Herceptin and low dose \nanthracycline regimen is limited (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen Herceptin was administered after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy NYHA Class III-IV \nheart failure was observed in 0.6 % of patients in the one-year arm after a median follow-up of 12 \nmonths. In study BO16348, after a median follow-up of 8 years the incidence of severe CHF (NYHA \nClass III & IV) in the Herceptin 1 year treatment arm was 0.8 %, and the rate of mild symptomatic and \nasymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was 4.6 %. \nReversibility of severe CHF (defined as a sequence of at least two consecutive LVEF values ≥50 % \nafter the event) was evident for 71.4 % of Herceptin-treated patients. Reversibility of mild \n\n\n\n45 \n\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated for 79.5 % of patients. \nApproximately 17 % of cardiac dysfunction related events occurred after completion of Herceptin. \n \nIn the pivotal metastatic trials of intravenous Herceptin, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction varied \nbetween 9 % and 12 % when it was combined with paclitaxel compared with 1 % – 4 % for paclitaxel \nalone. For monotherapy, the rate was 6 % – 9 %. The highest rate of cardiac dysfunction was seen in \npatients receiving Herceptin concurrently with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (27 %), and was \nsignificantly higher than for anthracycline/cyclophosphamide alone (7 % – 10 %). In a subsequent trial \nwith prospective monitoring of cardiac function, the incidence of symptomatic CHF was 2.2 % in \npatients receiving Herceptin and docetaxel, compared with 0 % in patients receiving docetaxel alone. \nMost of the patients (79 %) who developed cardiac dysfunction in these trials experienced an \nimprovement after receiving standard treatment for CHF. \n \nAdministration-related reactions/hypersensitivity \n \nAdministration-related reactions (ARRs)/hypersensitivity reactions such as chills and/or fever, \ndyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, respiratory \ndistress, rash, nausea, vomiting and headache were seen in Herceptin clinical trials (see section 4.4). \nThe rate of ARRs of all grades varied between studies depending on the indication, the data collection \nmethodology, and whether trastuzumab was given concurrently with chemotherapy or as \nmonotherapy. \n \nAnaphylactoid reactions have been observed in isolated cases. \n \nHaematotoxicity \n \nFebrile neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred very \ncommonly. The frequency of occurrence of hypoprothrombinemia is not known. The risk of \nneutropenia may be slightly increased when trastuzumab is administered with docetaxel following \nanthracycline therapy. \n \nPulmonary events \n \nSevere pulmonary adverse reactions occur in association with the use of Herceptin and have been \nassociated with a fatal outcome. These include, but are not limited to, pulmonary infiltrates, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute \npulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions with the subcutaneous formulation \n \nAdministration-related reactions \n \nIn the pivotal trial, the rate of all grade ARRs was 37.2 % with the Herceptin intravenous formulation \nand 47.8 % with the Herceptin subcutaneous formulation; severe grade 3 reactions were reported in \n2.0 % and 1.7 % of the patients, respectively during the treatment phase; no severe grade 4 or 5 \nreactions were observed. All of the severe ARRs with the Herceptin subcutaneous formulation \noccurred during concurrent administration with chemotherapy. The most frequent severe reaction was \ndrug hypersensitivity. \n \nThe systemic reactions included hypersensitivity, hypotension, tachycardia, cough, and dyspnoea. The \nlocal reactions included erythema, pruritus, oedema, rash and pain at the site of the injection. \n \nInfections \n \nThe rate of severe infections (NCI CTCAE grade ≥3) was 5.0 % versus 7.1 %, in the Herceptin \nintravenous formulation arm and the Herceptin subcutaneous formulation arm respectively. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nThe rate of serious infections (most of which were identified because of in-patient hospitalisation or \nprolongation of existing hospitalisation) was 4.4 % in the Herceptin intravenous formulation arm and \n8.1 % in the Herceptin subcutaneous formulation arm. The difference between formulations was \nmainly observed during the adjuvant treatment phase (monotherapy) and was mainly due to \npostoperative wound infections, but also to various other infections such as respiratory tract infections, \nacute pyelonephritis and sepsis. They resolved within a mean of 13 days in the Herceptin intravenous \ntreatment arm and a mean of 17 days in the Herceptin subcutaneous treatment arm. \n \nHypertensive events \n \nIn the pivotal trial BO22227, there were more than twice as many patients reporting all grade \nhypertension with the Herceptin subcutaneous  formulation (4.7 % versus 9.8 % in the intravenous and \nsubcutaneous formulations respectively), with a greater proportion of patients with severe events (NCI \nCTCAE grade ≥3) <1 % versus 2.0 % the intravenous and subcutaneous formulations respectively. All \nbut one patient who reported severe hypertension had a history of hypertension before they entered the \nstudy. Some of the severe events occurred on the day of the injection. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn the neoadjuvant-adjuvant EBC study  (BO22227), at a median follow-up exceeding 70 months, \n10.1% (30/296) of patients treated with Herceptin intravenous and 15.9 % (47/295) of patients \nreceiving Herceptin subcutaneous vial developed antibodies against trastuzumab. Neutralizing anti-\ntrastuzumab antibodies were detected in post-baseline samples in 2 of 30 patients in the Herceptin \nintravenous arm and 3 of 47 in the Herceptin subcutaneous arm. 21.0 % of patients treated with \nHerceptin subcutaneous formulation developed antibodies against the excipient hyaluronidase \n(rHuPH20).  \n \nThe clinical relevance of these antibodies is not known.The presence of anti-trastuzumab antibodies \nhad no impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy (determined by pathological Complete Response [pCR] \nand event free survival [EFS]) and safety determined by occurrence of administration related reactions \n(ARRs) of Herceptin intravenous and Herceptin subcutaneous. \n \nDetails of risk minimisation measures that are consistent with the EU Risk Management Plan are \npresented in Section 4.4. \n \nSwitching treatment between Herceptin intravenous and Herceptin subcutaneous formulation and vice \nversa \n \nStudy MO22982 investigated switching between the Herceptin intravenous and Herceptin \nsubcutaneous formulation with a primary objective to evaluate patient preference for either the \nintravenous or the subcutaneous route of trastuzumab administration. In this trial, 2 cohorts (one using \nsubcutaneous formulation in vial and one using subcutaneous formulation in administration system) \nwere investigated using a 2-arm, cross-over design with 488 patients being randomized to one of two \ndifferent three-weekly Herceptin treatment sequences (IV [Cycles 1-4]→ SC [Cycles 5-8], or SC \n[Cycles 1-4]→ IV [Cycles 5-8]). Patients were either naïve to Herceptin IV treatment (20.3%) or pre-\nexposed to Herceptin IV (79.7%). For the sequence IV→SC (SC vial and SC formulation in \nadministration system cohorts combined), adverse event rates (all grades) were described pre-\nswitching (Cycles 1-4) and post-switching (Cycles 5-8) as 53.8% vs. 56.4%, respectively; for the \nsequence SC→IV (SC vial and SC formulation in administration system cohorts combined), adverse \nevent rates (all grades) were described pre- and post-switching as 65.4% vs. 48.7%, respectively. \nPre-switching rates (Cycles 1-4) for serious adverse events, grade 3 adverse events and treatment \ndiscontinuations due to adverse events were low (<5%) and similar to post-switching rates (Cycles 5-\n8). No grade 4 or grade 5 adverse events were reported. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of up to 960 mg of Herceptin subcutaneous formulation have been administered with no \nreported untoward effects. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC03 \n \nHerceptin subcutaneous formulation contains recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), an \nenzyme used to increase the dispersion and absorption of co-administered drugs when administered \nsubcutaneously. \n \nTrastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20% - 30% of primary \nbreast cancers. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours overexpress HER2 have a \nshortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not overexpress HER2. The \nextracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood stream and measured in \nserum samples. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTrastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of \nHER2’s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 \nsignalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism \nof HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit \nthe proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent \nmediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated \nADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared \nwith cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer \n \nHerceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene \namplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay. HER2 overexpression should be \ndetected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of fixed tumour blocks (see section \n4.4). HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) or \nchromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) of fixed tumour blocks. Patients are eligible for Herceptin \ntreatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3+ score by IHC or a positive \nFISH or CISH result. \n \nTo ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory, \nwhich can ensure validation of the testing procedures. \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n48 \n\nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 2: \n \nTable 2: Recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns \n \nScore  Staining pattern HER2 overexpression \n\nassessment \n0 No staining is observed or membrane staining is \n\nobserved in < 10 % of the tumour cells  \nNegative \n\n1+  A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is \ndetected in > 10 % of the tumour cells. The cells are \nonly stained in part of their membrane. \n\nNegative \n\n2+ A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is \ndetected in > 10 % of the tumour cells. \n\nEquivocal \n\n3+  Strong complete membrane staining is detected in \n> 10 % of the tumour cells. \n\nPositive \n\n \nIn general, FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour cell to \nthe chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2, or if there are more than 4 copies of the \nHER2 gene per tumour cell if no chromosome 17 control is used. \n \nIn general, CISH is considered positive if there are more than 5 copies of the HER2 gene per nucleus \nin greater than 50 % of tumour cells. \n \nFor full instructions on assay performance and interpretation please refer to the package inserts of \nvalidated FISH and CISH assays. Official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply. \n \nFor any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression, the \nanalyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance \nof validated methods. Such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate \noverexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate (congruent with 2+) and \nstrong (congruent with 3+) overexpression of HER2. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nIntravenous formulation \n \nHerceptin has been used in clinical trials as monotherapy for patients with MBC who have tumours \nthat overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic \ndisease (Herceptin alone). \n \nHerceptin has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of patients \nwho have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Patients who had previously \nreceived anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 infused \nover 3 hours) with or without Herceptin. In the pivotal trial of docetaxel (100 mg/m2 infused over \n1 hour) with or without Herceptin, 60 % of the patients had received prior anthracycline-based \nadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were treated with Herceptin until progression of disease. \n \nThe efficacy of Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior adjuvant \nanthracyclines has not been studied. However, Herceptin plus docetaxel was efficacious in patients \nwhether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. \n \nThe test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal \nHerceptin monotherapy and Herceptin plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed immunohistochemical \nstaining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine monoclonal antibodies \nCB11 and 4D5. These tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin’s fixative. This investigative clinical \n\n\n\n49 \n\ntrial assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3+ scale. Patients classified as staining 2+ \nor 3+ were included, while those staining 0 or 1+ were excluded. Greater than 70 % of patients \nenrolled exhibited 3+ overexpression. The data suggest that beneficial effects were greater among \nthose patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 (3+). \n \nThe main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal trial of docetaxel, with or \nwithout Herceptin, was immunohistochemistry. A minority of patients was tested using fluorescence \nin-situ hybridisation (FISH). In this trial, 87 % of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+, and \n95 % of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+ and/or FISH-positive. \n \nWeekly dosing in metatstatic breast cancer \n \nThe efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies are summarised in Table \n3: \n \nTable 3: Efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies \n \nParameter Monotherapy Combination Therapy \n\n Herceptin1 \n \n \n\nN=172 \n\nHerceptin \nplus \n\npaclitaxel2 \nN=68 \n\nPaclitaxel2 \n \n \n\nN=77 \n\nHerceptin \nplus \n\ndocetaxel3 \nN=92 \n\nDocetaxel3 \n \n \n\nN=94 \nResponse rate \n(95 %CI) \n\n18 % \n(13-25) \n\n49 % \n(36- 61) \n\n17 % \n(9-27) \n\n61 % \n(50-71) \n\n34 % \n(25-45) \n\nMedian duration of \nresponse (months) \n(95 %CI) \n\n9.1 \n(5.6-10.3) \n\n8.3 \n(7.3-8.8) \n\n4.6 \n(3.7-7.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.3–15.0) \n\n5.7 \n(4.6-7.6) \n\nMedian TTP \n(months) (95 %CI) \n\n3.2 \n(2.6-3.5) \n\n7.1 \n(6.2-12.0) \n\n3.0 \n(2.0-4.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.2-13.5) \n\n6.1 \n(5.4-7.2) \n\nMedian Survival \n(months) (95 %CI) \n\n16.4 \n(12.3-ne) \n\n24.8 \n(18.6-33.7) \n\n17.9 \n(11.2-23.8) \n\n31.2 \n(27.3-40.8) \n\n22.74 \n(19.1-30.8) \n\nTTP = time to progression; \"ne\" indicates that it could not be estimated or it was not yet reached. \n1.

Progression free survival was doubled in the Herceptin plus \nanastrozole arm compared to anastrozole (4.8 months versus 2.4 months).

More patients treated with Herceptin and paclitaxel progressed in the central nervous system \nthan those treated with paclitaxel alone (12.6 % versus 6.5 %; p=0.377). \n \nEarly breast cancer (adjuvant setting) \n \nIntravenous formulation \n \nEarly breast cancer is defined as non-metastatic primary invasive carcinoma of the breast. \nIn the adjuvant treatment setting, Herceptin was investigated in 4 large multicentre, randomised, trials. \n- Study BO16348 was designed to compare one and two years of three-weekly Herceptin \n\ntreatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established \nchemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). In addition, comparison of two years of \nHerceptin treatment versus one year of Herceptin treatment was performed.

The final results of study BO22227 at a median follow-up exceeding 70 \nmonths were also consistent with the known safety profile for Herceptin IV and Herceptin SC, and no \nnew safety signals were observed. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nHerceptin in all subsets of the paediatric population for breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab at a dose of 600 mg administered three-weekly by the \nsubcutaneous route was compared to the intravenous route (8 mg/kg loading dose, 6 mg/kg \nmaintenance every three weeks) in the phase III study BO22227. The pharmacokinetic results for the \nco primary endpoint, Ctrough pre dose Cycle 8, showed non-inferiority of the Herceptin subcutaneous \ncompared to the Herceptin intravenous dose adjusted by body weight.  \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \nThe mean Ctrough during the neoadjuvant treatment phase, at the pre dose Cycle 8 time point, was \nhigher in the Herceptin subcutaneous arm (78.7 µg/mL) than the Herceptin intravenous arm \n(57.8 µg/mL) of the study. During the adjuvant phase of treatment, at the pre-dose Cycle 13 time \npoint, the mean Ctrough values were 90.4 µg/mL and 62.1 µg/mL, respectively. Based on the observed \ndata in study BO22227, steady state with the intravenous formulation was reached at cycle 8. With \nHerceptin subcutaneous formulation, concentrations were approximately at steady-state following \nCycle 7 dose (pre-dose Cycle 8) with small increase in concentration (<15%) up to cycle 13. The mean \nCtrough at the subcutaneous pre- dose cycle 18 was 90.7 µg/mL and is similar to that of cycle 13, \nsuggesting no further increase after cycle 13. \n \nThe median Tmax following subcutaneous administration was approximately 3 days, with high \ninterindividual variability (range 1-14 days). The mean Cmax was expectedly lower in the Herceptin \nsubcutaneous formulation (149 μg/mL) than in the intravenous arm (end of infusion value: 221 \nμg/mL). \n \nThe mean AUC0-21 days following the Cycle 7 dose was approximately 10 % higher with the Herceptin \nsubcutaneous formulation as compared to the Herceptin intravenous formulation, with mean AUC \nvalues of 2268 µg/mL•day and 2056 µg/mL•day, respectively. The AUC0-21 days following Cycle 12 \ndose was approximately 20 % higher with the Herceptin subcutaneous formulation than the Herceptin \nintravenous dose, with mean AUC values of 2610 µg/mL•day and 2179 µg/mL•day, respectively. Due \nto the significant impact of body weight on trastuzumab clearance and the use of a fixed dose for the \nsubcutaneous administration the difference in exposure between subcutaneous and intravenous \nadministration was dependent on body weight: in patients with a body weight < 51 kg, mean steady \nstate AUC of trastuzumab was about 80% higher after subcutaneous than after intravenous treatment \nwhereas in the highest BW group (> 90 kg) AUC was 20% lower after subcutaneous than after \nintravenous treatment. \n \nA population PK model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination from the central compartment \nwas constructed using pooled Herceptin SC and Herceptin IV PK data from the phase III study \nBO22227 to describe the observed PK concentrations following Herceptin IV and Herceptin SC \nadministration in EBC patients. Bioavailability of trastuzumab given as the subcutaneous formulation \nwas estimated to be 77.1%, and the first order absorption rate constant was estimated to be 0.4 day-1. \nLinear clearance was 0.111 L/day and the central compartment volume (Vc) was 2.91 L. The \nMichaelis-Menten parameter values were 11.9 mg/day and 33.9 µg/mL for Vmax and Km, respectively. \nBody weight and serum alanine aminotransferase (SGPT/ALT) showed a statistically significant \ninfluence on PK, however, simulations demonstrated that no dose adjustments are required in EBC \npatients. The population predicted PK exposure parameter values (median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) \nfor Herceptin SC dosing regimens in EBC patients are shown in Table 13 below. \n \nTable 13 Population Predicted PK Exposure Values (median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) for the \nHerceptin SC 600 mg Q3W Dosing Regimen in EBC patients \n \n\nPrimary tumor \ntype and \nRegimen \n\nCycle N \nCmin \n\n(µg/mL) \nCmax \n\n(µg/mL) \nAUC0-21days \n\n(µg.day/mL) \n\nEBC 600 mg \nHerceptin SC q3w \n\nCycle 1 297 \n28.2 \n\n(14.8 - 40.9) \n79.3 \n\n(56.1 - 109) \n1065 \n\n(718 - 1504) \n\nCycle 7 \n(steady \nstate) \n\n297 \n75.0 \n\n(35.1 - 123) \n149 \n\n(86.1 - 214) \n2337 \n\n(1258 - 3478) \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nTrastuzumab washout \n \nTrastuzumab washout period was assessed following subcutaneous administration using the \npopulation PK model. The results of these simulations indicate that at least 95% of patients will reach \nconcentrations that are <1 μg/mL (approximately 3% of the population predicted Cmin,ss, or about 97% \nwashout) by 7 months. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nHerceptin Intravenous  \n \nThere was no evidence of acute or multiple dose-related toxicity in studies of up to 6 months, or \nreproductive toxicity in teratology, female fertility or late gestational toxicity/placental transfer \nstudies. Herceptin is not genotoxic. A study of trehalose, a major formulation excipient did not reveal \nany toxicities. \n \nNo long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of Herceptin, \nor to determine its effects on fertility in males. \n \nHerceptin Subcutaneous  \n \nA single dose study in rabbits and a 13-week repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys were \nconducted. The rabbit study was performed to specifically examine local tolerance aspects. The 13-\nweek study was performed to confirm that the change in route of administration and the use of the \nnovel excipient recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) did not have an effect on the Herceptin \nsafety characteristics. Herceptin subcutaneous formulation was locally and systemically well tolerated. \n \nHyaluronidase is found in most tissues of the human body. Non-clinical data for recombinant human \nhyaluronidase reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity including safety pharmacology endpoints.  Reproductive toxicology studies with rHuPH20 \nrevealed embryofetal toxicity in mice at high systemic exposure, but did not show teratogenic \npotential. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n74 \n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nHerceptin 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nTrastuzumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n∑ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n∑ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n∑ If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1. What Herceptin is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Herceptin \n3. How Herceptin is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Herceptin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Herceptin is and what it is used for  \n \nHerceptin contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal \nantibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an \nantigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  HER2 is found in large amounts on \nthe surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth.  When Herceptin binds to HER2 it \nstops the growth of such cells and causes them to die.  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe Herceptin for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: \n∑ You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2. \n∑ You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) \n\nwith high levels of HER2. Herceptin may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy \nmedicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be \nprescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in combination \nwith medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of HER2 and hormone \nreceptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of female sex \nhormones). \n\n∑ You have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of HER2, when it is in combination with \nthe other cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-flououracil and cisplatin. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Herceptin  \n \nDo not use Herceptin if: \n∑ you are allergic to trastuzumab, to murine (mouse) proteins, or to any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n∑ you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen treatment. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYour doctor will closely supervise your therapy.  \n \n\n\n\n75 \n\nHeart checks \nTreatment with Herceptin alone or with a taxane may affect the heart, especially if you have ever used \nan anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat cancer).  \nThe effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function will be \nchecked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with \nHerceptin. If you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your \nheart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment \nfor heart failure or you may have to stop Herceptin treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Herceptin if: \n \n∑ you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high \n\nblood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood \npressure medicine.  \n\n \n∑ you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines \n used to treat cancer).  These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle \n and increase the risk of heart problems with Herceptin. \n \n∑ you suffer from breathlessness., especially if you are currently using a taxane. Herceptin can \n\ncause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you \nare already breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment \nhave died when they were given Herceptin. \n\n \n∑ you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. \n \nIf you receive Herceptin with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an \naromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient \ninformation leaflets for these products.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nHerceptin is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Herceptin \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or may take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Herceptin to be removed from the body. Therefore you should tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had Herceptin if you start any new medicine in the 7 months \nafter stopping treatment. \n \nPregnancy  \n\n∑ If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine.  \n\n∑ You should use effective contraception during treatment with Herceptin and for at least \n7 months after treatment has ended.   \n\n∑ Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Herceptin during pregnancy. In \nrare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby \nwithin the womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving Herceptin. This condition \nmay be harmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not \ndeveloping fully resulting in foetal death.  \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed your baby during Herceptin therapy and for 7 months after the last dose of \nHerceptin as Herceptin may pass to your baby through your breast milk. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nHerceptin may affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines.If during treatment you experience \nsymptoms, such as dizziness, sleepiness, chills or fever, you should not drive or use machines until \nthese symptoms disappear. \n \nSodium  \nHerceptin contains less than 1 mmol of sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially sodium-free. \n \n \n3. How Herceptin is given \n \nBefore starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only \npatients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with Herceptin. Herceptin should only be given \nby a doctor or nurse. Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The \ndose of Herceptin depends on your body weight.  \n \nTwo different types (formulations) of Herceptin exist: \n• one is given as an infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion) \n• the other is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection).  \nIt is important to check the product labels to ensure that the correct formulation is being given as \nprescribed. Herceptin intravenous formulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an \nintravenous infusion only. \nYour doctor may consider switching your Herceptin intravenous treatment to Herceptin subcutaneous \ntreatment (and vice versa) if considered appropriate for you. \n \nHerceptin intravenous formulation is given as an intravenous infusion (“drip”) directly into your veins. \nThe first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health \nprofessional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. If the first dose is well tolerated \nthe next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under “Warnings and precautions”). The \nnumber of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. Your doctor will \ndiscuss this with you. \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine \nbeing prepared and given is Herceptin (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. \n \nFor early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, Herceptin is given \nevery 3 weeks. Herceptin may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer.  \n \nIf you stop using Herceptin \nDo not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the \nright time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). This helps your \nmedicine work as well as it can. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Herceptin to be removed from your body. Therefore your doctor may \ndecide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Herceptin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of these \nside effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. \n \nDuring a Herceptin infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very \ncommon (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick \n\n\n\n77 \n\n(nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing \ndifficulties, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or \nirregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. Some of these symptoms can \nbe serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nThese effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion (“drip” into your vein) and during the \nfirst few hours after the start of the infusion. They are usually temporary. You will be observed by a \nhealth care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion \nand for two hours after the start of other infusions. If you develop a reaction, they will slow down or \nstop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. The infusion may be \ncontinued after the symptoms improve. \n \nOccasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. If this happens to you, \ncontact your doctor immediately. Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later. \n \nSerious side effects \nOther side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Herceptin, not just related to an \ninfusion.

Care must be \ntaken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. Since the medicinal product does not contain any \nanti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, aseptic technique must be observed.  \n \nA vial of Herceptin aseptically reconstituted with sterile water for injections (not supplied) is \nchemically and physically stable for 48 hours at 2ºC – 8 ºC after reconstitution and must not be frozen.  \n \nAfter aseptic dilution in polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene bags containing sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, chemical and physical stability of Herceptin has been \ndemonstrated for up to 30 days at 2 oC – 8oC, and 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30°C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Herceptin infusion solution \nshould be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use \nare the responsibility of the user, and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, \nunless reconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nAseptic preparation, handling and storage:  \n \nAseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be:  \n\n∑ performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice \nrules especially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products.  \n\n∑ prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \nsafe handling of intravenous agents. \n\n∑ followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure \nmaintenance of the aseptic conditions \n\n \nEach vial of Herceptin is reconstituted with 7.2 mL of water for injections (not supplied). Use of other \nreconstitution solvents should be avoided. This yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, \ncontaining approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. A volume overage of 4 % ensures that the labelled \ndose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial.  \n \nHerceptin should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Herceptin may result in problems with the amount of \nHerceptin that can be withdrawn from the vial.  \n \nInstructions for aseptic reconstitution: \n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.2 mL of water for injections in the vial containing the \nlyophilised Herceptin, directing the stream into the lyophilised cake. \n2) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Herceptin results in a colourless to pale yellow \ntransparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates.  \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nInstructions for aseptic dilution of the reconstituted solution \n \nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n\n∑ based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose \nof 2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n\n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n   21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution)  \n \n\n∑ based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose \nof 6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n\n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n   21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution)  \n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to a \npolyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9 % sodium \nchloride solution. Do not use with glucose-containing solutions. The bag should be gently inverted to \nmix the solution in order to avoid foaming. Parenteral solutions should be inspected visually for \nparticulates and discoloration prior to administration.  \n\n\n\n84 \n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nHerceptin 600 mg solution for injection in vial \nTrastuzumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n∑ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n∑ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n∑ If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Herceptin is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Herceptin \n3. How Herceptin is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Herceptin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Herceptin is and what it is used for \n \nHerceptin contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal \nantibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an \nantigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts on \nthe surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When Herceptin binds to HER2 it \nstops the growth of such cells and causes them to die. \n \nYour doctor may prescribe Herceptin for the treatment of breast cancer when: \n∑ You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2. \n∑ You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) \n\nwith high levels of HER2. Herceptin may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy \nmedicines paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be \nprescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in combination \nwith medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of HER2 and hormone \nreceptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of female sex \nhormones). \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Herceptin \n \nDo not use Herceptin if: \n∑ you are allergic to trastuzumab (the active substance of Herceptin), murine (mouse) proteins, or \n\nany of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n∑ you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen treatment. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nYour doctor will closely supervise your therapy. \n \nHeart checks \nTreatment with Herceptin alone or with a taxane may affect the heart, especially if you have ever used \nan anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat cancer). The \neffects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function will be \nchecked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with \nHerceptin. If you develop any signs of heart failure (i.e. inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), \n\n\n\n85 \n\nyour heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive \ntreatment for heart failure or you may have to stop Herceptin treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Herceptin if: \n∑ you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high \n\nblood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood \npressure medicine. \n\n∑ you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines \nused to treat cancer). These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle \nand increase the risk of heart problems with Herceptin. \n\n∑ you suffer from breathlessness, especially if you are currently using a taxane. Herceptin can \ncause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you \nare already breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment \nhave died when they were given Herceptin. \n\n∑ you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. \n \nIf you receive Herceptin with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an \naromatase inhibitor, carboplatin or cisplatin you should also read the patient information leaflets for \nthese products. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nHerceptin is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Herceptin \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Herceptin to be removed from the body. Therefore you should tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had Herceptin if you start any new medicine in the 7 months \nafter stopping treatment. \n \nPregnancy  \n∑ If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, you must tell \n\nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine.  \n∑ You should use effective contraception during treatment with Herceptin and for at least \n\n7 months after treatment has ended.  \n \n\nYour doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Herceptin during pregnancy. In rare \ncases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby within the \nwomb has been observed in pregnant women receiving Herceptin. This condition may be harmful to \nyour baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not developing fully resulting in foetal \ndeath.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed your baby during Herceptin therapy and for 7 months after the last dose of \nHerceptin as Herceptin may pass to your baby through your breast milk. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHerceptin may affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. If during treatment, you \nexperience symptoms, such as dizziness, sleepiness, chills or fever, you should not drive or use \nmachines until these symptoms disappear. \n \nSodium  \nHerceptin contains less than 1 mmol of sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially sodium-free. \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n3. How Herceptin is given \n \nBefore starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only \npatients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with Herceptin. Herceptin should only be given \nby a doctor or nurse.  \n \n Two different types (formulations) of Herceptin exist: \n∑ one is given as an infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion) \n∑ the other is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection).  \nIt is important to check the product labels to ensure that the correct formulation is being given as \nprescribed. Herceptin subcutaneous fixed dose formulation is not for intravenous use and should be \ngiven as a subcutaneous injection only. \n\nYour doctor may consider switching your Herceptin intravenous treatment to Herceptin subcutaneous \ntreatment (and vice versa) if considered appropriate for you. \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is also important to check the vial labels to ensure that the \nmedicine being prepared and given is Herceptin (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. \nThe recommended dose is 600 mg. Herceptin is given as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) \nover 2 to 5 minutes every three weeks. \n \nThe injection site should be alternated between the left and right thigh. New injections should be given \nat least 2.5 cm away from an old site. No injection should be given into areas where the skin is red, \nbruised, tender or hard. \nIf other medicines for subcutaneous use are used during the treatment course with Herceptin, a \ndifferent injection site should be used. \n \nHerceptin should not be mixed or diluted with other products. \n \nIf you stop using Herceptin \nDo not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the \nright time every three weeks. This helps your medicine work as well as it can. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Herceptin to be removed from your body. Therefore your doctor may \ndecide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of \nthese side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. \n \nDuring treatment with Herceptin, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very \ncommon (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Other symptoms are: feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, \npain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing difficulties, high or low \nblood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or irregular heart beat), \nswelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. Some of these symptoms can be serious and some \npatients have died (see the section “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nYou will be observed by a healthcare professional during the administration and for six hours after the \nstart of the first administration and for two hours after the start of other administrations.  \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nSerious side effects \nOther side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Herceptin. Tell a doctor or nurse \nstraight away, if you notice any of the following side effects:  \n \n∑ Heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has \n\nstopped and can be serious. They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to heart \nfailure, inflammation of the lining around the heart and heart rhythm disturbances. This can lead to \nsymptoms such as breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid retention \n(swelling) in the legs or arms, palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart beat) (see section 2. \nHeart checks).  \n\n \nYour doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell your \ndoctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms. \n\n \n∑ Tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment \n\ncharacterized by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of calcium). \nSymptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and confusion), \nheart problems (fluttering of the heart or a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, vomiting or \ndiarrhoea and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet \n\n \nIf you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with Herceptin has finished, you \nshould see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with Herceptin. \n \nTwo different types (formulations) of Herceptin exist:  \n\n∑ one is given as an infusion into a vein over 30 to 90 minutes \n∑  the other is given as a subcutaneous injection over 2 to 5 minutes.  \n\nIn the clinical study comparing these two formulations, infections and cardiac events leading to \nhospitalisation were more frequent with the subcutaneous formulation. There were also more local \nreactions at the site of injection and more increases in blood pressure. Other side effects were similar.  \n \nVery common side effects of Herceptin: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n \n∑ infections \n∑ diarrhoea \n∑ constipation \n∑ heartburn (dyspepsia) \n∑ fatigue \n∑ skin rashes \n∑ chest pain \n∑ abdominal pain \n∑ joint pain \n∑ low counts of red blood cells and white blood cells (which help fight infection) sometimes with \n\nfever \n∑ muscle pain \n∑ conjunctivitis \n∑ watery eyes \n∑ nose bleeds \n∑ runny nose \n∑ hair loss \n∑ tremor \n∑ hot flush \n∑ dizziness \n∑ nail disorders \n∑ weight loss  \n∑ loss of appetite \n\n\n\n88 \n\n∑ inability to sleep (insomnia) \n∑ altered taste \n∑ low platelet count \n∑ bruising \n∑ numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes  \n∑ redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat \n∑ pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or feet \n∑ breathlessness \n∑ headache \n∑ cough \n∑ vomiting \n∑ nausea \n \nCommon side effects of Herceptin: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n \n∑ allergic reactions ∑ dry mouth and skin \n∑ throat infections ∑ dry eyes \n∑ bladder and skin infections ∑ sweating \n ∑ feeling weak and unwell \n∑ inflammation of the breast ∑ anxiety \n∑ inflammation of the liver ∑ depression \n∑ kidney disorders  \n∑ increased muscle tone or tension \n\n(hypertonia) \n∑ asthma \n∑ infection of lungs \n\n∑ pain in the arms and/or legs ∑ lung disorders \n∑ itchy rash ∑ back pain \n∑ sleepiness (somnolence) ∑ neck pain \n∑ haemorrhoids ∑ bone pain \n∑ itchiness \n \n\n∑ acne \n∑ leg cramps \n\n  \n  \n\nUncommon side effects of Herceptin: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n \n∑ deafness \n∑ bumpy rash \n∑ wheezing \n∑ inflammation or scarring of the lungs \n \nRare side effects of Herceptin: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n \n∑ jaundice \n \n∑  anaphylactic reactions \n \nOther side effects that have been reported with Herceptin use: frequency cannot be estimated from \nthe available data \n \n∑ abnormal or impaired blood clotting \n∑ high potassium levels \n∑ swelling or bleeding at the back of the eyes \n∑ shock \n∑ abnormal heart rhythm \n∑ respiratory distress \n\n\n\n89 \n\n∑ respiratory failure \n∑ acute accumulation of fluid in the lungs \n∑ acute narrowing of the airways \n∑ abnormally low oxygen levels in the blood \n∑ difficulty in breathing when lying flat \n∑ liver damage \n∑ swelling of the face, lips and throat \n∑ kidney failure \n∑ abnormally low levels of fluid around baby in womb \n∑ failure of the lungs of the baby to develop in the womb  \n∑ abnormal development of the kidneys of the baby in the womb  \n \nSome of the side effects you experience may be due to your underlying breast cancer.
