NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nExtavia 250 microgram/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nExtavia contains 300 microgram (9.6 million IU) of recombinant interferon beta-1b per vial*. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution, each ml contains 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) of recombinant interferon beta-\n\n1b. \n\n \n\n* produced by genetic engineering from strain of Escherichia coli. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\n \n\nPowder - white to off-white in colour. \n\nSolvent - clear/colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nExtavia is indicated for the treatment of: \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe \nenough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been \n\nexcluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple \n\nsclerosis (see section 5.1). \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and two or more relapses within the last two \nyears. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease, evidenced by \nrelapses. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nThe treatment with Extavia should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ntreatment of the disease. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults and adolescents from 12-17 years of age \n\nThe recommended dose of Extavia is 250 microgram (8.0 million IU), contained in 1 ml of the \n\nreconstituted solution (see section 6.6), to be injected subcutaneously every other day. \n\n \n\nGenerally, dose titration is recommended at the start of treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients should be started at 62.5 microgram (0.25 ml) subcutaneously every other day, and increased \n\nslowly to a dose of 250 microgram (1.0 ml) every other day (see Table A). The titration period may be \n\nadjusted, if any significant adverse reaction occurs. In order to obtain adequate efficacy, a dose of \n\n250 microgram (1.0 ml) every other day should be reached. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nTable A Schedule for dose titration* \n\n \n\nTreatment day Dose Volume  \n\n1, 3, 5 62.5  microgram 0.25 ml \n\n7, 9, 11 125 microgram 0.5  ml \n\n13, 15, 17 187.5 microgram 0.75 ml \n\n\u2265 19 250 microgram 1.0 ml \n\n* The titration period may be adjusted if any significant adverse reaction occurs. \n\n \n\nThe optimal dose has not been fully clarified. \n\n \n\nAt the present time, it is not known for how long the patient should be treated. There are follow-up \n\ndata under controlled clinical conditions for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for up \n\nto 5 years and for patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis for up to 3 years. For \n\nrelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, efficacy has been demonstrated for therapy for the first two \n\nyears. The available data for the additional three years are consistent with sustained treatment efficacy \n\nof Extavia over the whole time period. \n\n \n\nIn patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis, efficacy has been demonstrated \n\nover a period of three years. \n\n \n\nTreatment is not recommended in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who have \n\nexperienced less than 2 relapses in the previous 2 years or in patients with secondary-progressive \n\nmultiple sclerosis who have had no active disease in the previous 2 years. \n\n \n\nIf the patient fails to respond, for example a steady progression in Expanded Disability Status Scale \n\n(EDSS) for 6 months occurs or treatment with at least 3 courses of adrenocorticotropic hormone \n\n(ACTH) or corticosteroids during a one-year period is required despite Extavia therapy, treatment with \n\nExtavia should be stopped. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \n\nHowever, limited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents from 12 to 17 years of \n\nage receiving Extavia 8.0 million IU subcutaneously every other day is similar to that seen in adults. \n\nNo data are available on the use of Extavia in children under 12 years of age and therefore Extavia \n\nshould not be used in this population. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nThe reconstituted solution is to be injected subcutaneously every other day. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\uf02d Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta, human albumin or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\uf02d Patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n\uf02d Patients with decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nThe administration of cytokines to patients with a pre-existing monoclonal gammopathy has been \n\nassociated with the development of systemic capillary leak syndrome with shock-like symptoms and \n\nfatal outcome. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nCases of pancreatitis were observed with Extavia use, often associated with hypertriglyceridaemia. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n \n\nExtavia should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders, \n\nin particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \n\nideation are known to occur with increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \n\nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Extavia should be advised to immediately report \n\nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \n\ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Extavia and treated appropriately. \n\nCessation of therapy with Extavia should be considered (see also sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nExtavia should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to patients receiving \n\ntreatment with anti-epileptics, and in particular to patients with epilepsy who are not adequately \n\ncontrolled with anti-epileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains human albumin and hence carries a potential risk for transmission of \n\nviral diseases. A risk for transmission of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests \n\n \n\nRegular thyroid function tests are recommended in patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction or as \n\nclinically indicated. \n\n \n\nIn addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, \n\ncomplete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, \n\nincluding liver function tests (e.g. aspartate aminotransferase serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \n\n(SGOT), alanine aminotransferase serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and gamma \n\nglutamyltransferase), are recommended prior to initiation and at regular intervals following \n\nintroduction of Extavia therapy, and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. \n\n \n\nPatients with anaemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia (alone or in any combination) may require \n\nmore intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. Patients \n\nwho develop neutropenia should be monitored closely for the development of fever or infection. There \n\nhave been reports of thrombocytopenia, with profound decreases in platelet count. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n \n\nAsymptomatic elevations of serum transaminases, in most cases mild and transient, occurred very \n\ncommonly in patients treated with Extavia during clinical trials. As for other beta interferons, cases of \n\nsevere hepatic injury, including hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with Extavia. \n\nThe most serious events often occurred in patients exposed to other medicinal products or substances \n\nknown to be associated with hepatotoxicity or in the presence of co-morbid medical conditions (e.g. \n\nmetastasising malignant disease, severe infection and sepsis, alcohol abuse). \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury. The occurrence of elevations in serum \n\ntransaminases should lead to close monitoring and investigation. Withdrawal of Extavia should be \n\nconsidered if the levels significantly increase or if they are associated with clinical symptoms such as \n\njaundice. In the absence of clinical evidence for liver damage, and after normalisation of liver \n\nenzymes, a reintroduction of therapy could be considered with appropriate follow-up of hepatic \n\nfunctions. \n\n \n\nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and haemolytic anaemia (HA) \n\n \n\nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \n\nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \n\nproducts. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central \n\nnervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings \n\nsuggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \n\ndue to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical \n\nfeatures of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and \n\nrenal function is recommended. Additionally, cases of HA not associated with TMA, including \n\nimmune HA, have been reported with interferon beta products. Life-threatening and fatal cases have \n\nbeen reported. Cases of TMA and/or HA have been reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. If TMA \n\nand/or HA is diagnosed, and a relationship to Extavia is suspected, prompt treatment is required (in \n\ncase of TMA considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Extavia is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n \n\nCaution should be used and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta to \n\npatients with severe renal failure. \n\n \n\nNephrotic syndrome \n\nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \n\nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \n\nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \n\ntreatment with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \n\nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \n\nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function, is recommended, especially in \n\npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \n\ndiscontinuation of treatment with Extavia should be considered. \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\nExtavia should also be used with caution in patients who suffer from pre-existing cardiac disorders. \n\nPatients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease, such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery \n\ndisease or arrhythmia, should be monitored for worsening of their cardiac condition, particularly \n\nduring initiation of treatment with Extavia. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nWhile Extavia does not have any known direct-acting cardiac toxicity, symptoms of the flu-like \n\nsyndrome associated with beta interferons may prove stressful to patients with pre-existing significant \n\ncardiac disease. During the post-marketing period very rare reports have been received of temporary \n\nworsening of cardiac status at the start of Extavia therapy in patients with pre-existing significant \n\ncardiac disease. \n\n \n\nCases of cardiomyopathy have been reported. If this occurs and a relationship to Extavia is suspected, \n\ntreatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n \n\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions (severe acute reactions such as bronchospasm, anaphylaxis and \n\nurticaria) may occur. If reactions are severe, Extavia should be discontinued and appropriate medical \n\nintervention instituted. \n\n \n\nInjection site necrosis has been reported in patients using Extavia (see section 4.8). It can be extensive \n\nand may involve muscle fascia as well as fat and therefore can result in scar formation. Debridement \n\nand, less often, skin grafting are occasionally required and healing may take up to 6 months. \n\n \n\nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \n\nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with his/her physician before \n\ncontinuing injections with Extavia. \n\n \n\nIf the patient has multiple lesions Extavia should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients \n\nwith single lesions may continue on Extavia provided the necrosis is not too extensive, as some \n\npatients have experienced healing of injection site necrosis whilst on Extavia. \n\n \n\nTo minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\n\uf02d use an aseptic injection technique, \n\n\uf02d rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \n\nThe incidence of injection site reactions may be reduced by the use of an auto-injector. In the pivotal \n\nstudy of patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis an auto-injector was used \n\nin the majority of patients. Injection site reactions and necroses were observed less frequently in this \n\nstudy than in the other pivotal studies. \n\n \n\nThe procedure for self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically, especially if \n\ninjection site reactions have occurred. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In controlled clinical trials \n\nserum samples were collected every 3 months for monitoring of development of antibodies to Extavia. \n\n \n\nIn the different controlled clinical trials, between 23% and 41% of the patients developed serum \n\ninterferon beta-1b neutralising activity confirmed by at least two consecutive positive titres. Between \n\n43% and 55% of these patients converted to a stable antibody negative status (based on two \n\nconsecutive negative titres) during the subsequent observational period of the trial concerned. \n\n \n\nThe development of neutralising activity is associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy only with \n\nregard to relapse activity. Some analyses suggest that this effect might be more pronounced in patients \n\nwith higher titre levels of neutralising activity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nIn the study of patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis, neutralising \n\nactivity measured every 6 months was observed at least once in 32% (89) of the patients treated \n\nimmediately with Extavia. 60% (53) of these patients returned to negative status based on the last \n\navailable assessment within the 5-year period. Within this period, the development of neutralising \n\nactivity was associated with a significant increase in newly active lesions and T2 lesion volume on \n\nmagnetic resonance imaging. However, this did not seem to be associated with a reduction in clinical \n\nefficacy (with regard to time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS), time to confirmed EDSS \n\nprogression and relapse rate). \n\n \n\nNew adverse events have not been associated with the development of neutralising activity. \n\n \n\nIt has been demonstrated in vitro that Extavia cross-reacts with natural interferon beta. However, this \n\nhas not been investigated in vivo and its clinical significance is uncertain. \n\n \n\nThere are sparse and inconclusive data on patients who have developed neutralising activity and have \n\ncompleted Extavia therapy. \n\n \n\nThe decision to continue or discontinue treatment should be based on clinical disease activity rather \n\nthan on neutralising activity status. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-\n\nfree\u2019. \n\n \n\nLatex-sensitive individuals \n\n \n\nThe removable tip cap of the Extavia pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. \n\nAlthough no natural rubber latex is detected in the cap, the safe use of Extavia pre-filled syringe in \n\nlatex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and there is therefore a potential risk for \n\nhypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\nThe effect of alternate-day administration of 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) Extavia on drug \n\nmetabolism in multiple sclerosis patients is unknown. Corticosteroid or ACTH treatment of relapses \n\nfor periods of up to 28 days has been well tolerated in patients receiving Extavia. \n\n \n\nDue to the lack of clinical experience in multiple sclerosis patients, the use of Extavia together with \n\nimmunomodulators other than corticosteroids or ACTH is not recommended. \n\n \n\nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \n\nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when Extavia is administered in combination \n\nwith medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \n\ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. anti-epileptics. Additional caution should be exercised \n\nwith any co-medication which has an effect on the haematopoetic system. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from interferon beta registries, national \n\nregistries and post-marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies, \n\nafter pre-conception exposure or exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nHowever, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected \n\nwhen interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment was likely interrupted \n\nwhen the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and \n\nthird trimesters is very limited. \n\n \n\nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \n\nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \n\nevaluated by means of the currently available data, but the data suggest no increased risk so far. \n\n \n\nIf clinically needed, the use of Extavia may be considered during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1b into breast milk, together with the \n\nchemical / physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1b \n\nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are \n\nanticipated. \n\n \n\nExtavia can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo investigations on fertility have been conducted (see section 5.3). \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\nAdverse events related to the central nervous system associated with the use of Extavia might \n\ninfluence the ability to drive and use machines in susceptible patients. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAt the beginning of treatment adverse reactions are common but in general they subside with further \n\ntreatment. The most frequently observed adverse reactions are a flu-like symptom complex (fever, \n\nchills, arthralgia, malaise, sweating, headache, or myalgia), which is mainly due to the \n\npharmacological effects of the medicinal product, and injection site reactions. Injection site reactions \n\noccurred frequently after administration of Extavia. Redness, swelling, discolouration, inflammation, \n\npain, hypersensitivity, necrosis and non-specific reactions were significantly associated with \n\n250 microgram (8.0 million IU) Extavia treatment. \n\n \n\nThe most serious adverse reactions reported include thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and \n\nhaemolytic anaemia (HA). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nGenerally, dose titration is recommended at the start of treatment in order to increase tolerability to \n\nExtavia (see section 4.2). Flu-like symptoms may also be reduced by administration of non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory medicinal products. The incidence of injection site reactions may be reduced by the \n\nuse of an auto-injector. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nIn the following tables, the most appropriate MedDRA term is used to describe a certain reaction and \n\nits synonyms and related conditions. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse event listings are based on reports from clinical trials (Table 1, adverse events \n\nand laboratory abnormalities) and from post-marketing surveillance (Table 2, frequencies - where \n\nknown - based on pooled clinical trials (very common \uf0b31/10, common \uf0b31/100 to <1/10, uncommon \n\n\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100, rare \uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000, very rare <1/10,000)) of Extavia use. Experience \nwith Extavia in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is limited, consequently those adverse events \n\nwhich occur very rarely may not yet have been observed. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Adverse

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, interferons, ATC code: L03AB08 \n\n \n\nInterferons belong to the family of cytokines, which are naturally occurring proteins. Interferons have \n\nmolecular weights ranging from 15,000 to 21,000 Daltons. Three major classes of interferons have \n\nbeen identified: alpha, beta, and gamma. Interferon alpha, interferon beta, and interferon gamma have \n\noverlapping yet distinct biological activities. The activities of interferon beta-1b are species-restricted \n\nand therefore, the most pertinent pharmacological information on interferon beta-1b is derived from \n\nstudies of human cells in culture or human in vivo studies. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nInterferon beta-1b has been shown to possess both antiviral and immunoregulatory activity. The \n\nmechanisms by which interferon beta-1b exerts its actions in multiple sclerosis are not clearly \n\nunderstood. However, it is known that the biological response-modifying properties of interferon \n\nbeta-1b are mediated through its interactions with specific cell receptors found on the surface of \n\nhuman cells. The binding of interferon beta-1b to these receptors induces the expression of a number \n\nof gene products that are believed to be the mediators of the biological actions of interferon beta-1b. A \n\nnumber of these products have been measured in the serum and cellular fractions of blood collected \n\nfrom patients treated with interferon beta-1b. Interferon beta-1b both decreases the binding affinity \n\nand enhances the internalisation and degradation of the interferon-gamma receptor. Interferon beta-1b \n\nalso enhances the suppressor activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nNo separate investigations were performed regarding the influence of Extavia on the cardiovascular \n\nsystem, respiratory system and the function of endocrine organs. \n\n \n\nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) \n\nOne controlled clinical trial was performed with Extavia in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \n\nsclerosis and able to walk unaided (baseline EDSS 0 to 5.5). In patients receiving Extavia there was a \n\nreduction in the frequency (30%) and severity of clinical relapses and in the number of hospitalisations \n\ndue to disease. Furthermore, there was a prolongation of the relapse-free interval. There is no evidence \n\nof an effect of Extavia on the duration of relapses or on symptoms in between relapses, and no \n\nsignificant effect was seen on the progression of the disease in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. \n\n \n\nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS) \n\nTwo controlled clinical trials were performed with Extavia involving a total of 1,657 patients with \n\nsecondary progressive multiple sclerosis (baseline EDSS 3 to 6.5, i.e. patients were able to walk). \n\nPatients with mild disease and those unable to walk were not studied. The two studies showed \n\ninconsistent results for the primary endpoint time to confirmed progression, representing delay of \n\ndisability progression: \n\n \n\nOne of the two studies demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the time to disability \n\nprogression (Hazard Ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (0.55, 0.86), p=0.0010, corresponding to a \n\n31% risk reduction due to Extavia) and in the time to becoming wheelchair-bound (Hazard Ratio = \n\n0.61, 95% confidence interval (0.44, 0.85), p=0.0036, corresponding to a 39% risk reduction due to \n\nExtavia) in patients who received Extavia. This effect continued over the observation period of up to \n\n33 months. The treatment effect occurred in patients at all levels of disability investigated and \n\nindependent of relapse activity. \n\n \n\nIn the second trial of Extavia in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, no delay in the time to \n\ndisability progression was observed. There is evidence that the patients included in this study had \n\noverall less active disease than in the other study in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. \n\n \n\nIn retrospective meta-analyses including the data of both studies, a statistically significant overall \n\ntreatment effect was found (p=0.0076; 8.0 million IU Extavia versus all placebo patients). \n\n \n\nRetrospective analyses in subgroups showed that a treatment effect on disability progression is most \n\nlikely in patients with active disease before treatment commences (Hazard Ratio 0.72, 95% confidence \n\ninterval (0.59, 0.88), p=0.0011, corresponding to a 28% risk reduction due to Extavia in patients with \n\nrelapses or pronounced EDSS progression, 8.0 million IU Extavia versus all placebo patients). From \n\nthese retrospective subgroup analyses there was evidence to suggest that relapses as well as \n\npronounced EDSS progression (EDSS >1 point or >0.5 point for EDSS >=6 in the previous two years) \n\ncan help to identify patients with active disease. \n\n \n\nIn both trials there was a reduction (30%) in frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary \n\nprogressive multiple sclerosis patients receiving Extavia. There is no evidence of Extavia having an \n\neffect on the duration of relapses. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nSingle clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis \n\nOne controlled clinical trial with Extavia was performed in patients with a single clinical event and \n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features suggestive of multiple sclerosis (at least two clinically \n\nsilent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI). Patients with monofocal or multifocal onset of the disease \n\nwere included (i.e. patients with clinical evidence of a single or at least two lesions, respectively, of \n\nthe central nervous system). Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs \n\nand symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. This study consisted of two phases, a placebo-\n\ncontrolled phase followed by a pre-planned follow-up phase. The placebo-controlled phase lasted for \n\n2 years or until the patient developed clinically definite multiple scleroiss (CDMS), whichever came \n\nfirst. After the placebo-controlled phase, patients entered a pre-planned follow-up phase with Extavia \n\nto evaluate the effects of immediate versus delayed start of Extavia treatment, comparing patients \n\ninitially randomised to Extavia (\u201cimmediate treatment group\u201d) or to placebo (\u201cdelayed treatment \n\ngroup\u201d). Patients and investigators remained blinded to the initial treatment allocation. \n\n \n\nIn the placebo-controlled phase, Extavia delayed the progression from the first clinical event to \n\nclinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful \n\nmanner, corresponding to a risk reduction of 47% (Hazard Ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval \n\n(0.39, 0.73), p<0.0001). Within the study period of two years, CDMS occurred in 45% of the placebo \n\ngroup compared to 28% of the Extavia group (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Extavia prolonged the time to \n\nCDMS by 363 days, from 255 days in the placebo group to 618 days in the Extavia group (based on \n\nthe 25th percentiles). This treatment effect was still evident after the additional year of follow-up at \n\nwhich stage the risk reduction was 41% (Hazard Ratio = 0.59, 95% confidence interval (0.42, 0.83), \n\np=0.0011). Within the study period of three years, CDMS occurred in 51% of the delayed treatment \n\ngroup compared to 37% of the immediate treatment group (Kaplan-Meier estimates). The persistence \n\nof the treatment effect was observed although the majority of patients from the placebo-group was \n\ntreated with Extavia in the third year of the study. \n\n \n\nThe robustness of the treatment effect was also shown by the delay of progression to multiple sclerosis \n\naccording to the McDonald criteria. In two years, the risk was 85% in the placebo group and 69% in \n\nthe Extavia group (Hazard Ratio = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (0.46, 0.71), p<0.00001). \n\n \n\nAfter 3 years, a pre-planned interim analysis showed EDSS progression (confirmed increase in EDSS \n\nof greater than or equal to 1.0 compared to baseline) occurred in 24% of the patients in the delayed \n\ntreatment group compared to 16% in the immediate treatment group [Hazard Ratio = 0.6, 95% \n\nconfidence interval (0.39, 0.92), p=0.022]. There is no evidence for benefit in terms of confirmed \n\ndisability progression in the majority of patients receiving \u201cimmediate\u201d treatment. Follow-up of \n\npatients is continuing in order to provide additional data. No benefit, attributable to Extavia, in quality \n\nof life (as measured by FAMS \u2013 Functional Assessment of MS: Treatment Outcomes Index) was seen. \n\n \n\nSubgroup analyses according to baseline factors demonstrated evidence of efficacy in all subgroups \n\nevaluated. Significant effects were also obtained in patients with less disseminated and less active \n\ndisease at the time of the first event. The risk for progression to CDMS within two years in patients \n\nwith monofocal onset was 47% for placebo and 24% for Extavia, without gadolinium (Gd-) \n\nenhancement 41% and 20%, with less than 9 T2 lesions 39% and 18%. Further subgroup analyses \n\nindicated a high risk for progression to CDMS within 2 years in monofocal patients with at least 9 T2-\n\nlesions (55% risk for placebo, 26% for Extavia) or Gd-enhancement (63% versus 33%). In multifocal \n\npatients, the risk for CDMS was independent from MRI findings at baseline, indicating a high risk for \n\nCDMS because of the dissemination of the disease based on clinical findings. However, the long-term \n\nimpact of early treatment with Extavia is unknown even in these high risk subgroups as this study was \n\nmainly designed to assess the time to CDMS rather than the long-term evolution of the disease. \n\nFurthermore, for the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a \n\nmore conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at \n\nleast one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the \n\ninitial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nTherapy with Extavia was well accepted in the study of patients with a single clinical event as \n\nindicated by a high rate of trial completion (92.8% in the Extavia group). To increase tolerability of \n\nExtavia in the study of patients with a first clinical event, a dose titration was applied and non-\n\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products were administered at start of therapy. Moreover, an \n\nautoinjector was used by the majority of patients throughout the study. \n\n \n\nRR-MS, SP-MS and single clinical event suggestive of MS \n\nIn all multiple sclerosis studies Extavia was effective in reducing disease activity (acute inflammation \n\nin the central nervous system and permanent tissue alterations) as measured by magnetic resonance \n\nimaging (MRI). The relation of multiple sclerosis disease activity as measured by MRI and clinical \n\noutcome is currently not fully understood. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nExtavia serum levels were followed in patients and volunteers by means of a bioassay that was not \n\ncompletely specific. Maximum serum levels of about 40 IU/ml were found 1-8 hours after \n\nsubcutaneous injection of 500 microgram (16.0 million IU) interferon beta-1b. From various studies \n\nmean clearance rates and half-lives of disposition phases from serum were estimated to be at most \n\n30 ml\u00b7min-1\u00b7kg-1 and 5 hours, respectively. \n\n \n\nAdministration of Extavia injections every other day does not lead to serum level increase, and the \n\npharmacokinetics do not seem to change during therapy. \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered interferon beta-1b was approximately \n\n50%. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNo acute toxicity studies have been performed. As rodents do not react to human interferon beta, \n\nrepeated dose studies were carried out with rhesus monkeys. Transitory hyperthermia was observed, as \n\nwell as a significant rise in lymphocytes and a significant decrease in thrombocytes and segmented \n\nneutrophils. \n\n \n\nNo long-term studies have been conducted. Reproduction studies with rhesus monkeys revealed \n\nmaternal toxicity and an increased rate of abortion, resulting in prenatal mortality. No malformations \n\nhave been observed in the surviving animals. \n\n \n\nNo investigations on fertility have been conducted. No influence on the monkey oestrous cycle has \n\nbeen observed. Experience with other interferons suggest a potential for impairment of male and \n\nfemale fertility. \n\n \n\nIn one single genotoxicity study (Ames test), no mutagenic effect has been observed. Carcinogenicity \n\nstudies have not been performed. An in vitro cell transformation test gave no indication of tumorigenic \n\npotential. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n Annex \u2013 self-injection procedure \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Extavia is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat Extavia is \nExtavia is a type of medicine known as interferon used to treat multiple sclerosis. Interferons are \n\nproteins produced by the body that help it fight against attacks on the immune system such as viral \n\ninfections. \n \n\nHow Extavia works \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), \n\nparticularly the functioning of the brain and spinal cord. In MS, inflammation destroys the protective \n\nsheath (called myelin) around the nerves of the CNS and stops the nerves from working properly. This \n\nis called demyelination. \n\n \n\nThe exact cause of MS is unknown. An abnormal response by the body\u2019s immune system is thought to \n\nplay an important part in the process which damages the CNS. \n\n \n\nThe damage to the CNS can occur within an MS attack (relapse). It can cause temporary disability, \n\nsuch as difficulty walking. Symptoms may disappear completely or partly. \n\n \n\nInterferon beta-1b has been shown to change the response of the immune system and to help to reduce \n\ndisease activity. \n\n \n\nHow Extavia helps fight your disease \nSingle clinical event indicating a high risk of developing multiple sclerosis: Extavia has been \n\nshown to delay progression to definite multiple sclerosis. \n\n \n\nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: People with relapsing-remitting MS have occasional attacks \n\nor relapses during which symptoms become noticeably worse. Extavia has been shown to cut down the \n\nnumber of attacks and make them less severe. It reduces the number of hospital stays due to the \n\ndisease and prolongs the time without relapses. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis: In some cases people with relapsing-remitting MS find \n\nthat their symptoms increase and they progress to another form of MS called secondary progressive \n\nMS. With this, people find themselves becoming increasingly impaired, whether or not they have \n\nrelapses. Extavia can reduce the number and severity of the attacks, and slow the progression of \n\ndisability. \n\n \n\nWhat Extavia is used for \n\nExtavia is for use in patients  \n\n\u25ba who have experienced for the first time symptoms which indicate a high risk of developing \n\nmultiple sclerosis. Your doctor will rule out any other reasons which could explain these \n\nsymptoms before you are treated. \n\n\u25ba who suffer from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with at least two relapses within \nthe last two years. \n\n\u25ba who suffer from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease shown by \n\nrelapses. \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Extavia \n \n\nDo not use Extavia \n\n- if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta, human albumin or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you currently suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts (see \u201cWarnings and \nprecautions\u201d and section 4, \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\n- if you have a severe liver disease (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d, \u201cOther medicines and \n\nExtavia\u201d and section 4, \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\n \n\n\u25ba\uf020 Tell your doctor, if any of the above applies to you. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Extavia: \n\n \n\n- If you have monoclonal gammopathy. This is a disorder of the immune system where an \n\nabnormal protein is found in the blood. Problems with your small blood vessels (capillaries) \n\nmay develop (systemic capillary leak syndrome) when using medicines like Extavia. This can \n\nlead to shock (collapse) and even be fatal. \n\n \n\n- If you have had depression or are depressed or previously had thoughts of suicide. Your \ndoctor will closely monitor you during treatment. If your depression and/or suicidal thoughts are \n\nsevere, you will not be prescribed Extavia (see also \u201cDo not use Extavia\u201d). \n\n \n\n- If you have ever had seizures or if you are taking medicines to treat epilepsy (anti-\n\nepileptics), you doctor will monitor your treatment carefully (see also \u201cOther medicines and \n\nExtavia\u201d and section 4, \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\n \n\n- If you have severe kidney problems, your doctor may monitor your kidney function during \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\n- If you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. The tip cap of the pre-filled syringe \ncontains a derivative of natural rubber latex. Therefore, the tip cap may contain natural rubber \n\nlatex. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nYour doctor also needs to know the following whilst you are using Extavia: \n\n \n\n- If you experience symptoms such as itching all over your body, swelling of your face \n\nand/or your tongue or sudden shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of a serious \n\nallergic reaction, which may become life threatening. \n\n \n\n- If you feel noticeably more sad or hopeless than before the treatment with Extavia, or if \n\nyou develop thoughts of suicide. If you become depressed while you are on Extavia, you may \n\nneed special treatment and your doctor will closely monitor you and may also consider stopping \n\nyour treatment. If you suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts, you will not be \n\ntreated with Extavia (see also \u201cDo not use Extavia\u201d). \n\n \n\n- If you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be \ncatching a lot of infections. These may be symptoms of a fall in your blood cell count or in the \n\nnumber of platelets in your blood (cells, which help the blood to clot). You may need extra \n\nmonitoring by your doctor. \n\n \n\n- If you experience loss of appetite, tiredness, feeling sick (nausea), repeated vomiting, and \nespecially if you notice widespread itching, yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the \n\neyes, or easy bruising. These symptoms may suggest problems with your liver. Changes to \n\nliver function values occurred in patients treated with Extavia during clinical studies. As for \n\nother beta interferons, severe liver damage, including cases of liver failure, have been reported \n\nrarely in patients taking Extavia. The most serious were reported in patients taking other \n\nmedicines or who were suffering from diseases that can affect the liver (e.g. alcohol abuse, \n\nsevere infection). \n\n \n\n- If you experience symptoms such as irregular heartbeat, swelling such as of the ankles or \n\nlegs, or shortness of breath. This may suggest a disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) \n\nwhich has been reported in patients using Extavia. \n\n \n\n- If you notice pain in your belly which is radiating to your back, and/or you feel sick or \nhave a fever. This may suggest an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which has been \n\nreported with Extavia use. This is often associated with an increase in certain blood fats \n\n(triglycerides). \n\n \n\n\u25ba Stop using Extavia and tell your doctor immediately if any of these happens to you. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nOther things to consider when using Extavia: \n\n \n\n- You will need blood tests to determine your blood cell count, blood chemistry and your liver \n\nenzymes. These will be performed before you start using Extavia, regularly after treatment \n\nwith Extavia has been initiated and then periodically during treatment, even if you have no \n\nparticular symptoms. These blood tests will be in addition to the tests which are normally done \n\nto monitor your MS. \n\n \n\n- If you have a heart disease, the flu-like symptoms which often occur at the start of \n\ntreatment may prove stressful to you. Extavia must be used with caution, and your doctor will \n\nmonitor you for worsening of your heart condition, particularly at the start of treatment. Extavia \n\nitself does not affect the heart directly. \n\n \n\n- The functioning of your thyroid gland will be checked regularly or whenever thought \n\nnecessary by your doctor for other reasons. \n\n \n\n- Extavia contains human albumin and therefore carries a potential risk for transmission of \nviral diseases. A risk of transmission of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) cannot be ruled out. \n\n \n\n- During treatment with Extavia your body may produce substances called neutralising \nantibodies, which may react with Extavia. It is not yet clear whether these neutralising \n\nantibodies reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. Neutralising antibodies are not produced in \n\nall patients. Currently it is not possible to predict which patients belong to this group. \n\n \n\n- During treatment with Extavia, kidney problems that may reduce your kidney function, \nincluding scarring (glomerulosclerosis), may occur. Your doctor may perform tests to check \n\nyour kidney function. \n\n \n\n- Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots \ncould affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting \n\nExtavia. Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the \n\nfunction of your kidneys. \n\n \n\n- Pale or yellow skin or dark-coloured urine, possibly accompanied by unusual dizziness, \ntiredness or shortness of breath may occur during your treatment. These may be symptoms \n\nof a breakdown of red blood cells. This might happen several weeks to several years after \n\nstarting Extavia. Your doctor may perform blood tests. Inform your doctor about other \n\nmedicines that you are taking at the same time as Extavia. \n\n \n\nInjection site reactions \n\nDuring Extavia treatment you are likely to experience injection site reactions. Symptoms include \n\nredness, swelling, change in skin colour, inflammation, pain, and hypersensitivity. Skin breakdown \n\nand tissue damage (necrosis) around the injection site are reported less frequently. Injection site \n\nreactions usually become less frequent over time. \n\n \n\nInjection site skin and tissue breakdown can result in scars forming. If this is severe a doctor may have \n\nto remove foreign matter and dead tissue (debridement) and, less often, skin grafting is required and \n\nhealing may take up to 6 months. \n\n \n\nTo reduce the risk of getting injection site reaction you must: \n\n\uf02d use a sterile (aseptic) injection technique, \n\n\uf02d rotate the injection sites with each injection (see Annex Self-Injection procedure). \n \n\nInjection site reactions may occur less frequently if you use an auto-injector device. Your doctor or \n\nnurse can tell you more about this. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nIf you experience any break in the skin, associated with swelling or fluid leaking out from the \n\ninjection site: \n\n \n\n\u25ba Stop injecting Extavia and talk to your doctor. \n \n\n\u25ba\uf020 If you have only one sore injection site (lesion) and the tissue damage (necrosis) is not too \n\nextensive you may continue using Extavia. \n \n\n\u25ba If you have more than one sore injection sites (multiple lesions) you must stop using Extavia \nuntil your skin has healed. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will regularly check the way you inject yourself, particularly if you have experienced \n\ninjection site reactions. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nThere have been no formal clinical trials undertaken in children or adolescents. \n\nHowever, there are some data available in adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years which suggest that the \n\nsafety of Extavia in this group is the same as in adults. Extavia should not be used in children under \n\n12 years of age as there is no information available for this age group. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Extavia \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nNo formal interaction studies have been carried out to find out whether Extavia affects other \n\nmedicines or is affected by them. \n\n \n\nUsing Extavia with other medicines that modify the immune system response is not recommended, \n\nexcept anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids or the adrenocorticotropic hormone \n\n(ACTH). \n\n \n\nExtavia should be used with caution with: \n\n- medicines which need a certain liver enzyme system (known as cytochrome P450 system) for \n\ntheir removal from the body, for example medicines used to treat epilepsy (such as phenytoin). \n\n- medicines which affect the production of blood cells. \n\n \n\nExtavia with food and drink \n\nExtavia is injected under the skin so any food or drink you consume is not thought to have any effect \n\non Extavia. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Extavia can be used during \n\nbreast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nExtavia may cause side effects in the central nervous system (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). If \n\nyou are especially sensitive, this might influence your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nExtavia contains sodium \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially 'sodium-\n\nfree'. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n3. How to use Extavia \n \n\nTreatment with Extavia should be started under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in the \n\ntreatment of multiple sclerosis. \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is every other day (once every two days), 1.0 ml of the prepared Extavia \n\nsolution (see Annex \u201cSelf-injection procedure\u201d in the second part of this leaflet) injected under the \n\nskin (subcutaneously). This equals 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) interferon beta-1b. \n\n \n\nIn general, treatment should be started at a low dose of 0.25 ml (62.5 microgram). Your doses will \n\nthen be increased gradually to the full dose of 1.0 ml (250 microgram). \n\nThe dose should be increased at every fourth injection in four steps (0.25 ml, 0.5 ml, 0.75 ml, 1.0 ml). \n\nYour doctor may decide together with you to change the time intervals for dose increase depending on \n\nside effects you may experience at the start of treatment. \n\n \n\nPreparing the injection \n\nBefore injection, the Extavia solution has to be prepared from a vial of Extavia powder and 1.2 ml \n\nof liquid from the pre-filled solvent syringe. This will either be done by your doctor or nurse or by \n\nyourself after you have been carefully trained. \n\n \n\nDetailed instructions for self-injection of Extavia under the skin are provided in the Annex at the \n\nback of this leaflet. These instructions also tell you how to prepare the Extavia solution for injection. \n\n \n\nThe injection site must be changed regularly. See section 2 \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d and follow \n\nthe instructions under \u201cRotating injection sites\u201d in the Annex at the back of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment \n\nAt present it is not known how long treatment with Extavia should last. The length of treatment will \n\nbe decided by your doctor together with you. \n \n\nIf you use more Extavia than you should \nGiving many times the dose of Extavia recommended for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not \n\nled to life-threatening situations. \n\n \n\n\u25ba Talk to your doctor if you inject too much Extavia or injected too often. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Extavia \n\nIf you have forgotten to give yourself an injection at the right time do it as soon as you remember and \n\nthen follow on with the next one 48 hours later. \n\n \n\nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Extavia \nTalk to your doctor if you stop or wish to stop treatment. Stopping Extavia is not known to cause acute \n\nwithdrawal symptoms. \n\n \n\n\u25ba If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nExtavia may cause serious side effects. If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n\u25ba Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Extavia: \n \n\n- if you experience symptoms such as itching all over your body, swelling of your face and/or \nyour tongue or sudden shortness of breath. \n\n \n\n- if you feel noticeably more sad or hopeless than before the treatment with Extavia, or if you \ndevelop thoughts of suicide. \n\n \n\n- if you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be catching \na lot of infections. \n\n \n\n- if you experience loss of appetite, tiredness, feeling sick (nausea), repeated vomiting, especially \nif you notice widespread itching, yellowing of the skin, or of the whites of the eyes or easy \n\nbruising. \n\n \n\n- if you experience symptoms like irregular heart beat, swelling such as of the ankles or legs, or \nshortness of breath. \n\n \n\n- if you notice pain in your belly which is radiating to your back , and/or you feel sick or have a \nfever. \n\n \n\n\u25ba Tell your doctor immediately: \n \n\n- if you get some or all of these symptoms: foamy urine, fatigue, swelling, particularly and the \nankles and eyelids, and weight gain, as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem. \n\n \n\nAt the beginning of treatment side effects are common but in general they decrease with further \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nThe most common side effects are: \n\n \n\n\u25ba Flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, painful joints, malaise, sweating, headache, or \n\nmuscular pain. These symptoms may be reduced by taking paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen. \n\n \n\n\u25ba Injection site reactions. Symptoms can be redness, swelling, discolouration, inflammation, \n\npain, hypersensitivity, tissue damage (necrosis). See \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d in section 2 \n\nfor more information and what to do if you experience an injection site reaction. These may be \n\nreduced by the use of an auto-injector device. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for \n\nfurther information. \n\n \n\nTo reduce the risk of side effects at the start of treatment, your doctor should start you on a low dose \n\nof Extavia and increase it gradually (see section 3, \u201cHow to use Extavia\u201d). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nThe following side effects listing is based on reports from clinical trials with Extavia (List 1) and \n\nfrom side effects reported on the marketed product (List 2). \n \n\nList 1:  Very common side effects which have occurred in clinical trials with Extavia (may affect \n\nmore than 1 in 10 people) and at a higher percentage than those observed with placebo. \n\nThe list also includes side effects which occurred commonly (may affect up to 1 in \n\n10 people) but were significantly associated with the treatment: \n\n \n\n- infection, abscess \n- reduced number of white blood cells, swollen lymph glands (lymphadenopathy) \n- decrease in the amount of sugar in the blood (hypoglycaemia) \n- depression, anxiety \n- headache, dizziness, sleeplessness, migraine, numbness or tingling feeling (paraesthesia) \n- eye inflammation (conjunctivitis), abnormal vision \n- ear pain \n- irregular, rapid beating or pulsation of the heart (palpitation) \n- redness and/or facial flushing due to widening of blood vessels(vasodilation), increased blood \n\npressure (hypertension) \n\n- runny nose, cough, hoarseness due to infection of the upper respiratory tract, sinusitis, cough \nincreased, shortness of breath (dyspnoea) \n\n- diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain \n- rises in the blood levels of liver enzymes (will show up in blood tests) \n- skin disorder, rash \n- muscle stiffness (hypertonia), painful muscles (myalgia), muscular debility (myasthenia), back \n\npain, pain in extremities such as fingers and toes \n\n- holding urine (urinary retention), protein in the urine (will show up in urine tests), urinary \nfrequency, inability to hold back urination (urinary incontinence), urinary urgency \n\n- painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), menstrual disorder, heavy uterine bleeding (metrorrhagia) \nespecially between menstrual periods, impotence \n\n- injection site reaction (including redness, swelling, discolouration, inflammation, pain, allergic \nreaction, see section 2 \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d), skin breakdown and tissue damage \n\n(necrosis) at injection site (see section 2 \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d) \n\n- flu-like symptoms, fever, pain, chest pain, accumulation of fluid in arm, leg or face (peripheral \noedema), lack/loss of strength (asthenia), chills, sweating, general feeling of being unwell. \n\n \n\nIn addition, the following side effects have been identified during post-marketing experience. \n\n \nList 2: Side effects reported on the marketed product (frequencies - where known - based \n\non clinical trials): \n\n \n\u25ba Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n \n\n- painful joints (arthralgia). \n\n \n\n\u25ba Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n\n- the number of red cells in the blood may fall (anaemia), \n- the thyroid gland does not work properly (too little hormone is produced) (hypothyroidism), \n- weight increase or decrease, \n- confusion, \n- abnormally rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), \n- a reddish yellow pigment (bilirubin), which is produced by your liver, may rise (this will show \n\nup in blood tests), \n\n- swollen and usually itchy patches of skin or mucous membranes (urticaria), \n\n- itching (pruritus), \n- loss of scalp hair (alopecia), \n\n- menstrual disorders (menorrhagia). \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\n\u25ba Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n\n- the number of platelets (which help the blood to clot) may fall (thrombocytopenia), \n- a certain type of blood fats (triglycerides) may increase (will show up in blood tests), see \n\nsection 2 \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d, \n\n- suicide attempts, \n\n- mood swings, \n\n- convulsion, \n\n- a specific liver enzyme (gamma GT) which is produced by your liver, may rise (this will show \n\nup in blood tests), \n\n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), \n\n- skin discolouration. \n\n \n\n\u25ba Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\n \n\n- serious allergic (anaphylactic) reactions, \n\n- the thyroid gland does not work properly(thyroid disorders), too much hormone is \n\nproduced (hyperthyroidism), \n\n- inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), see section 2 \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d, \n\n- blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic \n\nthrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uraemic syndrome).

Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or \n\nnurse will help you to learn the process of self-administration. Do not attempt to inject yourself until \n\nyou are sure that you understand how to prepare the injection solution and give the injection to \n\nyourself. \n\n \n\nPART I: STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS \n\n \n\nThe instructions include the following main steps: \n\nA) General advice \n\nB) Getting ready to inject \n\nC) Reconstituting and drawing up the solution for injection, step by step \n\nD) Making the injection manually (to make an injection with the ExtaviPro 30G auto-\n\ninjector, refer to the instructions for use provided with the auto-injector) \n\n \n\nA) General advice \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Getting off to a good start! \n \n\nYou will find that within a few weeks your treatment will become a natural part of your routine. As \n\nyou get started, you may find the following tips helpful: \n\n \n\n- Set up a permanent storage area in a convenient location out of the sight and reach of children \n\nso that your Extavia and other supplies are always easy to find. \n\nFor details on storage conditions see section 5 of the leaflet, \u201cHow to store Extavia\u201d. \n\n \n\n- Try to give yourself the injection at the same time each day. This makes it easier to remember \n\nand easier to plan a block of time when you will not be interrupted. \n\nPlease refer to section 3 of the leaflet, \u201cHow to use Extavia\u201d, for further details on how to use \n\nExtavia. \n\n \n\n- Prepare each dose only when you are ready for an injection. After mixing Extavia, you should \n\nadminister the injection immediately (if this medicine is not used immediately, see section 5 of \n\nthe leaflet, \u201cHow to store Extavia\u201d). \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Important tips to keep in mind \n \n\n- Be consistent - use this medicine as described in section 3 of the leaflet, \u201cHow to use Extavia\u201d. \n\nAlways double-check your dosage. \n\n- Keep your syringes and syringe disposal unit out of the sight and reach of children; lock the \n\nsupplies away if possible. \n\n- Never re-use syringes or needles. \n\n- Always use a sterile (aseptic) technique as described in here. \n\n- Always place the used syringes in the proper disposal unit. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nB) Getting ready to inject \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Choosing an injection site \n \n\nBefore preparing your injection, decide where you are going to inject. You should inject this medicine \n\ninto the fatty layer between the skin and muscle (that is, subcutaneously, about 8 mm to 12 mm under \n\nthe skin). The best places for injections are where the skin is loose and soft, and away from joints, \n\nnerves and bones, for example the abdomen, arm, thigh or buttocks. \n\n \n\nImportant: \n\n \n\nThe tip cap of the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. Therefore, the tip cap \n\nmay contain natural rubber latex. If you are allergic to latex, talk to your doctor before using Extavia. \n\n \n\nDo not use any area where you can feel lumps, bumps, firm knots, pain or an area that is discoloured, \n\nindented, scabbed, or where the skin is broken. Talk to your doctor or nurse about these or any other \n\nunusual conditions you may find. \n\n \n\nYou should rotate the injection site at every injection. If some areas are too difficult for you to reach, \n\nyou may need a family member or friend to help you with these injections. Follow the sequence \n\ndescribed in the schedule at the end of the Annex (see Part II \u201cRotating injection sites\u201d) and you will \n\ncome back to your first injection site area after 8 injections (16 days). This will give each injection site \n\na chance to fully recover before receiving another injection. \n\n \n\nPlease refer to the rotation schedule at the end of this Annex to learn how to choose an injection site. \n\nAn example of a medication record is also included (see Annex Part III). This should give you an idea \n\nof how you can keep track of your injection sites and dates. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Medicine \n \n\nYou will need the medicine: \n\n\uf0b7 1 Extavia vial (with powder for solution for injection) \n\n\uf0b7 1 pre-filled syringe of solvent for Extavia (sodium chloride solution) \n \n\nTo reconstitute and inject your medicine you will need to use an ExtaviPro 30G application kit \n\n(supplied separately to your medicine), which contains the following components and instructions on \n\nhow to use them: \n\n\uf0b7 Vial adapters for use when reconstituting your medicine \n\n\uf0b7 30-gauge needles for injecting your medicine \n\n\uf0b7 Alcohol swabs \n \n\nYou will also need a disposal unit for used syringes and needles. \n\n \n\nThe 30-gauge needles provided with the application kit for the administration of this medicine can be \n\nused either for manual injection OR with an ExtaviPro 30G auto-injector. \n\n \n\nFor skin disinfection use an appropriate disinfectant recommended by your pharmacist. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nC) Reconstituting and drawing up the solution for injection, step by step \n\n \n\n \n\n1 - Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before beginning \n\nthis process. \n\n \n\n2 - Remove the flip off cap from the Extavia vial. It is best to use your \n\nthumb rather than your nail, as your nail could break. Put the vial on \n\nthe table. \n\n \n\n3 - Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol swab, moving the swab in \n\none direction only. Leave the swab on top of the vial. \n\n \n\n4 - Peel back and remove the cover from the vial adapter packaging. \n\nDo not remove the vial adapter from its packaging. \n\n \n\n5 - Remove the swab from the top of the vial. \n\nUse the packaging to handle the vial adapter. Attach it to the vial by \n\npushing down until the vial adapter penetrates and locks around the \n\ntop of the vial. \n\n \n\n6 - Holding the edges securely, remove and discard the packaging \n\nensuring the vial adapter remains on the vial. \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\n7 - Take out the pre-filled solvent syringe from its package. Snap off \n\nand discard the tip of the syringe. \n\nNote: Be careful not to touch the exposed end of the syringe. Do not \n\npush the plunger. \n\n \n\n8 - Holding the vial and adapter securely, screw the syringe fully onto \n\nthe vial adapter. \n\nThis forms the syringe-vial assembly. \n\n \n\n9 - Hold the syringe-vial assembly at a slight angle. Push the plunger \n\ndown slowly so that the liquid runs down the inside of the vial. \n\nTransfer all the solvent to the vial. \n\nNote: Do not shake the vial as this may cause excessive foaming. \n\n \n\n10 - Hold the vial between your thumb and fingers. Swirl the syringe-\n\nvial assembly gently until the powder is completely dissolved. \n\nNote: Do not shake the vial. \n\n \n\n11 - Examine the solution carefully. It should be clear and contain no \n\nparticles. \n\nNote: If the solution is discoloured or contains particles, discard it and \n\nstart again with a new syringe and vial from your package. \n\nIf excessive foaming is present \u2013 which can happen if the vial is \n\nshaken or swirled too vigorously \u2013 let the vial sit undisturbed until the \n\nfoam settles. \n\n \n\n12 - Ensure the plunger stays fully pushed in before proceeding to the \n\nnext step, as it may have moved. \n\n \n\n13 - Turn the syringe-vial-assembly so that the vial is at the top. \n\nSlowly pull the plunger back to draw all of the solution into the \n\nsyringe. \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\n14 - Remove any excess air bubbles by gently tapping the syringe. \n\nPush the plunger to the 1 ml mark (or to the volume prescribed by \n\nyour doctor). \n\nNote: It may be necessary to adjust the plunger position back and forth \n\na few times to ensure the excess air bubbles are gone and there is 1 ml \n\nof solution in the syringe. \n\n \n\n15 - Unscrew the syringe, leaving the vial adapter on the vial. \n\nDispose of the vial and the remaining unused portion of the solution \n\ninto the disposal unit. \n\n \n\n16 - Take the needle out of its wrapping and screw it firmly onto the \n\ntop of the syringe. \n\n \n\n17 - Leave the needle cap on. You are now ready to manually inject \n\nyourself or to use the ExtaviPro 30G auto-injector for the \n\nadministration of Extavia. \n\nStorage after reconstitution \n\nIf, for some reason, you are not able to inject Extavia immediately, you can refrigerate the \n\nreconstituted solution for up to 3 hours before using it. Do not freeze the solution, and do not wait \n\nlonger than 3 hours to inject it. If more than 3 hours pass, discard the medicine and prepare a \n\nnew injection. When you use the solution, warm it up by holding the syringe or vial in your hands \n\nbefore injecting to avoid pain. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nD) Making the injection manually (to make an injection with the ExtaviPro 30G auto-\n\ninjector, refer to the instructions for use provided with the auto-injector) \n\n \n\n 1 - Choose a site for the injection (refer to the section \u201cChoosing an \n\ninjection site\u201d and the diagrams at the end of this leaflet) and make a \n\nnote of it in your medication record. \n\n \n\n \n\n2 - Use an alcohol swab to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the \n\nskin air-dry. Throw the swab away. \n\n \n\n3 - Remove the cap from the needle by pulling and not twisting it. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4 - Where possible gently pinch the skin together around the disinfected \n\ninjection site (to raise it up a little). \n\n \n\n5 - Holding the syringe like a pencil or a dart, push the needle straight \n\ninto the skin at a 90\u02da angle with a quick, firm motion. \n\n \n\n6 - Inject the medicine (by pushing the plunger slowly and steadily all \n\nthe way in until the syringe is empty). \n\n 7 - Discard the syringe in the disposal unit. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\nPART II: ROTATING INJECTION SITES \n\n \n\nYou need to choose a new site for each injection to allow the area time to recover and help prevent \n\ninfection. Advice on which areas to choose is given in the first part of this Annex. It is a good idea to \n\nknow where you plan to inject before you prepare your syringe. The schedule shown in the diagram \n\nbelow will help you to vary the sites appropriately. For example, give the first injection into the right \n\nside of the abdomen, choose the left side for the second injection, then move to the right thigh for the \n\nthird, and so on through the diagram until all suitable areas of the body have been used. Keep a record \n\nof where and when you last gave yourself an injection. One way to do that is to note the injection site \n\non the enclosed medication record card. \n\n \n\nBy following this schedule, you will come back to your first area (e.g. the right side of the abdomen) \n\nafter 8 injections (16 days). This is called a Rotation Cycle. On our example schedule each area is split \n\nagain into 6 injection sites (which adds up to 48 injection sites altogether), left and right: upper, \n\nmiddle and lower part of each area. If you come back to an area after one Rotation Cycle choose the \n\nmost distant injection site within this area. If an area becomes sore, talk to your doctor or nurse about \n\nchoosing other injection sites. \n\n \n\nRotation schedule \n\nTo help you rotate the injection sites appropriately, we recommend that you keep a record of the date \n\nand location of your injection. You can use the following rotation schedule. \n\n \n\nWork through each rotation cycle in turn. Each cycle will be 8 injections (16 days), given in area 1 \n\nthrough to area 8 in turn. By following this sequence, you will give each area a chance to recover \n\nbefore receiving another injection. \n\n \n\nRotation Cycle 1: Upper left section of each area \n\nRotation Cycle 2: Lower right section of each area \n\nRotation Cycle 3: Middle left section of each area \n\nRotation Cycle 4 Upper right section of each area \n\nRotation Cycle 5: Lower left section of each area \n\nRotation Cycle 6: Middle right section of each area \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nPART III: EXTAVIA Medication record \n\n \n\nInstructions for keeping track of your injection sites and dates \n\n \n\n\uf02d Start with your first injection (or your last injection if you are not a new Extavia user). \n \n\n\uf02d Select an injection site. If you have already been using Extavia start with the area that has not \nbeen used during the last rotation cycle (i.e. the past 16 days). \n\n \n\n\uf02d After your injection, fill in the used injection site and date in the table in your injection record \n(see the example: Keeping track of your injection sites and dates). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nROTATION SCHEDULE: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n AREA 1 \n\n AREA 3 \n\n AREA 5 \n\n AREA 2 \n\n AREA 4 \n\n AREA 6 \n\n AREA 8  AREA 7 \n\n10 \u2013 15 cm \nfrom groin \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nEXAMPLE OF A MEDICATION RECORD: \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what extavia is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what extavia is extavia is a type of medicine known as interferon used to treat multiple sclerosis. interferons are proteins produced by the body that help it fight against attacks on the immune system such as viral infections. how extavia works multiple sclerosis (ms) is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (cns), particularly the functioning of the brain and spinal cord. in ms, inflammation destroys the protective sheath (called myelin) around the nerves of the cns and stops the nerves from working properly. this is called demyelination. the exact cause of ms is unknown. an abnormal response by the body's immune system is thought to play an important part in the process which damages the cns. the damage to the cns can occur within an ms attack (relapse). it can cause temporary disability, such as difficulty walking. symptoms may disappear completely or partly. interferon beta-1b has been shown to change the response of the immune system and to help to reduce disease activity. how extavia helps fight your disease single clinical event indicating a high risk of developing multiple sclerosis: extavia has been shown to delay progression to definite multiple sclerosis. relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: people with relapsing-remitting ms have occasional attacks or relapses during which symptoms become noticeably worse. extavia has been shown to cut down the number of attacks and make them less severe. it reduces the number of hospital stays due to the disease and prolongs the time without relapses. secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: in some cases people with relapsing-remitting ms find that their symptoms increase and they progress to another form of ms called secondary progressive ms. with this, people find themselves becoming increasingly impaired, whether or not they have relapses. extavia can reduce the number and severity of the attacks, and slow the progression of disability. what extavia is used for extavia is for use in patients who have experienced for the first time symptoms which indicate a high risk of developing multiple sclerosis. your doctor will rule out any other reasons which could explain these symptoms before you are treated. who suffer from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with at least two relapses within the last two years. who suffer from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease shown by relapses.", "Entity_Recognition":

albumin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you currently suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts (see \"warnings and precautions\" and section 4, \"possible side effects\"). - if you have a severe liver disease (see \"warnings and precautions\", \"other medicines and extavia\" and section 4, \"possible side effects\"). tell your doctor, if any of the above applies to you. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before using extavia: - if you have monoclonal gammopathy. this is a disorder of the immune system where an abnormal protein is found in the blood. problems with your small blood vessels (capillaries) may develop (systemic capillary leak syndrome) when using medicines like extavia. this can lead to shock (collapse) and even be fatal. - if you have had depression or are depressed or previously had thoughts of suicide. your doctor will closely monitor you during treatment. if your depression and/or suicidal thoughts are severe, you will not be prescribed extavia (see also \"do not use extavia\"). - if you have ever had seizures or if you are taking medicines to treat epilepsy (anti- epileptics), you doctor will monitor your treatment carefully (see also \"other medicines and extavia\" and section 4, \"possible side effects\"). - if you have severe kidney problems, your doctor may monitor your kidney function during treatment. - if you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. the tip cap of the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. therefore, the tip cap may contain natural rubber latex. your doctor also needs to know the following whilst you are using extavia: - if you experience symptoms such as itching all over your body, swelling of your face and/or your tongue or sudden shortness of breath. these may be symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, which may become life threatening. - if you feel noticeably more sad or hopeless than before the treatment with extavia, or if you develop thoughts of suicide. if you become depressed while you are on extavia, you may need special treatment and your doctor will closely monitor you and may also consider stopping your treatment. if you suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts, you will not be treated with extavia (see also \"do not use extavia\"). - if you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be catching a lot of infections. these may be symptoms of a fall in your blood cell count or in the number of platelets in your blood (cells, which help the blood to clot). you may need extra monitoring by your doctor. - if you experience loss of appetite, tiredness, feeling sick (nausea), repeated vomiting, and especially if you notice widespread itching, yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes, or easy bruising. these symptoms may suggest problems with your liver. changes to liver function values occurred in patients treated with extavia during clinical studies. as for other beta interferons, severe liver damage, including cases of liver failure, have been reported rarely in patients taking extavia. the most serious were reported in patients taking other medicines or who were suffering from diseases that can affect the liver (e.g. alcohol abuse, severe infection). - if you experience symptoms such as irregular heartbeat, swelling such as of the ankles or legs, or shortness of breath. this may suggest a disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) which has been reported in patients using extavia. - if you notice pain in your belly which is radiating to your back, and/or you feel sick or have a fever. this may suggest an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which has been reported with extavia use. this is often associated with an increase in certain blood fats (triglycerides). stop using extavia and tell your doctor immediately if any of these happens to you. other things to consider when using extavia: - you will need blood tests to determine your blood cell count, blood chemistry and your liver enzymes. these will be performed before you start using extavia, regularly after treatment with extavia has been initiated and then periodically during treatment, even if you have no particular symptoms. these blood tests will be in addition to the tests which are normally done to monitor your ms. - if you have a heart disease, the flu-like symptoms which often occur at the start of treatment may prove stressful to you. extavia must be used with caution, and your doctor will monitor you for worsening of your heart condition, particularly at the start of treatment. extavia itself does not affect the heart directly. - the functioning of your thyroid gland will be checked regularly or whenever thought necessary by your doctor for other reasons. - extavia contains human albumin and therefore carries a potential risk for transmission of viral diseases. a risk of transmission of creutzfeld-jacob disease (cjd) cannot be ruled out. - during treatment with extavia your body may produce substances called neutralising antibodies, which may react with extavia. it is not yet clear whether these neutralising antibodies reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. neutralising antibodies are not produced in all patients. currently it is not possible to predict which patients belong to this group. - during treatment with extavia, kidney problems that may reduce your kidney function, including scarring (glomerulosclerosis), may occur. your doctor may perform tests to check your kidney function. - blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. these blood clots could affect your kidneys. this might happen several weeks to several years after starting extavia. your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your kidneys. - pale or yellow skin or dark-coloured urine, possibly accompanied by unusual dizziness, tiredness or shortness of breath may occur during your treatment. these may be symptoms of a breakdown of red blood cells. this might happen several weeks to several years after starting extavia. your doctor may perform blood tests. inform your doctor about other medicines that you are taking at the same time as extavia. injection site reactions during extavia treatment you are likely to experience injection site reactions. symptoms include redness, swelling, change in skin colour, inflammation, pain, and hypersensitivity. skin breakdown and tissue damage (necrosis) around the injection site are reported less frequently. injection site reactions usually become less frequent over time. injection site skin and tissue breakdown can result in scars forming. if this is severe a doctor may have to remove foreign matter and dead tissue (debridement) and, less often, skin grafting is required and healing may take up to 6 months. to reduce the risk of getting injection site reaction you must: use a sterile (aseptic) injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each injection (see annex self-injection procedure). injection site reactions may occur less frequently if you use an auto-injector device. your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this. if you experience any break in the skin, associated with swelling or fluid leaking out from the injection site: stop injecting extavia and talk to your doctor. if you have only one sore injection site (lesion) and the tissue damage (necrosis) is not too extensive you may continue using extavia. if you have more than one sore injection sites (multiple lesions) you must stop using extavia until your skin has healed. your doctor will regularly check the way you inject yourself, particularly if you have experienced injection site reactions. children and adolescents there have been no formal clinical trials undertaken in children or adolescents. however, there are some data available in adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years which suggest that the safety of extavia in this group is the same as in adults. extavia should not be used in children under 12 years of age as there is no information available for this age group. other medicines and extavia tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. no formal interaction studies have been carried out to find out whether extavia affects other medicines or is affected by them. using extavia with other medicines that modify the immune system response is not recommended, except anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids or the adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth). extavia should be used with caution with: - medicines which need a certain liver enzyme system (known as cytochrome p450 system) for their removal from the body, for example medicines used to treat epilepsy (such as phenytoin). - medicines which affect the production of blood cells. extavia with food and drink extavia is injected under the skin so any food or drink you consume is not thought to have any effect on extavia. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. no harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. extavia can be used during breast-feeding. driving and using machines extavia may cause side effects in the central nervous system (see section 4 \"possible side effects\"). if you are especially sensitive, this might influence your ability to drive or use machines. extavia contains sodium this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially 'sodium- free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "extavia", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 10, "BeginOffset": 11, "EndOffset": 18, "Score": 0.5600601434707642,

ml of liquid from the pre-filled solvent syringe. this will either be done by your doctor or nurse or by yourself after you have been carefully trained. detailed instructions for self-injection of extavia under the skin are provided in the annex at the back of this leaflet. these instructions also tell you how to prepare the extavia solution for injection. the injection site must be changed regularly. see section 2 \"warnings and precautions\" and follow the instructions under \"rotating injection sites\" in the annex at the back of this leaflet. duration of treatment at present it is not known how long treatment with extavia should last. the length of treatment will be decided by your doctor together with you. if you use more extavia than you should giving many times the dose of extavia recommended for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not led to life-threatening situations. talk to your doctor if you inject too much extavia or injected too often. if you forget to use extavia if you have forgotten to give yourself an injection at the right time do it as soon as you remember and then follow on with the next one 48 hours later. do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose. if you stop using extavia talk to your doctor if you stop or wish to stop treatment. stopping extavia is not known to cause acute withdrawal symptoms. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "extavia", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text":
