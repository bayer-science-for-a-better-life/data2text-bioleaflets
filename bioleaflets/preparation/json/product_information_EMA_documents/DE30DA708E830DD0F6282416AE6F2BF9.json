NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira 100 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach ml contains 100 mg of levetiracetam.\n\nEach 5 ml vial contains 500 mg of levetiracetam.\n\nExcipient with known effect:\n\nEach vial contains 19 mg of sodium.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate).\n\nClear, colourless solution\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed\nepilepsy.\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira is indicated as adjunctive therapy\n• in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults,\n\nadolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy.\n• in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile \n\nMyoclonic Epilepsy.\n• in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years \n\nof age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira concentrate is an alternative for patients when oral administration is temporarily \nnot feasible.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nLevetiracetam therapy can be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration.\n\nConversion to or from oral to intravenous administration can be done directly without titration. The total \ndaily dose and frequency of administration should be maintained.\n\nMonotherapy for adults and adolescents from 16 years of age\nThe recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily which should be increased to an initial therapeutic \ndose of 500 mg twice daily after two weeks. The dose can be further increased by 250 mg twice daily \nevery two weeks depending upon the clinical response. The maximum dose is 1,500 mg twice daily.\n\nAdd-on therapy for adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more\nThe initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of treatment.\n\nDepending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg\ntwice daily. Dose changes can be made in 500 mg twice daily increases or decreases every two to four\nweeks.\n\nDuration of treatment\n\nThere is no experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for longer period than 4 days.\n\nDiscontinuation\n\nIf levetiracetam has to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually (e.g. in adults and \nadolescents weighing more than 50 kg: 500 mg decreases twice daily every two to four weeks; in children \nand adolescents weighting less than 50 kg: dose decrease should not exceed 10 mg/kg twice daily every \ntwo weeks). \n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (65 years and older)\nAdjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function (see “Renal \nimpairment” below).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe daily dose must be individualised according to renal function.\n\nFor adult patients, refer to the following table and adjust the dose as indicated. To use this dosing table, an \nestimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in ml/min is needed. The CLcr in ml/min may be \nestimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for adults and adolescents weighting 50 kg or \nmore, the following formula:\n\n[140-age (years)] x weight (kg)\nCLcr (ml/min) = ----------------------------------------- (x 0.85 for women)\n\n72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl)\n\n\n\n4\n\nThen CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:\n\nCLcr (ml/min)\nCLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) = ---------------------------- x 1.73\n\nBSA subject (m2)\n\nDosing adjustment for adult and adolescents patients weighing more than 50 kg with impaired renal\nfunction:\n\nGroup Creatinine clearance \n(ml/min/1.73m2)\n\nDose and frequency\n\nNormal ≥80 500 to 1,500 mg twice daily\nMild 50-79 500 to 1,000 mg twice daily\nModerate 30-49 250 to 750 mg twice daily\nSever <30 250 to 500 mg twice daily\nEnd-stage renal disease patients \nundergoing dialysis(1)\n\n- 500 to 1,000 mg once daily(2)\n\n(1) A 750 mg loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with levetiracetam.\n(2) Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.\n\nFor children with renal impairment, levetiracetam dose needs to be adjusted based on the renal function as \nlevetiracetam clearance is related to renal function. This recommendation is based on a study in adult \nrenally impaired patients.\n\nThe CLcr in ml/min/1.73 m2 may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for young \nadolescents and children using the following formula (Schwartz formula):\n\nHeight (cm) x ks\nCLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) = ------------------------------------\n\nSerum Creatinine (mg/dl)\n\nks= 0.55 in Children to less than 13 years and in adolescent female; ks= 0.7 in adolescent male\n\nDosing adjustment for children and adolescents patients weighing less than 50 kg with impaired renal\nfunction:\nGroup Creatinine clearance \n\n(ml/min/1.73 m2)\nDose and frequency\nChildren from 4 years and adolescents \nweighing less than 50 kg\n\nNormal ≥80 10 to 30 mg/kg (0.10 to 0.30 ml/kg) twice \ndaily\n\nMild 50-79 10 to 20 mg/kg (0.10 to 0.20 ml/kg) twice \ndaily\n\nModerate 30-49 5 to 15 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.15 ml/kg) twice \ndaily\n\nSevere <30 5 to 10 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.10 ml/kg) twice \ndaily\n\nEnd-stage renal disease patients \nundergoing dialysis\n\n-- 10 to 20 mg/kg (0.10 to 0.20 ml/kg) once \ndaily (1)(2)\n\n(1) A 15 mg/kg (0.15 ml/kg) loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with\nlevetiracetam.\n\n(2) Following dialysis, a 5 to 10 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.10 ml/kg) supplemental dose is recommended.\n\n\n\n5\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with\nsevere hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate the renal insufficiency.\nTherefore a 50% reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine clearance \nis < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form, presentation and strength\naccording to age, weight and dose.\n\nMonotherapy\nThe safety and efficacy of levetiracetam in children below and adolescents 16 years as monotherapy\ntreatment have not been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nAdd-on therapy for children aged 4 to 11 years and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing less than 50 kg\nThe initial therapeutic dose is 10 mg/kg twice daily.\nDepending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the dose can be increased up to 30 mg/kg twice\ndaily. Dose changes should not exceed increases or decreases of 10 mg/kg twice daily every two weeks. \nThe lowest effective dose should be used.\n\nDose in children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults.\n\nDose recommendations for children and adolescents:\n\nWeight Starting dose:\n10 mg/kg twice daily\n\nMaximum dose:\n30 mg/kg twice daily\n\n15 kg(1) 150 mg twice daily 450 mg twice daily\n20 kg(1) 200 mg twice daily 600 mg twice daily\n25 kg 250 mg twice daily 750 mg twice daily\nFrom 50 kg(2) 500 mg twice daily 1,500 twice daily\n(1) Children 25 kg or less should preferably start the treatment with levetiracetam 100 mg/ml oral solution.\n(2) Dose in children and adolescents 50 kg or more is the same as in adults.\n\nAdd-on therapy for infants and children less than 4 years\nThe safety and efficacy of levetiracetam concentrate for solution for infusion in infants and children less \nthan 4 years have not been established.\n\nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology \ncan be made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira concentrate is for intravenous use only and the recommended dose must be diluted \nin at least 100 ml of a compatible diluent and administered intravenously as a 15-minute intravenous \ninfusion (see section 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients listed \nin section 6.1.\n\n\n\n6\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe administration of levetiracetam to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In \npatients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before \ndose selection (see section 4.2).\n\nAcute kidney injury\n\nThe use of levetiracetam has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury with a time to onset \nranging from a few days to several months. \n\nBlood cell count\n\nRare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \nand pancytopenia) have been described in association with levetiracetam administration, generally at the \nbeginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in patients experiencing important \nweakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders (section 4.8).\n\nSuicide\n\nSuicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with \nantiepileptic agents (including levetiracetam). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. The\nmechanism of this risk is not known.\n\nTherefore patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and behaviours \nand appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to \nseek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\n\nAbnormal and aggressive behaviours \n\nLevetiracetam may cause psychotic symptoms and behavioural abnormalities including irritability and \naggressiveness. Patients treated with levetiracetam should be monitored for developing psychiatric signs \nsuggesting important mood and/or personality changes. If such behaviours are noticed, treatment \nadaptation or gradual discontinuation should be considered. If discontinuation is considered, please refer \nto section 4.2.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nAvailable data in children did not suggest impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects on \nlearning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children remain \nunknown.\n\n\n\n7\n\nExcipients\n\nThis medicinal product contains 2.5 mmol (or 57 mg) sodium per maximum single dose (0.8 mmol (or \n19 mg) per vial). To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAntiepileptic medicinal products\n\nPre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that levetiracetam did not influence \nthe serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic \nacid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.\n\nAs in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric \npatients receiving up to 60 mg/kg/day levetiracetam.\n\nA retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with epilepsy (4 to \n17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not influence the \nsteady-state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered carbamazepine and valproate. However, \ndata suggested a 20% higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic \nmedicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required.\n\nProbenecid\n\nProbenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to inhibit \nthe renal clearance of the primary metabolite, but not of levetiracetam. Nevertheless, the concentration of \nthis metabolite remains low. \n\nMethotrexate\n\nConcomitant administration of levetiracetam and methotrexate has been reported to decrease methotrexate \nclearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to potentially toxic levels. \nBlood methotrexate and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated \nconcomitantly with the two drugs.\n\nOral contraceptives and other pharmacokinetics interactions\n\nLevetiracetam 1,000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinyl-\nestradiol and levonorgestrel); endocrine parameters (luteinizing hormone and progesterone) were not \nmodified. Levetiracetam 2,000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and warfarin; \nprothrombin times were not modified. Co-administration with digoxin, oral contraceptives and warfarin \ndid not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.\n\nAlcohol\n\nNo data on the interaction of levetiracetam with alcohol are available.\n\n\n\n8\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of child bearing potential\n\nSpecialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. Treatment with \nlevetiracetam should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become pregnant. As with all antiepileptic \nmedicines, sudden discontinuation of levetiracetam should be avoided as this may lead to breakthrough \nseizures that could have serious consequences for the woman and the unborn child. Monotherapy should \nbe preferred whenever possible because therapy with multiple antiepileptic medicines AEDs could be \nassociated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than monotherapy, depending on the associated \nantiepileptics.\n\nPregnancy \n\nA large amount of post-marketing data on pregnant women exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy (more \nthan 1800, among which in more than 1500 exposure occurred during the 1st trimester) do not suggest an \nincrease in the risk for major congenital malformations. Only limited evidence is available on the \nneurodevelopment of children exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy in utero. However, current \nepidemiological studies (on about 100 children) do not suggest an increased risk of neurodevelopmental \ndisorders or delays. \n\nLevetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, if after careful assessment it is considered clinically needed. \nIn such case, the lowest effective dose is recommended. \n\nPhysiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in \nlevetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more \npronounced during the third trimester (up to 60% of baseline concentration before pregnancy). \nAppropriate clinical management of pregnant women treated with levetiracetam should be ensured. \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nLevetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended. However, \nif levetiracetam treatment is needed during breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment should be \nweighed considering the importance of breastfeeding.\n\nFertility\n\nNo impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, \npotential risk for human is unknown.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLevetiracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to possible \ndifferent individual sensitivity, some patients might experience somnolence or other central nervous \nsystem related symptoms, especially at the beginning of treatment or following a dose increase. Therefore, \ncaution is recommended in those patients when performing skilled tasks, e.g. driving vehicles or operating \nmachinery. Patients are advised not to drive or use machines until it is established that their ability to \nperform such activities is not affected.\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis, somnolence, headache, fatigue and \ndizziness. The adverse reaction profile presented below is based on the analysis of pooled \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials with all indications studied, with a total of 3,416 patients treated with \nlevetiracetam. These data are supplemented with the use of levetiracetam in corresponding open-label \nextension studies, as well as post-marketing experience. The safety profile of levetiracetam is generally \nsimilar across age groups (adult and paediatric patients) and across the approved epilepsy indications. \nSince there was limited exposure for levetiracetam intravenous use and since oral and intravenous \nformulations are bioequivalent, the safety information of levetiracetam intravenous will rely on\nlevetiracetam oral use.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions reported in clinical studies (adults, adolescents, children and infants > 1 month) and\nfrom post-marketing experience are listed in the following table per System Organ Class and per\nfrequency. Adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness and their frequency is \ndefined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); \nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000).\n\n\n\n10\n\nMedDRA SOC\nFrequency category\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nNasopharyngitis Infection\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nThrombocytopenia, \nleukopenia\n\nPancytopenia, \nneutropenia\nagranulocytosis\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nDrug reaction \nwith \neosinophilia and \nsystemic \nsymptoms \n(DRESS).\nHypersensitivity \n(including \nangioedema and \nanaphylaxis)\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders\n\nAnorexia Weight decreased, \nweight increase\n\nHyponatraemia\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nDepression, \nhostility/aggression, \nanxiety, insomnia, \nnervousness/irritability\n\nSuicide attempt, \nsuicidal ideation, \npsychotic disorder, \nabnormal \nbehaviour, \nhallucination, \nanger, confusional \nstate, panic attack, \naffect \nlability/mood \nswings, agitation\n\nCompleted \nsuicide, \npersonality \ndisorder, \nthinking \nabnormal, \ndelirium\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nSomnolence, \nheadache\n\nConvulsion, balance \ndisorder, dizziness, \nlethargy, tremor\n\nAmnesia, memory \nimpairment, \ncoordination \nabnormal/ataxia, \nparaesthesia, \ndisturbance in \nattention\n\nChoreoathetosis, \ndyskinesia, \nhyperkinesia, \ngait disturbance, \nencephalopathy\n\nEye disorders Diplopia, vision \nblurred\n\nEar and labyrinth\ndisorders\n\nVertigo\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nCough\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nAbdominal pain, \ndiarrhoea, dyspepsia, \nvomiting, nausea\n\nPancreatitis\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nLiver function test \nabnormal\n\nHepatic failure, \nhepatitis\n\n\n\n11\n\nMedDRA SOC\nFrequency category\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash Alopecia, eczema, \npruritus\n\nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, \nerythema \nmultiforme\n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders\n\nMuscle weakness, \nmyalgia\n\nRhabdomyolysis\nand blood \ncreatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased*\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\nAcute kidney \ninjury\n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nAsthenia/fatigue\n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications\n\nInjury\n\n* Prevalence is significantly higher in Japanese patients when compared to non-Japanese patients.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nThe risk of anorexia is higher when levetiracetam is co-administered with topiramate. \n\nIn several cases of alopecia, recovery was observed when levetiracetam was discontinued.\n\nBone marrow suppression was identified in some of the cases of pancytopenia.\n\nCases of encephalopathy generally occurred at the beginning of the treatment (few days to a few months) \nand were reversible after treatment discontinuation.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn patients aged 1 month to less than 4 years, a total of 190 patients have been treated with levetiracetam \nin placebo-controlled and open label extension studies. Sixty of these patients were treated with \nlevetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies. In patients aged 4-16 years, a total of 645 patients have been \ntreated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies. 233 of these patients \nwere treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies. In both these paediatric age ranges, these \ndata are supplemented with the post-marketing experience of the use of levetiracetam.\n\nIn addition, 101 infants aged less than 12 months have been exposed in a post authorization safety study.\nNo new safety concerns for levetiracetam were identified for infants less than 12 months of age with \nepilepsy. \n\nThe adverse reaction profile of levetiracetam is generally similar across age groups and across the \napproved epilepsy indications. Safety results in paediatric patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies \nwere consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults except for behavioural and psychiatric \nadverse reactions which were more common in children than in adults. In children and adolescents aged \n\n\n\n12\n\n4 to 16 years, vomiting (very common, 11.2%), agitation (common, 3.4%), mood swings (common, \n2.1%), affect lability (common, 1.7%), aggression (common, 8.2%), abnormal behaviour (common, \n5.6%), and lethargy (common, 3.9%) were reported more frequently than in other age ranges or in the \noverall safety profile. In infants and children aged 1 month to less than 4 years, irritability (very common, \n11.7%) and coordination abnormal (common, 3.3%) were reported more frequently than in other age \ngroups or in the overall safety profile.\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled paediatric safety study with a non-inferiority design has assessed the \ncognitive and neuropsychological effects of levetiracetam in children 4 to 16 years of age with partial \nonset seizures. It was concluded that levetiracetam was not different (non-inferior) from placebo with \nregard to the change from baseline of the Leiter-R Attention and Memory, Memory Screen Composite \nscore in the per-protocol population. Results related to behavioural and emotional functioning indicated a \nworsening in levetiracetam treated patients on aggressive behaviour as measured in a standardised and \nsystematic way using a validated instrument (CBCL – Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist). However \nsubjects, who took levetiracetam in the long-term open label follow-up study, did not experience a\nworsening, on average, in their behavioural and emotional functioning; in particular measures of\naggressive behaviour were not worse than baseline.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nSomnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma \nwere observed with levetiracetam overdoses.\n\nManagement of overdose\n\nThere is no specific antidote for levetiracetam. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may\ninclude haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60% for levetiracetam and 74% for the\nprimary metabolite.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX14.\n\nThe active substance, levetiracetam, is a pyrrolidone derivative (S-enantiomer of \nα-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide), chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic active substances.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe mechanism of action of levetiracetam still remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro and in vivo\nexperiments suggest that levetiracetam does not alter basic cell characteristics and normal\nneurotransmission.\n\n\n\n13\n\nIn vitro studies show that levetiracetam affects intraneuronal Ca2+ levels by partial inhibition of N-type\nCa2+ currents and by reducing the release of Ca2+ from intraneuronal stores. In addition, it partially\nreverses the reductions in GABA- and glycine-gated currents induced by zinc and β-carbolines.\nFurthermore, levetiracetam has been shown in in vitro studies to bind to a specific site in rodent brain\ntissue. This binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, believed to be involved in vesicle fusion and \nneurotransmitter exocytosis. Levetiracetam and related analogues show a rank order of affinity for binding \nto the synaptic vesicle protein 2A which correlates with the potency of their anti-seizure protection in the \nmouse audiogenic model of epilepsy. This finding suggests that the interaction between levetiracetam and \nthe synaptic vesicle protein 2A seems to contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the \nmedicinal product.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nLevetiracetam induces seizure protection in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary\ngeneralised seizures without having a pro-convulsant effect. The primary metabolite is inactive.\nIn man, an activity in both partial and generalised epilepsy conditions (epileptiform\ndischarge/photoparoxysmal response) has confirmed the broad spectrum pharmacological profile of\nlevetiracetam.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nAdjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in \nadults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy.\nIn adults, levetiracetam efficacy has been demonstrated in 3 double-blind, placebo--controlled studies at \n1,000 mg, 2,000 mg, or 3,000 mg/day, given in 2 divided doses, with a treatment duration of up to\n18 weeks. In a pooled analysis, the percentage of patients who achieved 50% or greater reduction from \nbaseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week at stable dose (12/14 weeks) was of 27.7%, 31.6% \nand 41.3% for patients on 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 mg levetiracetam respectively and of 12.6% for patients \non placebo.\n\nPaediatric population\nIn paediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age), levetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled study, which included 198 patients and had a treatment duration of 14 weeks. In this \nstudy, the patients received levetiracetam as a fixed dose of 60 mg/kg/day (with twice a day dosing).\n\n44.6% of the levetiracetam treated patients and 19.6% of the patients on placebo had a 50% or greater \nreduction from baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week. With continued long-term\ntreatment, 11.4% of the patients were seizure-free for at least 6 months and 7.2% were seizure-free for at \nleast 1 year.\n\n35 infants aged less than 1 year with partial onset seizures have been exposed in placebo-control clinical \nstudies of which only 13 were aged < 6 months.\n\nMonotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in\npatients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.\nEfficacy of levetiracetam as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, noninferiority\ncomparison to carbamazepine controlled release (CR) in 576 patients 16 years of age or older with newly \nor recently diagnosed epilepsy. The patients had to present with unprovoked partial seizures or with \ngeneralized tonic-clonic seizures only. The patients were randomized to carbamazepine CR \n400-1,200 mg/day or levetiracetam 1,000-3,000 mg/day, the duration of the treatment was up to \n121 weeks depending on the response.\n\n\n\n14\n\nSix-month seizure freedom was achieved in 73.0% of levetiracetam-treated patients and 72.8% of\ncarbamazepine-CR treated patients; the adjusted absolute difference between treatments was 0.2% (95% \nCI:-7.8 8.2). More than half of the subjects remained seizure free for 12 months (56.6% and 58.5% of \nsubjects on levetiracetam and on carbamazepine CR respectively).\n\nIn a study reflecting clinical practice, the concomitant antiepileptic medication could be withdrawn in a \nlimited number of patients who responded to levetiracetam adjunctive therapy (36 adult patients out of \n69).\n\nAdjunctive therapy in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age \nwith Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.\nLevetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 16 weeks duration, \nin patients 12 years of age and older suffering from idiopathic generalized epilepsy with myoclonic \nseizures in different syndromes. The majority of patients presented with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. In \nthis study, levetiracetam, dose was 3,000 mg/day given in 2 divided doses. 58.3% of the levetiracetam \ntreated patients and 23.3% of the patients on placebo had at least a 50% reduction in myoclonic seizure \ndays per week. With continued long-term treatment, 28.6% of the patients were free of myoclonic seizures \nfor at least 6 months and 21.0% were free of myoclonic seizures for at least 1 year.\n\nAdjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents \nfrom 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.\nLevetiracetam efficacy was established in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study which\nincluded adults, adolescents and a limited number of children suffering from idiopathic generalized\nepilepsy with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in different syndromes (juvenile\nmyoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal \nseizures on awakening). In this study, levetiracetam dose was 3,000 mg/day for adults and adolescents or \n60 mg/kg/day for children, given in 2 divided doses.\n\n72.2% of the levetiracetam treated patients and 45.2% of the patients on placebo had a 50% or greater \ndecrease in the frequency of PGTC seizures per week. With continued long-term treatment, 47.4% of the \npatients were free of tonic-clonic seizures for at least 6 months and 31.5% were free of tonic-clonic \nseizures for at least 1 year.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile has been characterized following oral administration. A single dose of\n1,500 mg levetiracetam diluted in 100 ml of a compatible diluent and infused intravenously over\n15 minutes is bioequivalent to 1,500 mg levetiracetam oral intake, given as three 500 mg tablets.\n\nThe intravenous administration of doses up to 4,000 mg diluted in 100 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride\ninfused over 15 minutes and doses up to 2,500 mg diluted in 100 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride infused over \n5 minutes was evaluated. The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles did not identify any safety concerns.\n\nLevetiracetam is a highly soluble and permeable compound. The pharmacokinetic profile is linear with\nlow intra- and inter-subject variability. There is no modification of the clearance after repeated\nadministration. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was also confirmed\nfollowing 1,500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with twice daily dosing.\n\nThere is no evidence for any relevant gender, race or circadian variability. The pharmacokinetic profile is \ncomparable in healthy volunteers and in patients with epilepsy.\n\n\n\n15\n\nAdults and adolescents\n\nDistribution\n\nPeak plasma concentration (Cmax) observed in 17 subjects following a single intravenous dose of 1,500 mg \ninfused over 15 minutes was 51 ± 19 micrograms/ml (arithmetic average ± standard deviation).\n\nNo tissue distribution data are available in humans.\n\nNeither levetiracetam nor its primary metabolite are significantly bound to plasma proteins (< 10 %).\nThe volume of distribution of levetiracetam is approximately 0.5 to 0.7 l/kg, a value close to the total body \nwater volume.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nLevetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans. The major metabolic pathway (24% of the dose) \nis an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. Production of the primary metabolite, ucb L057, is not \nsupported by liver cytochrome P450 isoforms. Hydrolysis of the acetamide group was measurable in a large \nnumber of tissues including blood cells. The metabolite ucb L057 is pharmacologically inactive.\n\nTwo minor metabolites were also identified. One was obtained by hydroxylation of the pyrrolidone ring \n(1.6 % of the dose) and the other one by opening of the pyrrolidone ring (0.9% of the dose). Other \nunidentified components accounted only for 0.6% of the dose.\n\nNo enantiomeric interconversion was evidenced in vivo for either levetiracetam or its primary metabolite.\n\nIn vitro, levetiracetam and its primary metabolite have been shown not to inhibit the major human liver \ncytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 1A2), glucuronyl transferase \n(UGT1A1 and UGT1A6) and epoxide hydroxylase activities. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the \nin vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid.\n\nIn human hepatocytes in culture, levetiracetam had little or no effect on CYP1A2, SULT1E1 or UGT1A1. \nLevetiracetam caused mild induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The in vitro data and in vivo interaction \ndata on oral contraceptives, digoxin and warfarin indicate that no significant enzyme induction is expected \nin vivo. Therefore, the interaction of levetiracetam with other substances, or vice versa, is unlikely.\n\nElimination\n\nThe plasma half-life in adults was 7±1 hours and did not vary either with dose, route of administration or \nrepeated administration. The mean total body clearance was 0.96 ml/min/kg.\n\nThe major route of excretion was via urine, accounting for a mean 95% of the dose (approximately 93% of \nthe dose was excreted within 48 hours). Excretion via faeces accounted for only 0.3% of the dose. The \ncumulative urinary excretion of levetiracetam and its primary metabolite accounted for 66% and 24% of \nthe dose, respectively during the first 48 hours.\n\nThe renal clearance of levetiracetam and ucb L057 is 0.6 and 4.2 ml/min/kg respectively indicating that \nlevetiracetam is excreted by glomerular filtration with subsequent tubular reabsorption and that the \nprimary metabolite is also excreted by active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration.\nLevetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance.\n\n\n\n16\n\nElderly people\n\nIn the elderly, the half-life is increased by about 40% (10 to 11 hours). This is related to the decrease in \nrenal function in this population (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe apparent body clearance of both levetiracetam and of its primary metabolite is correlated to the\ncreatinine clearance. It is therefore recommended to adjust the maintenance daily dose of levetiracetam,\nbased on creatinine clearance in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nIn anuric end-stage renal disease adult subjects the half-life was approximately 25 and 3.1 hours during \ninterdialytic and intradialytic periods, respectively.\n\nThe fractional removal of levetiracetam was 51% during a typical 4-hour dialysis session.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nIn subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, there was no relevant modification of the\nclearance of levetiracetam. In most subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the clearance of\nlevetiracetam was reduced by more than 50% due to a concomitant renal impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nChildren (4 to 12 years)\nThe pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients has not been investigated after intravenous administration.\nHowever, based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of levetiracetam, the pharmacokinetics in adults \nafter intravenous administration and the pharmacokinetics in children after oral administration, the \nexposure (AUC) of levetiracetam is expected to be similar in paediatric patients aged 4 to 12 years after \nintravenous and oral administration.\n\nFollowing single oral dose administration (20 mg/kg) to epileptic children (6 to 12 years), the half-life of \nlevetiracetam was 6.0 hours. The apparent body weight adjusted clearance was approximately 30% higher \nthan in epileptic adults.\n\nFollowing repeated oral dose administration (20 to 60 mg/kg/day) to epileptic children (4 to 12 years),\nlevetiracetam was rapidly absorbed. Peak plasma concentration was observed 0.5 to 1.0 hour after dosing. \nLinear and dose proportional increases were observed for peak plasma concentrations and area under the \ncurve. The elimination half-life was approximately 5 hours. The apparent body clearance was \n1.1 ml/min/kg.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety\npharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.\n\nAdverse effects not observed in clinical studies but seen in the rat and to a lesser extent in the mouse at\nexposure levels similar to human exposure levels and with possible relevance for clinical use were liver \nchanges, indicating an adaptive response such as increased weight and centrilobular hypertrophy, fatty \ninfiltration and increased liver enzymes in plasma.\n\nNo adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction performance were observed in rats at\ndoses up to 1,800 mg/kg/day (x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 or exposure basis) in parents and F1 generation.\n\n\n\n17\n\nTwo embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies were performed in rats at 400, 1200 and 3600 mg/kg/day. \nAt 3,600 mg/kg/day, in only one of the 2 EFD studies, there was a slight decrease in foetal weight \nassociated with a marginal increase in skeletal variations/minor anomalies. There was no effect on \nembryomortality and no increased incidence of malformations. The NOAEL (No Observed Adverse \nEffect Level) was 3600 mg/kg/day for pregnant female rats (x 12 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and \n1200 mg/kg/day for foetuses.\n\nFour embryo-foetal development studies were performed in rabbits covering doses of 200, 600, 800, 1,200 \nand 1,800 mg/kg/day. The dose level of 1800 mg/kg/day induced a marked maternal toxicity and a \ndecrease in foetal weight associated with increased incidence of foetuses with cardiovascular/skeletal\nanomalies. The NOAEL was <200 mg/kg/day for the dams and 200 mg/kg/day for the foetuses (equal to \nthe MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).\n\nA peri- and post-natal development study was performed in rats with levetiracetam doses of 70, 350 and \n1,800 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was ≥ 1800 mg/kg/day for the F0 females, and for the survival, growth and \ndevelopment of the F1 offspring up to weaning (x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).\n\nNeonatal and juvenile animal studies in rats and dogs demonstrated that there were no adverse effects seen \nin any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints at doses up to 1,800 mg/kg/day (x 6-17 the \nMRHD on a mg/m2 basis)\n\n6.

What Levetiracetam Hospira is and what it is used for\n\nLevetiracetam is an antiepileptic medicine (a medicine used to treat seizures (fits) in epilepsy).\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira is used:\n on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to treat\n\na certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits (seizures). \nLevetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only one side of the \nbrain, but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (partial onset seizure \nwith or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given to you by your doctor to \nreduce the number of fits.\n\n as an add-on to other antiepileptic medicines to treat:\n partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from \n\n4 years of age\n myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in adults and \n\nadolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in \n\nadults and adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type of \nepilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause).\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira concentrate for solution for infusion is an alternative for patients when \nadministration of the antiepileptic levetiracetam medicine by mouth is temporarily not feasible.\n\n\n\n31\n\n2.

He/she may decide if your \n\ndose should be adjusted.\n If you notice any slow down in the growth or unexpected puberty development of your child, \n\nplease contact your doctor.\n A small number of people being treated with antiepileptics such as Levetiracetam Hospira have \n\nhad thoughts of harming or killing themselves. If you have any symptoms of depression and/or \nsuicidal ideation, please contact your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the following side effects gets serious or last longer than a few \ndays:\n Abnormal thoughts, feeling irritable or reacting more aggressively than usually, or if you or your \n\nfamily and friends notice important changes in mood or behaviour.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n Levetiracetam Hospira is not indicated in children and adolescents below 16 years on it’s own \n\n(monotherapy)\n\nOther medicines and Levetiracetam Hospira\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nDo not take macrogol (a drug used as laxative) for one hour before and one hour after taking levetiracetam \nas this may results in a reduction of its effect. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice before taking this medicine. Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, only if after \ncareful assessment it is considered necessary by your doctor.

Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira may impair your ability to drive or operate any tools or machinery, as it may make \nyou feel sleepy. This is more likely at the beginning of treatment or after an increase in the dose. You \nshould not drive or use machines until it is established that your ability to perform such activities is not \naffected.\n\n\n\n32\n\nLevetiracetam Hospira contains sodium\n\nOne maximum single dose of Levetiracetam Hospira concentrate contains 2.5 mmol (or 57 mg) of sodium \n(0.8 mmol (or 19 mg) of sodium per vial). This should be taken into consideration if you are on a \ncontrolled sodium diet.\n\n3.

Your total daily dose and frequency of administration remain identical.\n\nMonotherapy\nDose in adults and adolescents (from 16 years of age):\nGeneral dose: between 1,000 mg and 3,000 mg each day.\nWhen you first start taking Levetiracetam Hospira, your doctor will prescribe you a lower dose for \n2 weeks before giving you the lowest general dose.\n\nAdd-on therapy\nDose in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more:\nGeneral dose: between 1,000 mg and 3,000 mg each day.\n\nDose in children (4 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing less than 50 kg:\nGeneral dose: between 20 mg per kg bodyweight and 60 mg per kg bodyweight each day.\n\nMethod and route of administration:\nLevetiracetam Hospira is for intravenous use.\nThe recommended dose must be diluted in at least 100 ml of a compatible diluent and infused over \n15-minutes.\n\nFor doctors and nurses, more detailed direction for the proper use of Levetiracetam Hospira is provided in \nsection 6.\n\nDuration of treatment:\n There is no experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for a longer period than \n\n4 days.\n\nIf you stop using Levetiracetam Hospira:\nIf stopping treatment, as with other antiepileptic medicines, Levetiracetam Hospira should be discontinued \ngradually to avoid an increase of seizures.
