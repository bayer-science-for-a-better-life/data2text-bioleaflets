NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCyltezo 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe\nCyltezo 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nCyltezo 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe\nEach 0.8 mL single dose pre-filled syringe contains 40 mg of adalimumab. \n\nCyltezo 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen\nEach 0.8 mL single dose pre-filled pen contains 40 mg of adalimumab. \n\nAdalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\n\nClear to slightly opalescent solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\nCyltezo in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n\n the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. \n\n the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with \nmethotrexate. \n\nCyltezo can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment \nwith methotrexate is inappropriate. \n\nCyltezo reduces the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and improves physical \nfunction, when given in combination with methotrexate.\n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis\n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\nAdalimumab in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or more \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Adalimumab can be given as monotherapy in case of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nintolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the efficacy \nin monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years.\n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis\n\nAdalimumab is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section \n5.1).\n\nAxial spondyloarthritis\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS)\n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an \ninadequate response to conventional therapy.\n\nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, who have had an \ninadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response \nto previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Adalimumab has been \nshown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with \npolyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see Section 5.1) and to improve physical function.\n\nPsoriasis\n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy.\n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis\n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from 4 \nyears of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy and \nphototherapies.\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS)\n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) in \nadults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS \ntherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nCrohn’s disease\n\nCyltezo is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who \nhave not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.\n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease\n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric patients \n(from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including primary \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nnutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or have \ncontraindications for such therapies.\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nCyltezo is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who \nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine \n(6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.\n\nUveitis\n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult\npatients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid-sparing,\nor in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate.\n\nPaediatric Uveitis\n\nCyltezo is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from\n2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in whom \nconventional therapy is inappropriate.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nCyltezo treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of conditions for which Cyltezo is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with an \nappropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Cyltezo (see section 4.4). Patients treated with \nCyltezo should be given the patient alert card.\n\nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Cyltezo if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.\n\nDuring treatment with Cyltezo, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory \nagents) should be optimised.\n\nPosology\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nThe recommended dose of Cyltezo for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be continued \nduring treatment with Cyltezo.\n\nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued during \ntreatment with Cyltezo. Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than \nmethotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1.\n\nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Cyltezo 40 mg every other\nweek may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other week.\n\nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued \ntherapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.\n\nDose interruption\n\nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nAvailable data suggest that re-introduction of adalimumab after discontinuation for 70 days or longer resulted \nin the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose interruption.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic arthritis \n\nThe recommended dose of Cyltezo for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every \nother week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n\nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued \ntherapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.\n\nPsoriasis\n\nThe recommended dose of Cyltezo for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered subcutaneously, \nfollowed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. \n\nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n\nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Cyltezo 40 mg every other week may benefit from an \nincrease in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and risks of continued \n40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with an \ninadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate response is achieved with \n40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently be reduced to 40 mg every other \nweek.\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa\n\nThe recommended Cyltezo dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is 160 mg\ninitially at Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). \nTwo weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week (given as \ntwo 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during treatment with Cyltezo if necessary. \nIt is recommended that the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis \nduring treatment with Cyltezo.\n\nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period.\n\nShould treatment be interrupted, Cyltezo 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be re-introduced \n(see section 5.1).\n\nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see section 5.1).\n\nCrohn’s disease\n\nThe recommended Cyltezo induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a more rapid \nresponse to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two \n40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in one \nday), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction.\n\nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \nAlternatively, if a patient has stopped Cyltezo and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Cyltezo may be re-\nadministered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the previous \ndose.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. \n\nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Cyltezo 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Cyltezo every week or 80 mg every other week.\n\nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy through \nweek 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time \nperiod.\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nThe recommended Cyltezo induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative \ncolitis is 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for \ntwo consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). After induction \ntreatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n\nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. \n\nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Cyltezo 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Cyltezo every week or 80 mg every other week.\n\nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. Cyltezo\ntherapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n\nUveitis\n\nThe recommended dose of Cyltezo for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited experience in the \ninitiation of treatment with adalimumab alone. Treatment with Cyltezo can be initiated in combination with \ncorticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents. Concomitant corticosteroids may \nbe tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two weeks after initiating treatment with Cyltezo.\n\nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a yearly \nbasis (see section 5.1).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment\n\nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nCyltezo is only available as 40 mg pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen. Thus, it is not possible to administer \nCyltezo to paediatric patients that require less than a full 40 mg dose. If an alternate dose is required, other \nadalimumab products offering such an option should be used.Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis\n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age:\nThe recommended dose of adalimumab for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from \n2 years of age is based on body weight (Table 1).

Impaired lung function may \nincrease the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, \nincluding tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Cyltezo. Because the elimination of \nadalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n\nTreatment with Cyltezo should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and \npatients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, \ncoccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Cyltezo should be considered \nprior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n\nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Cyltezo should be monitored closely \nand undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Cyltezo should be discontinued if a patient \ndevelops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be \ninitiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of \nCyltezo in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose \npatients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n\nSerious infections\n\nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or other \nopportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. \n\nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. \n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nadalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis. \n\nBefore initiation of therapy with Cyltezo, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (“latent”) \ntuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient history of \ntuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray) should be \nperformed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct and results \nof these tests are recorded in the patient alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative \ntuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n\nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Cyltezo therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n\nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n11\n\nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted. \n\nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis \ntreatment before the initiation of Cyltezo, and in accordance with local recommendations. \n\nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Cyltezo in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and in \npatients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot \nbe confirmed.\n\nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis infection \n(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after therapy with \nCyltezo.\n\nOther opportunistic infections\n\nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists and \nthis has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes. \n\nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Cyltezo should be promptly \ndiscontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in \nconsultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections. \n\nHepatitis B reactivation\n\nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, who \nare chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients \nshould be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Cyltezo. For patients who test positive for \nhepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \nrecommended. \n\nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Cyltezo should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of \nactive HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. Adequate \ndata from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-\nantagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, \nCyltezo should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be \ninitiated. \n\nNeurological events\n\nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating \ndisease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including \nGuillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Cyltezo in patients \nwith pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; \ndiscontinuation of Cyltezo should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known \nassociation between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders.

Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab administration. If an anaphylactic \nreaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Cyltezo should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated.\n\nDry natural rubber / latex sensitivity\n\nThe inner part of the cap of the syringe (the needle cover) contains natural rubber (latex). This may cause \nsevere allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.\n\nImmunosuppression\n\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no evidence \nof depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils.\n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders\n\nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. \nHowever, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in \npatients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia \nin rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates \nthe risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, \nleukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n\nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years \nof age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including adalimumab in the \npost marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety \nof different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression. A risk \nfor the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be \nexcluded. \n\nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Cyltezo should be carefully \nconsidered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Cyltezo\ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n\nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional caution should be \nexercised in considering Cyltezo treatment of these patients (see section 4.8).\n\nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-melanoma \nskin cancer prior to and during treatment with Cyltezo. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have also been \nreported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n13\n\nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung or \nhead and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a \nhistory of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in COPD \npatients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma \n(for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had a \nprior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before \ntherapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per \nlocal recommendations. \n\nHaematologic reactions\n\nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. Adverse \nevents of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. thrombocytopenia, \nleukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical \nattention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, \nbleeding, pallor) while on Cyltezo. Discontinuation of Cyltezo therapy should be considered in patients with \nconfirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n\nVaccinations\n\nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent virus \nvaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with \nadalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in \npatients receiving adalimumab. \n\nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy. \n\nPatients on Cyltezo may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live \nvaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months \nfollowing the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n\nCongestive heart failure\n\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Cyltezo should be used with caution in patients with mild \nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Cyltezo is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Cyltezo must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of \ncongestive heart failure. \n\nAutoimmune processes\n\nTreatment with Cyltezo may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Cyltezo on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Cyltezo and is positive for \nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Cyltezo should not be given (see section \n4.8). \n\nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\n\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-antagonist, \netanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the nature of the adverse \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n14\n\nevents seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from \nthe combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the combination of adalimumab and \nanakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5).\n\nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including \nserious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5). \n\nSurgery\n\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The long half-\nlife of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who \nrequires surgery while on Cyltezo should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should \nbe taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving adalimumab. \n\nSmall bowel obstruction\n\nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture that \nmay require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause strictures. \n\nElderly\n\nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7 %) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5 %). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nSee Vaccinations above.\n\nExcipients with known effects\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 mL dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate. Antibody \nformation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as \nmonotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of \nantibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). \n\nThe combination of Cyltezo and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration of \nbiologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).\n\nThe combination of Cyltezo and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of child bearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Cyltezo treatment.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n15\n\nPregnancy\n\nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab\nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first trimester,\ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn.\n\nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) treated \nwith adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with\nadalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The rate of \npregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7 %) in the \nadalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8 %) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted OR \n1.31, 95 % CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5 %) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 (9.4 %) \nin the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95 % CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR (accounting for \nbaseline differences) was 1.10 (95 % CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were no distinct \ndifferences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints spontaneous \nabortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic infections and no \nstillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological \nlimitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design.\n\nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available (see \nsection 5.3).\n\nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.\n\nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of live \nvaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to Cyltezo in utero is not recommended for 5 months \nfollowing the mother’s last Cyltezo injection during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1 % to 1 % \nof the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and \nhave poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nCyltezo can be used during breastfeeding.\nFertility\n\nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCyltezo may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual impairment \nmay occur following administration of Cyltezo (see section 4.8).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n16\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open-label trials for up to 60 months or \nmore. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as well as axial \nspondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), \npsoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. \nThe pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving \nplacebo or active comparator during the controlled period.\n\nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9 % for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4 % for control treated \npatients.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \nheadache and musculoskeletal pain. \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab affect \nthe immune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer.\n\nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation \nand various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use of \nadalimumab.\n\nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include rare\nreports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of lupus, \nlupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult \npatients. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience. They are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: very common \n(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

adalimumab every other week was consistent with the \nknown safety profile of adalimumab.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nInjection site reactions\n\nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab developed \ninjection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 7.2 % of \npatients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product. \n\nInfections \n\nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the \nadalimumab treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. The \ninfections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most \npatients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved. \n\nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control-treated patients. \n\nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections (including fatal \ninfections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n22\n\nmiliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated or \nextrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis \nand listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after initiation of \ntherapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease.\n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders\n\nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during \nadalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \nenthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease. No \nmalignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during an \nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in \n60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients \nwith uveitis.\n\nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, \nCrohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin \ncancer, were observed at a rate (95 % confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per 1,000 patient-years among \n5,291 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 patient-years among 3,444 \ncontrol patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for adalimumab and 3.8 months for control-\ntreated patients). The rate (95 % confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per \n1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among \ncontrol patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95 % confidence interval) \nof 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 \npatient-years among control patients. The rate (95 % confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) \nper 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among \ncontrol patients.\n\nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension studies \nwith a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 patient-years of \ntherapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient-years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient-years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.3 per \n1,000 patient years. \n\nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment years. \nThe reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 per 1,000 \npatient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nadalimumab (see section 4.4). \n\nAutoantibodies\n\nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nstudies I-V. In these trials, 11.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1 % of placebo and active \ncontrol-treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at \nweek 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nstudies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved \nfollowing discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system \nsymptoms. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23\n\nHepato-biliary events\n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with a \ncontrol period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7 % of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 1.6 % of control-treated patients.\n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who \nwere 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in 6.1 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3 % of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations \noccurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of \nadalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to < 4 years. \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with a \ncontrol period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9 % of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 0.9 % of controlled-treated patients. \n\nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and \nsafety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted induction \ntherapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6 % (5/192) of patients of \nwhom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque Psoriasis with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8 % of adalimumab-treated patients \nand 1.8 % of control-treated patients. \n\nNo ALT elevations ≥ 3 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque \npsoriasis. \n\nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed by \n40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3 % of adalimumab-treated patients \nand 0.6 % of control-treated patients.\n\nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week\nstarting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and\n105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN\noccurred in 2.4 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4 % of control-treated patients.\n\nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such as \nhepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n\nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine\n\nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse events \nwere seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with \nadalimumab alone.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04\n\nCyltezo is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu\n\nMechanism of action\n\nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. \n\nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in \nthe levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with \nan IC50 of 0.1 - 0.2 nM).\n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n\nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \nCrohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with adalimumab. In patients \nwith Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the colon \nincluding a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa \nhave shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab-treated patients. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy and \nsafety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Some \npatients were treated for up to 120 months duration. \n\nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had insufficient \nefficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and \nwhose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n\nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses of 20 or \n40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu\n\n\n25\n\nweeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other disease-\nmodifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n\nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have been \nintolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first received \nplacebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab every week for 52 \nweeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate \nweeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in \nwhich 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n\nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis \nwho were ≥ 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug-naïve \nor to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of \n28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold \nsalts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. \n\nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every other \nweek monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of \nprogression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, \n497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered \nevery other week up to 10 years.\n\nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the percent \nof patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA study V was \nthe percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and V had an additional \nprimary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). RA study \nIII also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n\nACR response \n\nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across \nRA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 7.\n\nTable 7: ACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Percent of Patients)\n\nResponse RA Study Ia** RA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa**\n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc\n\nn = 60 \n\nAdalimumabb\n\n/MTXc\n\nn = 63 \n\nPlacebo \nn = 110 \n\nAdalimumabb\n\nn = 113 \nPlacebo/ \nMTXc\n\nn = 200 \n\nAdalimumabb\n\n/MTXc\n\nn = 207 \nACR 20\n\n6 months\n12 months\n\n13.3 %\nNA\n\n65.1 %\nNA\n\n19.1 %\nNA\n\n46.0 %\nNA\n\n29.5 %\n24.0 %\n\n63.3 %\n58.9 %\n\nACR 50\n6 months\n12 months\n\n6.7 %\nNA\n\n52.4 %\nNA\n\n8.2 %\nNA\n\n22.1 %\nNA\n\n9.5 %\n9.5 %\n\n39.1 %\n41.5 %\n\nACR 70\n6 months\n12 months\n\n3.3 %\nNA\n\n23.8 %\nNA\n\n1.8 %\nNA\n\n12.4 %\nNA\n\n2.5 %\n4.5 %\n\n20.8 %\n23.2 %\n\na RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks, and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks\nb 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n26\n\nc MTX = methotrexate \n** p < 0.01, adalimumab versus placebo\n\nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores and CRP \n(mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo.

Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 170 patients\ncontinued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients (90.6 %) had\nACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients (60.0 %) had ACR 70 \nresponses.\n\nAt week 52, 42.9 % of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6 % of patients receiving methotrexate \nmonotherapy and 23.4 % of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. Adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and adalimumab \nmonotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to \nsevere rheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). \nOf 342 subjects originally randomised to adalimumab monotherapy or adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years of \nadalimumab treatment. Among those, 109 subjects (63.7 %) were reported to be in remission at 10 years.\n\nRadiographic response \n\nIn RA study III, where adalimumab treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. \nAdalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 9). \n\nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with \n40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At 10 years, \n79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated \nradiographically.

The\ncorresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3 %, 23.7 % and 36.7 %,\nrespectively.\n\nQuality of life and physical function \n\nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a pre-\nspecified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of adalimumab in all four studies \nshowed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from baseline to \nMonth 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at week 52. Results from the Short \nForm Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of adalimumab in all four studies support these findings, \nwith statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant \npain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in \nfatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three \nstudies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n\nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment \nmaintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in quality of \nlife was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that time. \n\nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104.

In the open-label lead in phase \n(OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-treated. Patients \nwho were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been withdrawn from MTX at least two weeks \nprior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone \n(≤ 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m² up to a \nmaximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks.

Taking these results into \nconsideration, Cyltezo is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as monotherapy in \npatients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n\npJIA II \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 - < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular \nJIA. The patients received 24 mg/m² body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of 20 mg\nevery other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most subjects used \nconcomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. \n\nAt week 12 and week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5 % and 90.0 %, respectively, using the observed data \napproach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at week 12 and week 24 were \n90.3 %/61.3 %/38.7 % and 83.3 %/73.3 %/36.7 %, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Pediatric \nACR 30) at week 24 (n = 27 out of 30 patients), the Pediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up to \n60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this time period. Overall, 20 \nsubjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in 46 \npaediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were randomised to \nreceive either 24 mg/m² body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \nevery other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period during \nwhich patients received 24 mg/m² BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week \nsubcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from \nBaseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with \nloss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6 %\n(median percent change -88.9 %) in patients in the adalimumab group compared to -11.6 % (median percent \nchange -50.0 %) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was \nmaintained during the OL period through week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group \nwho remained in the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated \nclinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), \nswollen joint count (SJC), Pediatric ACR 50 response, and Pediatric ACR 70 response. \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline score of disease \nactivity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in all groups) who have \nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1 %) patients were treated \nconcomitantly with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4 %) patients with glucocorticoids. \nThe blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which patients received adalimumab 40 mg\nevery other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Subjects (n = 215, 54.7 %) who failed to \nachieve ASAS 20 at weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received early escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other \nweek subcutaneously and were subsequently treated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical \nanalyses. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n31\n\nIn the larger AS study I with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the signs \nand symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with adalimumab compared to placebo. \nSignificant response was first observed at week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks (Table 13).\n\nTable 13: Efficacy Responses in Placebo-Controlled AS Study – Study I Reduction of Signs and \nSymptoms\n\nResponse Placebo\nN = 107\n\nAdalimumab\nN = 208\n\nASASa 20\nWeek 2 16 % 42 %***\nWeek 12 21 % 58 %***\nWeek 24 19 % 51 %***\n\nASAS 50\nWeek 2 3 % 16 %***\nWeek 12 10 % 38 %***\nWeek 24 11 % 35 %***\n\nASAS 70\nWeek 2 0 % 7 %**\nWeek 12 5 % 23 %***\nWeek 24 8 % 24 %***\n\nBASDAIb 50\n\nWeek 2 4 % 20 %***\nWeek 12 16 % 45 %***\nWeek 24 15 % 42 %***\n\n***, ** Statistically significant at p < 0.001, < 0.01 for all comparisons between adalimumab and placebo at \nWeeks 2, 12 and 24 \n\na Assessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis \nb Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index\n\nAdalimumab treated patients had significantly greater improvement at week 12 which was maintained \nthrough week 24 in both the SF36 and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL). \n\nSimilar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled AS study II of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in two randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled\nstudies in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA).

Upon completion of both studies, 383 patients \nenrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. \n\nThere is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of adalimumab in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like \npsoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied.\n\nTable 16: ACR Response in Placebo-Controlled Psoriatic Arthritis Studies (Percent of Patients)\n\nPsA Study I PsA Study II\n\nResponse\nPlacebo\nN = 162\n\nAdalimumab\nN = 151\n\nPlacebo\nN = 49\n\nAdalimumab\nN = 51\n\nACR 20\nWeek 12\nWeek 24\n\nACR 50\nWeek 12\nWeek 24\n\nACR 70\nWeek 12\nWeek 24\n\n14 %\n15 %\n\n4 %\n6 %\n\n1 %\n1 %\n\n58 %***\n57 %***\n\n36 %***\n39 %***\n\n20 %***\n23 %***\n\n16 %\nN/A\n\n2 %\nN/A\n\n0 %\nN/A\n\n39 %*\nN/A\n\n25 %***\nN/A\n\n14 %*\nN/A\n\n*** p < 0.001 for all comparisons between adalimumab and placebo \n* p < 0.05 for all comparisons between adalimumab and placebo \nN/A not applicable \n\nACR responses in PsA study I were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy.

Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet \nwere obtained at baseline and week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on adalimumab or \nplacebo and at week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score \n(mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid \narthritis), was used. \n\nAdalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo \ntreatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean ± SD) 0.8 ± 2.5 in the placebo group (at \nweek 24) compared with 0.0 ± 1.9 (p < 0.001) in the adalimumab group (at week 48). \n\nIn subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to week 48 (n = 102), \n84 % continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. Adalimumab treated \npatients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ and \nShort Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at week 24. Improved physical function continued \nduring the open label extension up to week 136. \n\nPsoriasis \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (≥ 10 %\nBSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12 or ≥ 10) who were candidates for \nsystemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73 % of patients enrolled in Psoriasis \nStudies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy.

In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one \nweek after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 response \n(PASI score improvement of at least 75 % relative to baseline), entered period B and received open-label \n40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained ≥ PASI 75 response at week 33 and were \noriginally randomised to active therapy in period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg\nadalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean \nbaseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from \n“moderate” (53 % of subjects included) to “severe” (41 %) to “very severe” (6 %). \n\nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus methotrexate and \nplacebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose \nincreases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data \navailable comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who \nachieved a ≥ PASI 50 response at week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all \ntreatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “mild” \n(< 1 %) to “moderate” (48 %) to “severe” (46 %) to “very severe” (6 %). \n\nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-label \nextension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n\nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at week 16 (see Tables 17 and 18).\n\nTable 17: Ps Study I (REVEAL) - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks\n\nPlacebo \nN = 398\nn (%)\n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow\nN = 814\nn (%)\n\n≥PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b\n\nPASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b\n\nPGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b\na Percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-adjusted rate \nb p < 0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo\n\nTable 18: Ps Study II (CHAMPION) - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks\n\nPlacebo\nN = 53\nn (%)\n\nMTX\nN = 110\nn (%)\n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow\nN = 108\nn (%)\n\n≥PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6)a, b\n\nPASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7)c, d\n\nPGA: Clear/minimal 6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1)a, b\n\na p < 0.001 adalimumab vs. placebo\nb p < 0.001 adalimumab vs. methotrexate\nc p < 0.01 adalimumab vs. placebo\nd p < 0.05 adalimumab vs. methotrexate\n\nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28 % of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo at \nweek 33 compared to 5 % continuing on adalimumab, p < 0.001, experienced “loss of adequate response” \n(PASI score after week 33 and on or before week 52 that resulted in a < PASI 50 response relative to \nbaseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to week 33).

PASI 75 and PGA of \nclear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7 % and 59.0 %, respectively, after an additional \n108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of \nthe study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered non-responders, \nPASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6 % and 55.7 %, respectively, \nafter an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). \n\nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label \nextension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median time \nto relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients \nexperienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5 % (218/285) of patients who entered the \nretreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective of \nwhether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1 % [123/178] and 88.8 % [95/107] for patients who relapsed \nand who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed \nduring retreatment as before withdrawal. \n\nSignificant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX (Study \nII) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, improvements in the \nphysical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to placebo. \n\nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg\nweekly due to a PASI response below 50 %, 26.4 % (92/349) and 37.8 % (132/349) of patients achieved \nPASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively.\n\nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 72 patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients received an initial \ndose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or \nplacebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who received \nadalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to patients who \nreceived placebo (30.6 % versus 4.3 %, respectively [p = 0.014]). \n\nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients with \nmoderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg \nevery other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label \nadalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the Modified Nail \nPsoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and \nthe Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 19). Adalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in \nnail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin involvement (BSA ≥ 10% (60 % of patients) and \nBSA < 10 % and ≥ 5 % (40 % of patients)).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n37\n\nTable 19: Ps Study IV Efficacy Results at 16, 26 and 52 Weeks\n\nEndpoint Week 16\nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 26\nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 52\nOpen-label\n\nPlacebo\nN = 108\n\nAdalimumab\n40 mg eow\n\nN = 109\n\nPlacebo\nN = 108\n\nAdalimumab\n40 mg eow\n\nN = 109\n\nAdalimumab\n40 mg eow\n\nN = 80\n≥ mNAPSI 75 \n(%)\n\n2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0\n\nPGA-F \nclear/minimal \nand ≥ 2-grade \nimprovement \n(%)\n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3\n\nPercent Change \nin Total\nFingernail \nNAPSI (%)\n\n-7.8 -44.2a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2\n\na p < 0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo\n\nAdalimumab treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at week 26 compared with\nplacebo in the DLQI.\n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n\nThe efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 paediatric \npatients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a PGA ≥ 4 or > 20 % BSA \ninvolvement or > 10 % BSA involvement with very thick lesions or PASI ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically \nrelevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical therapy \nand heliotherapy or phototherapy.\n\nPatients received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or methotrexate \n0.1-0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg).

The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III disease with at least 3 \nabscesses or inflammatory nodules.\n\nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every week \nstarting at week 4 to week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the study. After 12 weeks \nof therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were re-randomised in Period B to 1 of 3 \ntreatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from \nweek 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were assigned to receive \nadalimumab 40 mg every week in Period B.\n\nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg every week \nstarting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3 % of patients had continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were re-randomised in \nPeriod B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, \nor placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were \nassigned to receive placebo in Period B.\n\nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension study in \nwhich adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab population was \n762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily.\n\nClinical Response\n\nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50 % reduction in total abscess \nand inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count \nrelative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in \npatients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale.\n\nAt week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo achieved \nHiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced a clinically \nrelevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 21).

Safety of the recommended \nadalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on cross-indication safety profile of adalimumab \nin both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more frequent doses (see section 5.2).\n\nCrohn’s disease \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, \nand/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80 % of patients continued to receive at least one of \nthese medications. \n\nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised \nto one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week\n2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2. In CD Study II, 325 \npatients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg\nadalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2. The primary non-responders were \nexcluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n\nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD Study III, 854 patients \nreceived open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg\nevery other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks. Patients in clinical \nresponse (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in clinical \nresponse at week 4.

Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n\nQuality of life \n\nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to \nadalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CD Study III \nas well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n\nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \n\nAdalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body weight (< 40 kg or\n≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, with moderate to severe \nCrohn´s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30. Subjects \nhad to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator) for CD. \nSubjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to infliximab. \n\nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: 160 mg at \nweek 0 and 80 mg at week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for subjects < 40 kg. \n\nAt week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low Dose or \nStandard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 25.\n\nTable 25: Maintenance regimen\n\nPatient weight Low dose Standard dose\n\n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow\n\n≥ 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n42\n\nEfficacy results \n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at week 26, defined as PCDAI score ≤ 10.\n\nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points from \nBaseline) rates are presented in Table 26.

The number of \nall cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs. 0.26 per patient \nyear in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related hospitalisations were 0.12 per patient \nyear vs. 0.22 per patient year. \n\nQuality of life \n\nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease \nQuestionnaire (IBDQ) score. \n\nUveitis\n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate,\nposterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, \ndouble-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an \ninitial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose.\nConcomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.\n\nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral prednisone \nat a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at \nstudy entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by \nweek 15.\n\nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment (oral \nprednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a \nmandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ´time to treatment failure´. Treatment failure was defined \nby a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular \nlesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).\n\nClinical response\n\nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in \npatients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (see Table 29). Both studies\ndemonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus placebo (see\nFigure 2).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n45\n\nTable 29: Time to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II\n\nAnalysis\nTreatment\n\nN Failure\nN (%)\n\nMedian Time to \nFailure (months)\n\nHRa CI 95 %\nfor HRa\n\np valueb\n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 6 in Study UV I\nPrimary analysis (ITT)\n\nPlacebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- --\nAdalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, 0.70 < 0.001\n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 2 in Study UV II\nPrimary analysis (ITT)\n\nPlacebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- --\nAdalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, 0.84 0.004\n\nNote: Treatment failure at or after week 6 (Study UV I), or at or after week 2 (Study UV II), was counted as \nevent.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences were observed for \nvisual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of adalimumab.\n\nOf the 417 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 46 subjects \nwere regarded ineligible (e.g. developed complications secondary to diabetic retinopathy, due to cataract \nsurgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of efficacy. Of the 371 remaining \npatients, 276 evaluable patients reached 78 weeks of open-label adalimumab treatment. Based on the \nobserved data approach, 222 (80.4 %) were in quiescence (no active inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade  \n≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg per day, and 184 (66.7 %) were in \nsteroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.4 % of the \neyes at week 78. Among the patients who discontinued the study prior to week 78, 11 % discontinued due to \nadverse events, and 5 % due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, using \nthe NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with statistically \nsignificant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and total score in \nStudy UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related effects were not \nnumerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in Study UVI and for colour vision, peripheral vision \nand near vision in Study UV II.\n\nPaediatric uveitis\n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-masked, controlled study of \n90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis\nwho were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either placebo or\n20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in combination with\ntheir baseline dose of methotrexate.\n\nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were\nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development of \nsustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of concomitant \nmedications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n47\n\nClinical response\n\nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 3,\nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated with \nplacebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with\nadalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. Adalimumab\nsignificantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75 % relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard ratio \n(HR = 0.25 [95 % CI: 0.12, 0.49]).\n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric \nUveitis Study\n\nNote: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = ADALIMUMAB (Number at Risk).\n\nImmunogenicity \n\nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of anti-adalimumab \nantibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. There is no apparent \ncorrelation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the occurrence of adverse events. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nadalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in ulcerative colitis, see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n48\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and distribution\n\nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was \nslow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average absolute \nbioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was \n64 %. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, concentrations were dose proportional. \nAfter doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to 15 mL/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) \nranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab \nconcentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96 % of those \nin serum. \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 μg/mL (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 μg/mL (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. The serum \nadalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and \n80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n\nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m² (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough steady-\nstate (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 ± 5.6 μg/mL (102 %\nCV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 μg/mL (47.7 % CV) with \nconcomitant methotrexate. \n\nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg dosed \nwith adalimumab 24 mg/m² , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations was \n6.0 ± 6.1 μg/mL (101 % CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 ± 5.6 μg/mL\n(71.2 % CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n\nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m² (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state (values \nmeasured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/mL for adalimumab without \nconcomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/mL with concomitant methotrexate.\n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-radiographic\naxial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state concentration at week 68 was \n8.0 ± 4.6 μg/mL.\n\nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 μg/mL during adalimumab \n40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n\nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npaediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab trough \nconcentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 μg/mL (79 % CV). \n\nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg\non week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 µg/mL at week 2 and \nweek 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were approximately 8 to \n10 µg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.\n\nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic modelling \nand simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients (paediatric psoriasis, \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related arthritis). The recommended \nadolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week.

A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg\nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 μg/mL\nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 μg/mL were observed in \nCrohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n\nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was 160/80 mg\nor 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. At week 4, patients \nwere randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose (20/10 mg eow) maintenance \ntreatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (± SD) serum adalimumab trough concentrations \nachieved at week 4 were 15.7±6.6 μg/mL for patients ≥ 40 kg (160/80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 μg/mL for patients\n< 40 kg (80/40 mg). \n\nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (± SD) adalimumab trough concentrations at \nweek 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 μg/mL for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 μg/mL for the Low Dose group. \nThe mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to receive adalimumab treatment \neow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly regimen, the mean (± SD) serum \nconcentrations of adalimumab at week 52 were 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/mL (40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 ± 3.5 μg/mL\n(20/10 mg, weekly). \n\nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg\nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 μg/mL\nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 μg/mL were observed in \nulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n\nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg\nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of\napproximately 8 to 10 μg/mL.\n\nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic\nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients (paediatric \npsoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related arthritis). No clinical \nexposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. The predicted exposures \nindicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial increase in systemic \nexposure.\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation predicted\ncomparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other week when\ncompared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, patients with\nadolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD).\n\nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population\n\nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response relationship \nwas established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent adalimumab plasma \nconcentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response (EC50) was 3 µg/mL\n(95 % CI: 1-6 µg/mL).\n\nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients with \nsevere chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, respectively. \nPASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, both with a \nsimilar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 µg/mL (95 % CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, respectively).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n50\n\nElimination\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward higher \napparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.

The serum levels of free \nadalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in patients with \nmeasurable AAA. \n\nHepatic or renal impairment\n\nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated dose \ntoxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in cynomolgus \nmonkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm to the foetuses \ndue to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of fertility and postnatal \ntoxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an antibody with limited \ncross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents.\n\n6.

What Cyltezo is and what it is used for\n\nCyltezo contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body’s immune (defence) \nsystem. \n\nCyltezo is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below:\n Rheumatoid arthritis, \n Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n Enthesitis-related arthritis, \n Ankylosing spondylitis, \n Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, \n Psoriatic arthritis, \n Psoriasis, \n Hidradenitis suppurativa, \n Crohn’s disease,\n Ulcerative colitis and \n Non-infectious uveitis\n\nThe active ingredient in Cyltezo, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins \nthat attach to a specific target.\n\nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is present at increased \nlevels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNFα, Cyltezo decreases the process of \ninflammation in these diseases.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n70\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid \narthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines\ndo not work well enough, you will be given Cyltezo to treat your rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nCyltezo can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous\nmethotrexate treatment. \n\nCyltezo can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve \nphysical function.\n\nUsually, Cyltezo is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, \nCyltezo can be given alone.\n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis\n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of the \njoints that usually first appear in childhood.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 \nyears and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may first be \ngiven other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well enough, \npatients will be given Cyltezo to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related\narthritis.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, \nare inflammatory diseases of the spine.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of \nankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines\ndo not work well enough, you will be given Cyltezo to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Cyltezo can slow down the damage to the cartilage and \nbone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function.\n\nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children\n\nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with \nsilvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift\naway from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body’s \nimmune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Cyltezo is also used to treat severe \nplaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical therapy and phototherapies \nhave either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n71\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. \nCyltezo can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often associated with \nthe disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be \ngiven Cyltezo.\n\nCrohn’s disease in adults and children\n\nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.\n\nAdalimumab is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn’s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be \ngiven Cyltezo to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s disease.\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given other \nmedicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Cyltezo to reduce the signs and \nsymptoms of your disease.\n\nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children\n\nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. Cyltezo works by \nreducing this inflammation.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat\n Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye\n Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the\n\nfront of the eye\n\nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Cyltezo\n\nDo not use Cyltezo\n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\n If you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see “Warnings and precautions”). It is important \nthat you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental \nproblems. \n\n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a \nserious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n72\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Cyltezo\n\nAllergic reaction\n\n If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or \nrash do not inject more Cyltezo and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these reactions \ncan be life threatening.\n\nInfection\n\n If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your \ndoctor before starting Cyltezo. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.\n\n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Cyltezo treatment. This risk may increase \nif your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections \ncaused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, other opportunistic infections (unusual infections \nassociated with a weakened immune system) and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these \ninfections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of \nCyltezo.\n\nTuberculosis\n\n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will check \nyou for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Cyltezo. This will include a thorough \nmedical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example chest X-ray and a \ntuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your patient alert card. It is \nvery important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close \ncontact with someone who has had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you \nhave received preventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, \nweight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately.\n\nTravel/recurrent infection\n\n Tell your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis,\ncoccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.\n\n Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of \ninfections.\n\nHepatitis B virus\n\n Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have an active HBV infection \nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. Cyltezo\ncan reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, especially if you are \ntaking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-\nthreatening. \n\nAge over 65 years\n\n If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Cyltezo. You and your \ndoctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with Cyltezo. It is \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n73\n\nimportant to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or \ndental problems.\n\nSurgery or dental procedure\n\n If you are about to have a surgery or dental procedures, tell your doctor that you are taking Cyltezo. \nYour doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Cyltezo.\n\nDemyelinating disease\n\n If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the \nnerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to receive\nCyltezo. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in \nyour arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body.\n\nVaccine\n\n Certain vaccines contain weakened but live forms of bacteria or viruses that cause diseases, and should \nnot be given while receiving Cyltezo because they may cause infections. Check with your doctor before \nyou receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled \nvaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Cyltezo. If you received Cyltezo while you \nare pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after \nthe last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your Cyltezo use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your \nbaby should receive any vaccine.\n\nHeart Failure\n\n If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Cyltezo, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious \nheart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or \nswelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will decide if you should \nreceive Cyltezo.\n\nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale\n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells to fight off infections or help \nyou to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed very easily or \nlook very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment.\n\nCancer\n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking adalimumab or \nother TNFα blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long \ntime may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph system), \nand leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If you take Cyltezo the risk of getting \nlymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of \nlymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated \nwith the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or \nmercaptopurine with Cyltezo. \n\n In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. If \nnew areas of damaged skin appear during or after therapy or if existing marks or areas of damage\nchange appearance, tell your doctor.\n\n There have been cases of cancers other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung disease \ncalled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNFα blocker. If you have \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n74\n\nCOPD, or you are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNFα\nblocker is appropriate for you.\n\nLupus-like syndrome\n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Cyltezo could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your doctor if \nsymptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\n Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Cyltezo.\n Do not give Cyltezo to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 years.\n Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe, if doses other than 40 mg are recommended.\n\nOther medicines and Cyltezo\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nCyltezo can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nYou should not take Cyltezo with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to\nincreased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for \nat least 5 months after the last Cyltezo treatment.\n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for\nadvice about taking this medicine.\n\n Cyltezo should only be used during a pregnancy if needed.\n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had\n\nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not\nreceive adalimumab.\n\n Cyltezo can be used during breast-feeding.\n If you receive Cyltezo during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an\n\ninfection.\n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your\n\nCyltezo use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on \nvaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section).\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nCyltezo may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Cyltezo.\n\nThe needle cover of the syringe contains latex\n\nThe inner part of the cap (the needle cover) of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex). This may cause \nsevere allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.\n\nCyltezo contains sodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 mL dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n75\n\n3.

What Cyltezo is and what it is used for\n\nCyltezo contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body’s immune (defence) \nsystem. \n\nCyltezo is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below:\n Rheumatoid arthritis, \n Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n Enthesitis-related arthritis, \n Ankylosing spondylitis, \n Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, \n Psoriatic arthritis, \n Psoriasis, \n Hidradenitis suppurativa, \n Crohn’s disease,\n Ulcerative colitis and \n Non-infectious uveitis\n\nThe active ingredient in Cyltezo, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins \nthat attach to a specific target. \n\nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is present at increased \nlevels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNFα, Cyltezo decreases the process of \ninflammation in these diseases.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n91\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid \narthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines\ndo not work well enough, you will be given Cyltezo to treat your rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nCyltezo can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n\nCyltezo can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve \nphysical function.\n\nUsually, Cyltezo is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, \nCyltezo can be given alone.\n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis\n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of the \njoints that usually first appear in childhood.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 \nyears and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may first be \ngiven other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well enough, \npatients will be given Cyltezo to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related \narthritis.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, \nare inflammatory diseases of the spine.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of \nankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines\ndo not work well enough, you will be given Cyltezo to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Cyltezo can slow down the damage to the cartilage and \nbone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function.\n\nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children\n\nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with \nsilvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift\naway from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body’s \nimmune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Cyltezo is also used to treat severe \nplaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical therapy and phototherapies \nhave either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n92\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. \nCyltezo can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often associated with \nthe disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be \ngiven Cyltezo.\n\nCrohn’s disease in adults and children\n\nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.\n\nAdalimumab is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn’s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be \ngiven Cyltezo to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s disease.\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given other \nmedicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Cyltezo to reduce the signs and \nsymptoms of your disease.\n\nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children\n\nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. Cyltezo works by \nreducing this inflammation.\n\nCyltezo is used to treat\n Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye\n Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the\n\nfront of the eye\n\nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Cyltezo\n\nDo not use Cyltezo\n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\n If you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see “Warnings and precautions”). It is important \nthat you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental \nproblems. \n\n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a \nserious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n93\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Cyltezo\n\nAllergic reaction\n\n If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or \nrash do not inject more Cyltezo and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these reactions \ncan be life threatening.\n\nInfection\n\n If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your \ndoctor before starting Cyltezo. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.\n\n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Cyltezo treatment. This risk may increase \nif your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections \ncaused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, other opportunistic infections (unusual infections \nassociated with a weakened immune system) and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these \ninfections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of \nCyltezo.\n\nTuberculosis\n\n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will check \nyou for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Cyltezo. This will include a thorough \nmedical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example chest X-ray and a \ntuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your patient alert card. It is \nvery important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close \ncontact with someone who has had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you \nhave received preventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, \nweight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately.\n\nTravel/recurrent infection\n\n Tell your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis,\ncoccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.\n\n Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of \ninfections.\n\nHepatitis B virus\n\n Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have an active HBV infection \nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. Cyltezo\ncan reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, especially if you are \ntaking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-\nthreatening. \n\nAge over 65 years\n\n If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Cyltezo. You and your \ndoctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with Cyltezo.

Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in \nyour arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body.\n\nVaccine\n\n Certain vaccines contain weakened but live forms of bacteria or viruses that cause diseases, and should \nnot be given while receiving Cyltezo because they may cause infections. Check with your doctor before \nyou receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled \nvaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Cyltezo. If you received Cyltezo while you \nare pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after \nthe last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your Cyltezo use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your \nbaby should receive any vaccine.\n\nHeart Failure\n\n If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Cyltezo, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious \nheart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or \nswelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will decide if you should \nreceive Cyltezo.\n\nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale\n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells to fight off infections or help \nyou to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed very easily or \nlook very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment.\n\nCancer\n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking adalimumab or \nother TNFα blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long \ntime may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph system), \nand leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If you take Cyltezo the risk of getting \nlymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of \nlymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated \nwith the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or \nmercaptopurine with Cyltezo. \n\n In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. If \nnew areas of damaged skin appear during or after therapy or if existing marks or areas of damage\nchange appearance, tell your doctor.\n\n There have been cases of cancers other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung disease \ncalled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNFα blocker. If you have \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n95\n\nCOPD, or you are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNFα\nblocker is appropriate for you.\n\nLupus-like syndrome\n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Cyltezo could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your doctor if \nsymptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\n Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Cyltezo.\n Do not give Cyltezo to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 years.\n Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled pen, if doses other than 40 mg are recommended.\n\nOther medicines and Cyltezo\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nCyltezo can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nYou should not take Cyltezo with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to\nincreased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for \nat least 5 months after the last Cyltezo treatment.\n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for\nadvice about taking this medicine.\n\n Cyltezo should only be used during a pregnancy if needed.\n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had\n\nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not\nreceive adalimumab.\n\n Cyltezo can be used during breast-feeding.\n If you receive Cyltezo during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an\n\ninfection.\n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your\n\nCyltezo use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on \nvaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section).\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nCyltezo may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Cyltezo.\n\nThe needle cover of the syringe contains latex\n\nThe inner part of the cap (the needle cover) of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex). This may cause \nsevere allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.\n\nCyltezo contains sodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 mL dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n96\n\n3. How to use Cyltezo\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis\nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis\n\nThe usual dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \ngiven every other week as a single dose.\n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Cyltezo. If your doctor determines that \nmethotrexate is inappropriate, Cyltezo can be given alone.\n\nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Cyltezo therapy, your doctor \nmay decide to give 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other week.\n\nChildren, adolescents and adults with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis\n\nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg\n\nCyltezo is only available as 40 mg pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen. Thus, it is not possible to use Cyltezo \nfor children who require less than a full 40 mg dose.
