This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n\n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nCoagadex 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.   \n\nCoagadex 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\n Each vial contains nominally 250 IU or 500 IU human coagulation factor X. \n\n \n\nCoagadex contains approximately 100 IU/mL human coagulation factor X after reconstitution with 2.5 mL \n\n(250 IU) or 5 mL (500 IU) sterilised water for injections.  \n\n \n\nProduced from the plasma of human donors. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect: \n\nCoagadex contains up to 0.4 mmol/mL (9.2 mg/mL) of sodium.  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\n \n\nPowder vial containing white or off-white powder.  \n\n \n\nSolvent vial containing clear colourless liquid. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nCoagadex is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes and for perioperative \n\nmanagement in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency.  \n\n \n\nCoagadex is indicated in all age groups \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of rare \n\nbleeding disorders. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe dose and duration of the treatment depend on the severity of the factor X deficiency (i.e. the patient’s \n\nbaseline factor X level), on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.  \n\nCareful control of replacement therapy is especially important in cases of major surgery or life-threatening \n\nbleeding episodes. \n\n \n\nNot more than 60 IU/kg daily should be administered in any age group. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nIn adults and adolescents at least 12 years of age, the expected in vivo peak increase in factor X level expressed \n\nas IU/dL (or % of normal) can be estimated using the following formulae: \n\n \n\nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor X rise (IU/dL or % of normal) x 0.5  \n\n                        \n\nOR \n\n \n\nIncrease in factor X level (IU/dL or % of normal) = [total dose (IU)/body weight (kg)] x 2  \n\n       \n\nThe following examples assume the patient’s baseline factor X level is <1 IU/dL: \n\n1. A dose of 2000 IU Coagadex administered to a 70 kg patient should be expected to result in a peak post-\n\ninfusion factor X increase of 2000 x {[2 IU/dL]/[IU/kg]}/[70 kg] = 57 IU/dL (i.e. 57% of normal) \n\n2. A peak factor X level of 90% of normal is required in a 70 kg patient.  In this situation, the appropriate \n\ndose would be: \n\n   70 kg x 90 IU/dL/{[2 IU/dL]/[IU/kg]} = 3150 IU. \n\nThe dose and frequency should be based on the individual clinical response.  Patients may vary in their \n\npharmacokinetic (e.g. half-life, in vivo recovery) and clinical responses to Coagadex.  Although the dose can \n\nbe estimated using the calculations above, whenever possible appropriate laboratory tests, such as serial factor \n\nX assays, should be performed to guide dose adjustments. \n\n \n\nControl of Bleeding Episodes \n\nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years or more for treatment of bleeding episodes: 25 IU/kg Coagadex should \n\nbe injected when the first sign of bleeding occurs or just before the expected onset of menstrual bleeding.  \n\nRepeat at intervals of 24 hours until the bleed stops.  Judge each individual bleed on its own severity.   \n\n \nFor secondary prophylaxis against re-bleeding or short-term prophylaxis prior to anticipated physical activity \nor dental appointments: 25 IU/kg Coagadex should be injected and repeated as required. \n\n \n\nRoutine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes \n\nDue to inter-and intra-patient variability, it is recommended that trough blood levels of Factor X should be \n\nmonitored at intervals, especially in the first weeks of therapy or after dosage changes.  Adjust dosage \n\nregimen to clinical response and trough levels of Factor X of at least 5 IU/dL.  \n\n \n\nThere are limited data on the use of Coagadex for long periods of prophylaxis in adults. There are no data \n\navailable on routine prophylaxis in paediatric patients aged >12 to <18 years. 25 IU/kg twice weekly is the \n\nproposed starting dose for prophylaxis in patients >12 years of age with dose levels and dosing intervals to \n\nbe adjusted as clinically indicated.  Depending on individual clinical response, longer intervals, e.g. once \n\nweekly, might be adequate (see section 5.1). \n \nPerioperative Management (Adults and adolescents aged at least 12 years of age) \nPre-surgery: calculate dose of Coagadex to raise plasma factor X levels to 70-90 IU/dL.  The careful control \nof dose and duration of treatment is especially important in cases of major surgery. \n\nRequired dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor X rise (IU/dL) x 0.5 \n\nThe desired factor X rise is the difference between the patient’s plasma factor X level and the desired level, \n\nand based on the observed recovery of 2 IU/dL per IU/kg. \n\nExample:  to raise plasma factor X level from 15 IU/dL to 90 IU/dL in a 70 kg patient, the appropriate dose is:  \n\n70 x (90-15) x 0.5 = 2,625 IU. \n\nPost-surgery: dose as necessary to maintain plasma factor X levels at a minimum of 50 IU/dL until the \n\nsubject is no longer at risk of bleeding due to surgery.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIt is recommended that post-infusion plasma factor X levels are measured for each patient before and after \n\nsurgery, to ensure that haemostatic levels are obtained and maintained. \n\n \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary. \n\n \n \n\nPaediatric population (less than 12 years of age) \n\nFor on-demand control of bleeding in children aged less than 12 years: 30 IU/kg Coagadex should be \n\ninjected when the first sign of bleeding occurs. Repeat at intervals of 24 hours until the bleed stops. Judge \n\neach individual bleed on its own severity.   \n\n \nFor secondary prophylaxis against re-bleeding or short-term prophylaxis prior to anticipated physical activity \nor dental appointments: 30 IU/kg Coagadex should be injected and repeated as required. \n\nFor routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in children aged less than 12 years: 40 IU/kg twice weekly. \n\nDue to inter-and intra-patient variability, it is recommended that trough blood levels of Factor X should be \n\nmonitored at intervals, especially in the first weeks of therapy or after dosage changes. Adjust dosage \n\nregimen to clinical response and trough levels of Factor X of at least 5 IU/dL. Some patients may achieve \n\ndesired FX trough levels on once weekly prophylactic therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nFor perioperative management in children aged less than 12 years: Pre-surgery: calculate dose of \nCoagadex to raise plasma factor X levels to 70-90 IU/dL.  The careful control of dose and duration of \ntreatment is especially important in cases of major surgery. \n\n \n\nThe expected in vivo peak increase in factor X level expressed as IU/dL (or % of normal) can be estimated \n\nusing the following formulae: \n\n \n\nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor X rise (IU/dL or % of normal) x 0.6  \n\n                        \n\nOR \n\n \n\nIncrease in factor X level (IU/dL or % of normal) = [total dose (IU)/body weight (kg)] x 1.7  \n \n\nPost-surgery: dose as necessary to maintain plasma factor X levels at a minimum of 50 IU/dL until the \n\nsubject is no longer at risk of bleeding due to surgery.  \n\nIt is recommended that post-infusion plasma factor X levels are measured for each patient before and after \n\nsurgery, to ensure that haemostatic levels are obtained and maintained. \n\n \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nIntravenous use. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution, the product should be administered by the intravenous route at a suggested rate of \n\n10 mL/min, but no more than 20 mL/min. \n\n \n\nFor home therapy, the patient should be given appropriate training and reviewed at intervals. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n  \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible. Coagadex contains traces of \n\nhuman proteins other than factor X. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity \n\nreactions including angioedema, infusion site inflammation (e.g. burning, stinging, erythema), chills, cough, \n\ndizziness, fever, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, musculoskeletal \n\npains, nausea, pruritus, rash, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing. If \n\nany of these symptoms occur, they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and \n\ncontact their physician.  In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nInhibitors \n\nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor X is a possible complication in the management \n\nof individuals with factor X deficiency.  \n\n \n\nIn general, all patients treated with Coagadex should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors \n\nby appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.  If expected factor X activity levels are not attained, \n\nor if bleeding is not controlled with an expected dose, perform an assay that measures factor X inhibitor \n\nconcentration. \n\n \n\nTransmissible Agents \n\nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human \n\nblood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific \n\nmarkers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of \n\nviruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \n\npossibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or \n\nemerging viruses and other pathogens. \n\n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and for the \n\nnon-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19. \n\n \n\nVaccination against hepatitis A and B in patients who regularly or repeatedly receive human plasma-derived \n\nFactor X products may be warranted. \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Coagadex is administered to a patient, the name and batch \n\nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the product. \n\n \n\nSodium Content \n\nCoagadex contains up to 0.4 mmol/mL (9.2 mg/mL) of sodium. To be taken into consideration for patients \n\non a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nCoagadex is likely to be counteracted by factor Xa inhibitors, direct or indirect. These antithrombotic agents \n\nshould not be used in patients with factor X deficiency. Coagadex should not be used as an antidote to the \n\neffects of direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) in patients who do not have factor X deficiency. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPregnancy \n\nDue to the rarity of hereditary factor X deficiency, experience regarding the use of Coagadex during pregnancy \n\nand breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, Coagadex should be used during pregnancy only if clearly \n\nindicated. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nDue to the rarity of hereditary factor X deficiency, experience regarding the use of Coagadex during pregnancy \n\nand breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, Coagadex should be used during breast-feeding only if clearly \n\nindicated. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Coagadex.  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nCoagadex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\n \nThe adverse reactions that occurred in the highest frequency were infusion site erythema, infusion site pain, \n\nfatigue, and back pain.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion \n\nsite, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, \n\ntachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely with treatment of \n\nother haemophilias and may in some cases have progressed to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n\nHypersensitivity reactions, allergic reactions, and anaphylaxis have not been reported in Coagadex clinical \n\ntrials. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies involving 27 patients treated with \n\nCoagadex.

It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n7 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in \n\nAppendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOne case of accidental overdose was reported in the clinical trials, in which a subject received approximately \n\n80 IU/kg Coagadex to treat a bleed.  No adverse events were reported relating to this overdose. There is a \n\npotential for thromboembolism with overdose. \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-haemorrhagics, vitamin K and other haemostatics, coagulation factor X, \n\nATC code: B02BD13. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nFactor X is an inactive zymogen, which can be activated by factor IXa (via the intrinsic pathway) or by factor \n\nVIIa (via the extrinsic pathway).  Factor X is converted from its inactive form to the active form (factor Xa) \n\nby the cleavage of a 52-residue peptide from the heavy chain.  Factor Xa associates with factor Va on a \n\nphospholipid surface to form the prothrombinase complex, which activates prothrombin to thrombin in the \n\npresence of calcium ions. Thrombin then acts upon soluble fibrinogen and factor XIII to generate a cross-\n\nlinked fibrin clot. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nCoagadex is derived from human plasma and used as a replacement for the naturally existing coagulation factor \n\nX in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nIn a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy \n\nof Coagadex, 16 subjects (aged 12 years and above) with moderate to severe hereditary factor X deficiency \n\n(FX:C < 5 IU/dL) received a dose of 25 IU/kg Coagadex to treat spontaneous, traumatic and menorrhagic \n\nbleeding episodes. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of Coagadex in treating bleeding episodes was assessed by the subject and/or investigator for \n\neach new bleeding episode, using a pre-determined bleed-specific ordinal rating scale of excellent, good, poor \n\nand unassessable. Of the 208 bleeding episodes treated with Coagadex, 187 bleeding episodes in 15 subjects \n\nwere evaluated for efficacy. Ninety eight (53%) were major bleeding episodes, and 88 (47%) were minor \n\nbleeds (one bleed was not assessed). Coagadex was considered to be good (7%) or excellent (91%) in treating \n\n98% of bleeding episodes. Of the 187 bleeding episodes in the efficacy analysis, 155 bleeds (83%) were treated \n\nwith one infusion, 28 bleeds (15%) with two infusions, 3 bleeds (2%) with three infusions and 1 bleed (0.5%) \n\nwith four infusions. The mean dose per infusion and total dose of Coagadex were 25.4 IU/kg and 30.4 IU/kg, \n\nrespectively. Four bleeding episodes in two subjects were considered treatment failures. The recommended \n\ndose of 25 IU/kg Coagadex to treat a bleed was maintained during the study for 14 of the 16 subjects. The \n\nother two subjects used doses up to 30 IU/kg and 33 IU/kg.  \n\nA total of 184 infusions of Coagadex were given as a preventative measure. Routine prophylaxis was used \n\nby two subjects. One subject, aged 58 years, used 28 IU/kg once weekly for 8 weeks and, later, 25 IU/kg \n\nevery 2 weeks for more than 5 months. The other subject, aged 22 years, used 24.6 IU/kg once weekly for \n\n8.5 months. Neither subject had any bleeds during these periods.  \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of Bleeding Episodes \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe third study evaluated the use of Coagadex in routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in nine children \n\naged less than 12 years of age. The mean age was 7.3 (range 2.6 to 11.9) years. Eight subjects had severe FX \n\ndeficiency,  the other had moderate deficiency. Four subjects were aged 0 to 5 years and five were aged 6 to \n\n11 years inclusive. Routine prophylaxis was started with unit doses of 40-50 IU/kg and during the first 6 weeks \n\ntrough levels of Factor X were measured to adjust the dosage regimen to maintain a trough level of at least 5 \n\nIU/dL. A total of 537 (mean 59.7 per subject) prophylactic infusions were administered. The median \n\nprophylactic dose per infusion per subject was 39.60 IU/kg (mean 38.76 IU/kg), and ranged from 18.0 to 47.3 \n\nIU/kg. Median and mean doses per infusion in the four children less than 6 years of age were both 40.1 IU/kg \n\n(95% CI 30.70, 49.57) and in the five children 6 to 11 years of age inclusive, median dose was 39.6 IU/kg and \n\nmean dose was 37.7 IU/kg (95% CI: 23.42, 51.91). The median dosing interval for all of the nine children was \n\n3 days (range 2 to 8 days).  Six children (66.7%) remained free of bleeds during routine prophylaxis. Three \n\nchildren (33.3%), one in the 0-5 years age group and two in the 6-11 years age group had a total of 10 bleeds \n\ndue to epistaxes, trauma or menorrhagia. All were treated with a single infusion of Coagadex; mean and median \n\ndoses 31.7 IU/kg (range 24.6 to 38.8 IU/kg) and all recorded efficacy ratings were categorized as excellent. \n\nThere were no adverse drug reactions in this study in children less than 12 years of age. \n\n \n\nSurgical haemostasis \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Coagadex for perioperative management was evaluated in five subjects aged 14 to \n\n59 years with mild (n=2), moderate (n=1), and severe (n=2) disease, who underwent a total of seven surgical \n\nprocedures. \n\n \n\nFor all surgical procedures, Coagadex was assessed as excellent (no post-operative bleeding, no requirement \n\nof blood transfusions, and blood loss was no more than ‘as expected’) in controlling blood loss during and \n\nafter surgery. For major surgery, a median of 13 infusions (range 2 to 15 infusions) and a median cumulative \n\ndose of 181 IU/kg (range 45 to 210 IU/kg) were required to maintain haemostasis. For minor surgery, a median \n\nof 2.5 infusions (range 1 to 4 infusions) and a median cumulative dose of 89 IU/kg (range 51 to 127 IU/kg) \n\nwere used to maintain haemostasis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nIn a clinical study of Coagadex in subjects with severe or moderate factor X deficiency (basal FX:C <5 IU/dL), \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of Coagadex were assessed in 16 subjects after administration of a nominal dose of 25 \n\nIU/kg. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated from plasma factor X:C (one-stage clotting assay) \n\nactivity measurements after subtraction of the pre-dose value.  Combining IR values for FX:C at the baseline \n\nvisit (n=16) and the Repeat PK assessment (n=15) gave an overall geometric mean IR of 2.07 IU/dL per IU/kg \n\nadministered (n=31). Similarly, combining t½ values at the Baseline Visit and the Repeat PK assessment gave \n\nan overall geometric mean t½ of 29.36 hours. Systemic exposure to FX:C at the Repeat PK visit (at least 6 \n\nmonths later) was equivalent to that at baseline, since repeat/baseline ratios for all PK parameters were within \n\nthe range of 90% to 110%.  \n\n \nThe mean (CV%) for incremental recovery was 2.08 (18.1). The mean (CV%) maximum plasma concentration \n(Cmax) was 0.504 (17.2) IU/mL.  \nThe mean (CV%) for area under the curve (AUC 0-144h) was 17.1 (21.0) IU.hr/mL.  \n\nHuman coagulation factor X is largely retained within the vascular compartment: mean apparent volume of \n\ndistribution (Vss) was 56.3 (24.0) mL/kg. \n\nThe mean (CV%) half-life of human coagulation factor X was 30.3 (22.8) hr and clearance was 1.35 (21.7) \n\nmL/kg/hr. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted but there is no anticipated effect of gender or renal function \n\non the pharmacokinetic profile of Coagadex. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted but there is no anticipated effect of gender or hepatic function \n\non the pharmacokinetic profile of Coagadex. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted but there is no anticipated effect of age on the \n\npharmacokinetic profile of Coagadex. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in children under the age of 12 years. The study in young \n\nchildren (see section 5.1) measured incremental recovery at 30 min (IR30min) after the first dose and after the \n\nlast dose in the study (approximately 6 months later) (see section 5.1) Combining IR30min values for FX:C at \n\nthe baseline visit (n=9) and the Repeat PK assessment (n=9) gave an overall geometric mean IR of 1.74 (range \n\n1.3-2.2) IU/dL per IU/kg administered (n=9). For the subgroup aged 6-11 years (n=5), the geometric mean \n\nIR30min was 1.91 (range 1.6 -2.2) IU/mL per IU/kg and for the youngest subgroup, 0-5 years (n=4) was \n\n1.53range 1.3-1.8) IU/mL per IU/kg. \n\nTrough levels of FX:C were measured during the first 6 weeks of the study to individualise the dosage regimen \n\nand to maintain a trough level of at least 5 IU/dL. During the dose-adjustment phase, two trough levels were \n\n<5 IU/dL but thereafter none were below this threshold. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \n\nsingle and repeat-dose toxicity, thrombogenicity and local tolerability. \n\n \n\nNo investigations on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive or developmental toxitcity have been \n\nconducted since human plasma coagulation factor X (as contained in Coagadex) is an endogenous protein. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n27 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \n\nCoagadex 250 IU \n\nCoagadex 500 IU \n powder and solvent for solution for injection  \n\n \n\nhuman coagulation factor X \n\n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \n\nreport side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\n          their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\n-     If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side  \n\n          effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Coagadex is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Coagadex   \n\n3. How to use Coagadex \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Coagadex   \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Coagadex is and what it is used for \n\nCoagadex is a  concentrate of human coagulation factor X, a protein that is needed for blood to clot. The \n\nfactor X in Coagadex is extracted from human plasma (the liquid part of blood). It is used to treat and \n\nprevent bleeding in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency, including during surgery.  \n\n \n\nPatients with factor X deficiency do not have sufficient factor X for their blood to clot properly, leading to \n\nexcessive bleeding. Coagadex replaces the missing factor X and allows their  blood to clot normally.  \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Coagadex \n\n \n\nDo not use Coagadex: \n\n- if you are allergic to human coagulation factor X or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).  \n\nCheck with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Coagadex:   \n\n \n\n-if you have a larger or longer bleed than usual and the bleeding does not stop after an injection of Coagadex. \n\n \n\nSome patients with a shortage of factor X may develop inhibitors (antibodies) to factor X during treatment. \n\nThis could mean that the treatment will not work properly. Your doctor will check regularly for the \n\ndevelopment of these antibodies, and especially before an operation. Both before and after treatment with this \n\nmedicine, particularly for your first course of treatment, your doctor will probably carry out tests to check the \n\nlevel of factor X in your blood. \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nVirus safety \n\nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent \n\ninfections being passed on to recipients. These include: \n\n \n\n– careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, \n\n– the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections, \n\n– the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. \n\n \n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for the following viruses: human immunodeficiency virus \n\n(HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. Despite these measures, \n\nwhen medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on an \n\ninfection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of \n\ninfections. \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Coagadex, the name and batch number of \n\nthe product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you regularly or \n\nrepeatedly receive human plasma-derived factor X products. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe listed warnings and precautions for adults also apply to children (aged 2 to 11 years) and adolescents \n\n(aged 12 to 18 years). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Coagadex \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Certain \n\nanticoagulants including those blocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) should not be used in patients \n\nwith factor X deficiency receiving Coagadex due to a risk of blood clots. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThere are no known effects of this medicine on the ability to drive or operate machinery. \n\n \n\nCoagadex contains sodium \n\nThis medicinal product contains up to 0.4 mmol/mL (9.2 mg/mL) of sodium. This should be taken into \n\nconsideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Coagadex \n\nYour treatment should be initiated by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of bleeding disorders. \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\n \n\nCoagadex should be injected directly into a vein. Before injecting this medicine at home, you should have \n\nreceived training by your healthcare professional on how to do so.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will explain to you how much you should use, when you should use it and for how long. Your \n\ndoctor will usually tell you your dose in terms of the number of full vials that supply the dose most suited to \n\nyou. Not more than 60 IU/kg daily should be administered in any age group. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nAdult \n\n \n\nHow much Coagadex is given to treat a bleed or prevent further bleeding? \n\nYour doctor will tell you how much Coagadex to administer to treat a bleed and to prevent further bleeding; \n\nthe dose required will depend on your normal blood level of factor X \n\n \n\nHow much is given before, during and after major surgery? \n\nBefore: The dose of Coagadex used should be sufficient to raise your blood factor X level to between 70 and \n\n90 units/dL. The dose you need will depend on your normal blood level of factor X and will be calculated by \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\nAfter: During the first few days after the operation, your plasma factor X concentration will be checked \n\nregularly. It is recommended that your blood factor X level is kept above 50 units/dL. The dose you need \n\nwill be calculated by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf your blood factor X concentration is too low (this will be tested by your doctor), or if it decreases faster \n\nthan expected, an inhibitor to factor X may be present which stops Coagadex from working properly. Your \n\ndoctor will arrange for the appropriate laboratory tests to see if this is the case. \n\n \n\nHow much is given regularly for long-term prevention of bleeds? \n\nYour doctor will advise if this use is suitable for you and, if so, of the appropriate dose. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nYour doctor will recommend an appropriate dose for you. Generally the doses for children less than 12 years \n\nold are larger than doses for adolescents which should follow those in adults. \n\n \n\nWhen to inject Coagadex \n\n• The medicine should be injected when the first sign of bleeding occurs \n\n• The injection should be repeated as necessary to stop the bleeding \n\n• Each individual bleed should be judged on its own severity \n\n• If you are using this medicine for the first time, your doctor will supervise you \n\n \n\nDissolving your medicines before use \n\nYour medicine must only be dissolved in the solvent provided with the product. \n\n \n\nQuantity of Coagadex Volume of solvent \n\n250 IU 2.5 mL \n\n500 IU 5 mL \n\n \n\nCoagadex is supplied with the amount of solvent as shown in the table. \n\n \n\nYou can dissolve Coagadex using the needle-free Mix2Vial transfer device included within each pack.  \n\nBring the containers of Coagadex to room temperature before mixing. \n\nMake up the medicine as follows: \n\n  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n Step 1 \n\n• Remove the cap from the powder vial and clean the top of the \n\nstopper with an alcohol swab. \n\n• Repeat this step with the vial of solvent. \n\n• Peel back the top of the transfer device package but leave the device in the \n\npackage. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 2 \n\n• Place the blue end of the transfer device on the solvent vial and push straight \n\ndown until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and snaps into place. \n\n• Remove the plastic outer packaging from the transfer device and discard it, \n\ntaking care not to touch the exposed end of the device. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 3 \n\n• Turn the solvent vial upside down with the device still attached. \n\n• Place the clear end of the transfer device on the powder vial and push \n\nstraight down until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and snaps into \n\nplace. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Step 4 \n\n• The solvent will be pulled into the powder vial by the vacuum contained \n\nwithin it. \n\n• Gently swirl the vial to make sure the powder is thoroughly mixed. Do not \n\nshake the vial. \n\n• A clear or slightly pearl-like solution should be obtained, usually in about 1 \n\nminute (5 minutes maximum). \n\n \n\n \nStep 5 \n\n• Separate the empty solvent vial and blue part from the clear part by \n\nunscrewing anti-clockwise. \n\n• Draw air into the syringe by pulling the plunger to the required volume of \n\nwater added. \n\n• Connect the syringe to the clear part of the transfer device and push the air \n\nin the syringe into the vial. \n\n  \n\nStep 6 \n\n• Immediately invert the vial of solution, which will be drawn into the \n\nsyringe. \n\n• Disconnect the filled syringe from the device. \n\n• The product is now ready for use. Follow the normal safety practices for \n\nadministration. Make sure you use the product within an hour after it has been \n\nmade up. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nDo not use this medicine: \n\n \n\n- if the solvent is not pulled into the vial (this indicates loss of vacuum in the vial, so the \npowder must not be used). \n\n \n\n- if the dissolved powder and solvent form a gel or a clot (if this happens please tell your healthcare \nprovider, reporting the batch number printed on the vial). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Coagadex than you should \n\nIf you administer more Coagadex than your doctor prescribed, it is possible you might develop a blood clot. \n\nIf you think you may be using too much, stop the injection and tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse. If you \n\nknow you have used too much, tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible.  \n\n  \n\nIf you forget to use Coagadex \n\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Inject your normal dose as you remember and then \n\ncontinue dosing as instructed by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Coagadex \n\nAlways consult your doctor before deciding to stop your treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions) have occurred rarely in the treatment of bleeding disorders \n\nwith similar medicines (affecting up to 1 in 1,000 people), and sometimes progress to shock.  Signs of these \n\nmay include skin rash (including hives), tingling, flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache, cough, wheezing, \n\ntightness of the chest, chills, fast heart rate, dizziness, lethargy, restlessness, swelling of the face, tightness of \n\nthe throat, discomfort at the site of injection.  \n\nIf you get any of these contact your doctor.  \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have been reported with Coagadex. \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n• pain or redness at site of injection \n\n• tiredness \n\n• back pain \n \n\nSide effects in children and adolescents \n\nSide effects in children are expected to be the same as in adults. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \n\nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n5. How to store Coagadex \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the containers after “EXP”.  The expiry date \n\nrefers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nDo not store above 30C.   \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nDo not freeze.  \n\n \n\nKeep container in the outer carton in order to protect it from light. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine if you notice small bits in the dissolved product. Once made up, Coagadex must be \n\nused within one hour.  \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Your treatment centre will provide a \n\nspecial container to dispose of any solution that remains, any used syringes, needles and empty containers. \n\nThese measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n6.
