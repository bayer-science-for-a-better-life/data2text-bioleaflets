CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReplacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) in: \n \n- Primary immunodeficiency syndromes (PID) with impaired antibody production \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 3 - \n \n\n- Secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent infections, \nineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF)* or \nserum IgG level of <4 g/l  \n\n \n*PSAF= failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide \nand polypeptide antigen vaccines \n \nImmunomodulation in adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) in: \n \n- Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), in patients at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery \n\nto correct the platelet count \n \n- Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome \n \n- Kawasaki disease (in conjunction with acetylsalicylic acid; see 4.2) \n\n \n- Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) \n\n \n- Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nReplacement therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose and dose regimen is dependent on the indication. \n \nThe dose may need to be individualised for each patient dependent on the clinical response. Dose \nbased on body weight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. The following \ndose regimens are given as a guideline. \n \nReplacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes \n \nThe dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG (measured before the next infusion) of at least \n6 g/l or within the normal reference range for the population age. Three to six months are required \nafter the initiation of therapy for equilibration (steady-state IgG levels) to occur. The recommended \nstarting dose is 0.4 - 0.8 g/kg given once followed by at least 0.2 g/kg given every three to four weeks. \n \nThe dose required to achieve a trough level of IgG of 6 g/l is of the order of 0.2 - 0.8 g/kg/month. The \ndose interval when steady state has been reached varies from 3 - 4 weeks. \n \nIgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. To \nreduce the rate of bacterial infections, it may be necessary to increase the dosage and aim for higher \ntrough levels. \n \nSecondary immunodeficiencies (as defined in 4.1) \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.2 - 0.4 g/kg every three to four weeks. \n \nIgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. \nDose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an increase \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 4 - \n \n\nmay be necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when the \npatient remains infection free. \n \nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia \n \nThere are two alternative treatment schedules: \n\u2022 0.8 - 1 g/kg given on day one; this dose may be repeated once within 3 days. \n\u2022 0.4 g/kg given daily for two to five days.  \n \nThe treatment can be repeated if relapse occurs. \n \nGuillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome \n \n0.4 g/kg/day over 5 days (possible repeat of dosing in case of relapse). \n \nKawasaki disease \n \n2.0 g/kg should be administered as a single dose. Patients should receive concomitant treatment with \nacetylsalicylic acid. \n \nChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) \n \nStarting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 - 5 consecutive days. \nMaintenance doses: 1 g/kg over 1 - 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks. \nThe treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after \n6 months, the treatment should be discontinued. \nIf the treatment is effective long term treatment should be subject to the physicians discretion based \nupon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted \naccording to the individual course of the disease. \n \nMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) \n \nStarting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 - 5 consecutive days. \nMaintenance dose: 1 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4 to 8 weeks. \nThe treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after \n6 months, the treatment should be discontinued. \nIf the treatment is effective long term treatment should be subject to the physicians discretion based \nupon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted \naccording to the individual course of the disease. \n \nThe dose recommendations are summarised in the following table: \n\n \nIndication Dose Frequency of injections \n\nReplacement therapy:   \nPrimary immunodeficiency syndromes \n \n \n \n \n \n\nStarting dose: \n0.4 - 0.8 g/kg \n \nMaintenance \ndose: \n0.2 - 0.8 g/kg \n\n \n \n \n \n \nevery 3 - 4 weeks  \n\nSecondary immunodeficiencies (as defined \nin 4.1) \n\n0.2 - 0.4 g/kg \n \n\nevery 3 - 4 weeks  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 5 - \n \n\nImmunomodulation:   \nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia  \n \n \n \n \n\n0.8 - 1 g/kg \n \nor \n\n \n0.4 g/kg/d \n\non day 1, possibly repeated once \nwithin 3 days \n \n \nfor 2 - 5 days \n\nGuillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome 0.4 g/kg/d for 5 days \nKawasaki disease 2 g/kg in one dose in association with \n\nacetylsalicylic acid \nChronic inflammatory demyelinating \npolyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) \n\nStarting dose: \n2 g/kg \n \nMaintenance dose: \n1 g/kg \n\n \nin divided doses over 2 - 5 days \n \n \nevery 3 weeks over 1 - 2 days \n\nMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) Starting dose: \n2 g/kg \n \n \nMaintenance dose: \n1 g/kg \n \nor \n \n2 g/kg \n\n \nin divided doses over \n2 - 5 consecutive days \n \n \nevery 2 - 4 weeks \n \n \n \nevery 4 - 8 weeks in divided doses \nover 2 - 5 days \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nFlebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml is contraindicated in children aged 0 to 2 years (see section 4.3). \n \nThe posology in children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) is not different to that of adults as the \nposology for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the \nabove mentioned conditions. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo evidence is available to require a dose adjustment. \n  \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section  4.4. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor intravenous use. \nFlebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of \n0.01 - 0.02 ml/kg/min for the first thirty minutes. See section 4.4. In case of adverse reaction, either \nthe rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped. If well tolerated, the rate of \nadministration may gradually be increased to a maximum of 0.1 ml/kg/min.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 6 - \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance (human immunoglobulins) or to any of the excipients (see \nsections 4.4 and 6.1). \n \nFructose intolerance (see section 4.4).  \nIn babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) may not yet be \ndiagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this medicinal product. \n \nPatients with selective IgA deficiency who developed antibodies to IgA, as administering an \nIgA-containing product can result in anaphylaxis. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSorbitol \n \nEach ml of this medicinal product contains 50 mg of sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of fructose intolerance must not take this medicine.  \nIn persons more than 2 years old with HFI, a spontaneous aversion for fructose-containing \nfoods develops and may be combined with the onset of symptoms (vomiting, gastro-intestinal \ndisorders, apathy, height and weight retardation). Therefore a detailed history with regard to \nHFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to receiving Flebogamma DIF.  \nIn case of inadvertent administration and suspicion of fructose intolerance the infusion has to \nbe stopped immediately, normal glycaemia has to be re-established and organ function has to be \nstabilized by means of intensive care.  \n \nInterferences with determination of blood glucose levels are not expected. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nPrecautions for use \nPotential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients: \n- are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin by initially injecting the product slowly (at \n\nan initial rate of 0.01 - 0.02 ml/kg/min) \n- are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients \n\nnaive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative IVIg product or \nwhen there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored at the \nhospital during the first infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect \npotential adverse signs. All other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after \nadministration \n\n \nIn all patients, IVIg administration requires: \n- adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the infusion of IVIg \n- monitoring of urine output \n- monitoring of serum creatinine levels \n- avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics (see 4.5) \n \nIn case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped.  \nThe treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 7 - \n \n\nInfusion reaction \n \nCertain adverse reactions (e.g. headache, flushing, chills, myalgia, wheezing, tachycardia, lower back \npain, nausea, and hypotension) may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended infusion rate \ngiven under section 4.2 must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and carefully \nobserved for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. \n \nAdverse reactions may occur more frequently \n- in patients who receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when \n\nthe human normal immunoglobulin product is switched or when there has been a long interval \nsince the previous infusion \n\n- in patients with an untreated infection or underlying chronic inflammation \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions are rare.  \n \nAnaphylaxis can develop in patients \n- with undetectable IgA who have anti-IgA antibodies \n- who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin \n\n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nThromboembolism \n \nThere is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events \nsuch as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident (including stroke), pulmonary embolism and \ndeep vein thromboses which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through \nthe high influx of immunoglobulin in at-risk patients. Caution should be exercised in prescribing and \ninfusing IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events \n(such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic \nepisodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods \nof immobilisation, severely hypovolaemic patients, and patients with diseases which increase blood \nviscosity).  \n \nIn patients at risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the \nminimum rate of infusion and dose practicable. \n \nAcute renal failure \n \nCases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiving IVIg therapy. In most cases, risk \nfactors have been identified, such as pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypovolaemia, \noverweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age over 65. \n \nRenal parameters should be assessed prior to infusion of IVIg, particularly in patients judged to have a \npotential increased risk for developing acute renal failure, and again at appropriate intervals. In \npatients at risk for acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of \ninfusion and dose practicable. In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered.  \n \nWhile reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many \nof the licensed IVIg products containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and maltose, \nthose containing sucrose as a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. In \npatients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not contain these excipients may be considered. \nFlebogamma DIF does not contain sucrose, maltose or glucose. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 8 - \n \n\n \nAseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) \n \nAseptic meningitis syndrome has been reported to occur in association with IVIg treatment. The \nsyndrome usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IVIg treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid \nstudies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm3, predominantly \nfrom the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dl. AMS may occur \nmore frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment.  \n \nPatients exhibiting such signs and symptoms should receive a thorough neurological \nexamination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. \n \nDiscontinuation of IVIg treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without \nsequelae. \n \nHaemolytic anaemia \n \nIVIg products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as haemolysins and induce in vivo \ncoating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction \n(Coombs\u2019 test) and, rarely, haemolysis. Haemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy \ndue to enhanced red blood cells (RBC) sequestration. IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical \nsigns and symptoms of haemolysis. (See section 4.8.) \n \nNeutropenia/Leukopenia \n \nA transient decrease in neutrophil count and/or episodes of neutropenia, sometimes severe, have been \nreported after treatment with IVIgs. This typically occurs within hours or days after IVIg \nadministration and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 14 days. \n \nTransfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) \n \nIn patients receiving IVIg, there have been some reports of acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema \n[Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)]. TRALI is characterised by severe hypoxia, \ndyspnoea, tachypnoea, cyanosis, fever and hypotension. Symptoms of TRALI typically develop during \nor within 6 hours of a transfusion, often within 1 - 2 hours. Therefore, IVIg recipients must be \nmonitored for and IVIg infusion must be immediately stopped in case of pulmonary adverse reactions. \nTRALI is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate intensive-care-unit management. \n \nInterference with serological testing \n \nAfter the administration of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred \nantibodies in the patient\u2019s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. \n \nPassive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D may interfere with some \nserological tests for red cell antibodies for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct Coombs\u2019 \ntest). \n \nTransmissible agents \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 9 - \n \n\nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.  \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped \nhepatitis A and parvovirus B19 viruses. \n \nThere is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 \ntransmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an \nimportant contribution to viral safety. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Flebogamma DIF is administered to a patient, the \nname and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient \nand the batch of the product. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial of 10 ml, 50 ml, 100 ml \nand 200 ml, that is to say essentially \u201csodium free\u201d. This medicinal product contains less than \n29,41 mg sodium per vial of 400 ml, equivalent to 1.5% of the WHO recommended maximum daily \nintake of 2 g sodium for an adult. However, depending on the required dose, the patient may receive \nmore than 1 vial. \n \nPaediatric population \nIt is recommended to monitor vital signs when administering Flebogamma DIF to paediatric patients. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLive attenuated virus vaccines \n \nImmunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the \nefficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After \nadministration of this product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with live \nattenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. \nTherefore patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked. \n \nLoop diuretics \nAvoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIt is expected that the same interactions than those mentioned for the adults may be presented by the \npaediatric population. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThe safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in \ncontrolled clinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to pregnant women and \nbreast-feeding mothers. IVIg products have been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the \nthird trimester. Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the \ncourse of pregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 10 - \n \n\nBreast-feeding \nImmunoglobulins are excreted into human milk. No negative effects on the breastfed \nnewborns/infants are anticipated.  \n \nFertility \nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be \nexpected. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions, such as \ndizziness, associated with Flebogamma DIF. Patients who experience adverse reactions during \ntreatment should wait for these to resolve before driving or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions caused by human normal immunoglobulins (in decreasing frequency) encompass \n(see also section 4.4): \n \n\u2022 chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood \n\npressure and moderate low back pain \n\u2022 reversible haemolytic reactions; especially in those patients with blood groups A, B, and AB \n\nand (rarely) haemolytic anaemia requiring transfusion \n\u2022 (rarely) a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock, even when the \n\npatient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration \n\u2022 (rarely) transient cutaneous reactions (including cutaneous lupus erythematosus - frequency \n\nunknown) \n\u2022 (very rarely) thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary \n\nembolism, deep vein thromboses \n\u2022 cases of reversible aseptic meningitis \n\u2022 cases of increased serum creatinine level and/or occurrence of acute renal failure \n\u2022 cases of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) \n \nFor safety information with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: \n\n \n- very common (>1/10) \n- common (>1/100 to <1/10) \n- uncommon (>1/1,000 to <1/100) \n- rare (>1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \n- very rare (<1/10,000)  \n- not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 11 - \n \n\nSource of the safety database from clinical trials and post-authorisation safety studies in a total \nof 128 patients exposed to Flebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml (with a total of 1318 infusions) \n \n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClass (SOC) Adverse reaction \n\nFrequency \nper \n\npatient \n\nFrequency \nper \n\ninfusion \nInfections and infestations Nasopharyngitis Uncommon Uncommon \nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Uncommon Rare \nPsychiatric disorders Abnormal behaviour Uncommon Rare \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache Very Common Common \nDizziness Common Uncommon \nMigraine Uncommon Rare \n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia Common Common Cardiovascular disorder Uncommon Rare \n\nVascular disorders \n\nDiastolic hypotension, Hypotension \nCommon \n\nCommon \nDiastolic hypertension, \nHypertension Uncommon \nSystolic hypertension Uncommon Blood pressure fluctuation, Flushing Rare \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nBronchitis, Wheezing Common Uncommon \nProductive cough \n\nUncommon \n\nUncommon \nAsthma, Cough, Dyspnoea, \nEpistaxis, Nasal discomfort, \nLaryngeal pain \n\nRare \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain upper, Abdominal pain, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting Common Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUrticaria  Common Uncommon Pruritus, Rash pruritic \nUncommon Dermatitis contact, Hyperhidrosis, \n\nRash Rare \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nBack pain, Arthralgia, Myalgia Common Uncommon \nMuscle spasms, Neck pain, Pain in \nextremity Uncommon Rare \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Urinary retention Uncommon Rare \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nPyrexia Very Common Common \nChills, Injection site reaction, Pain, \nRigors Common Uncommon \n\nAsthenia, Chest pain, Infusion site \nerythema, Infusion site \nextravasation, Infusion site \ninflammation, Infusion site pain, \nInjection site oedema, Injection site \npain, Injection site pruritus, \nInjection site swelling, Oedema \nperipheral \n\nUncommon Rare \n\nInvestigations \n\nBlood pressure systolic increased, \nBody temperature increased, \nCoombs test positive \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nBlood pressure systolic decreased \nUncommon \n\nUncommon \nAlanine aminotransferase increased, \nBlood pressure increased Rare \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications Infusion related reaction Uncommon Uncommon \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 12 - \n \n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClass (SOC) Adverse reaction \n\nFrequency \nper \n\npatient \n\nFrequency \nper \n\ninfusion \nProduct issues Device dislocation Uncommon Rare \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n\n \nThe most reported post-marketing ADRs received since the product was authorised for both \nconcentrations were chest pain, flushing, blood pressure increased and decreased, malaise, dyspnoea, \nnausea, vomiting, pyrexia, back pain, headache and chills.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety results for 29 paediatric patients (those \u2264 17 years old) included in the PID studies were \nevaluated. It was observed that the proportion of headache, pyrexia, tachycardia and hypotension in \nchildren was higher than in adults. Assessment of vital signs in clinical trials of the paediatric \npopulation did not indicate any pattern of clinically relevant changes.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity, particularly in patients at risk, including \nelderly patients or patients with cardiac or renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInformation on overdose in children has not been established with Flebogamma DIF. However, as in \nadult population, overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity as with any other \nintravenous immunoglobulins.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, \nfor intravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA02. \n \nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of \nantibodies against infectious agents. \n \nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is \nusually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1000 donors. It has a distribution of \nimmunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma.  \n \nAdequate doses of this medicinal product may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the \nnormal range.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 13 - \n \n\nThe mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but \nincludes immunomodulatory effects. A significant increase in median platelet levels was achieved in a \nclinical trial in chronic ITP patients (64,000/\u00b5l) although it did not reach normal levels. \n \nThree clinical trials were performed with Flebogamma DIF, two for replacement therapy in patients \nwith primary immunodeficiency (one in both adults and in children above 10 years and another in \nchildren between 2 to 16 years) and another for immunomodulation in adult patients with immune \nthrombocytopenic purpura. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nHuman normal immunoglobulin is immediately and completely bioavailable in the recipient\u2019s \ncirculation after intravenous administration. It is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and \nextravascular fluid, after approximately 3 - 5 days equilibrium is reached between the intra- and \nextravascular compartments. \n \nFlebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml has a half-life of about 30 - 32 days. This half-life may vary from patient \nto patient, in particular in primary immunodeficiency. \n \nIgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo differences of the pharmacokinetic properties are expected in the paediatric population. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle dose toxicity studies were carried out in rats and mice. The absence of mortality in the \nnon-clinical studies performed with Flebogamma DIF with doses up to 2500 mg/kg, and the lack of \nany confirmed relevant adverse sign affecting respiratory, circulatory and central nervous system of \nthe treated animals support the safety of Flebogamma DIF. \n \nRepeated dose toxicity testing and embryo-foetal toxicity studies are impracticable due to induction \nof, and interference with antibodies. Effects of the product on the immune system of the newborn \nhave not been studied. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReplacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) in: \n \n- Primary immunodeficiency syndromes (PID) with impaired antibody production \n- Secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent infections, \n\nineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF)* or \nserum IgG level of <4 g/l \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 16 - \n \n\n* PSAF= failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide \nand polypeptide antigen vaccines \n \nImmunomodulation in adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) in: \n \n- Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), in patients at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery \n\nto correct the platelet count \n \n- Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome \n \n- Kawasaki disease (in conjunction with acetylsalicylic acid; see 4.2) \n\n \n- Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) \n\n \n- Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nReplacement therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose and dose regimen is dependent on the indication. \n \nThe dose may need to be individualised for each patient dependent on the clinical response. Dose \nbased on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. The following \ndose regimens are given as a guideline. \n \nReplacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes \n \nThe dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG (measured before the next infusion) of at least \n6 g/l or within the normal reference range for the population age. Three to six months are required \nafter the initiation of therapy for equilibration (steady-state IgG levels) to occur. The recommended \nstarting dose is 0.4 - 0.8 g/kg given once followed by at least 0.2 g/kg given every three to four weeks. \n \nThe dose required to achieve a trough level of IgG of 6 g/l is of the order of 0.2 - 0.8 g/kg/month. The \ndose interval when steady state has been reached varies from 3 - 4 weeks. \n \nIgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. To \nreduce the rate of bacterial infections, it may be necessary to increase the dosage and aim for higher \ntrough levels. \n \nSecondary immunodeficiencies (as defined in 4.1) \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.2 - 0.4 g/kg every three to four weeks. \n \nIgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. \nDose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an increase \nmay be necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when the \npatient remains infection free. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 17 - \n \n\nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia \n \nThere are two alternative treatment schedules: \n\u2022 0.8 - 1 g/kg given on day one; this dose may be repeated once within 3 days. \n\u2022 0.4 g/kg given daily for two to five days.  \n \nThe treatment can be repeated if relapse occurs. \n \nGuillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome \n \n0.4 g/kg/day over 5 days (possible repeat of dosing in case of relapse). \n \nKawasaki disease \n \n2.0 g/kg should be administered as a single dose. Patients should receive concomitant treatment with \nacetylsalicylic acid. \n \nChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) \n \nStarting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 - 5 consecutive days. \nMaintenance doses: 1 g/kg over 1 - 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks. \nThe treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after \n6 months, the treatment should be discontinued. \nIf the treatment is effective long term treatment should be subject to the physicians discretion based \nupon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be \nadapted according to the individual course of the disease. \n \nMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) \n \nStarting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 - 5 consecutive days. \nMaintenance dose: 1 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4 to 8 weeks. \nThe treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after \n6 months, the treatment should be discontinued. \nIf the treatment is effective long term treatment should be subject to the physicians discretion based \nupon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be \nadapted according to the individual course of the disease. \n \nThe dose recommendations are summarised in the following table: \n\n \nIndication Dose Frequency of injections \n\nReplacement therapy:   \nPrimary immunodeficiency syndromes \n \n \n \n \n \n\nStarting dose: \n0.4 - 0.8 g/kg \n \nMaintenance \ndose: \n0.2 - 0.8 g/kg \n\n \n \n \n \n \nevery 3 - 4 weeks  \n\nSecondary immunodeficiencies (as defined in \n4.1) \n\n0.2 - 0.4 g/kg \n \n\nevery 3 - 4 weeks \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 18 - \n \n\nImmunomodulation:   \nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia \n \n \n \n \n\n0.8 - 1 g/kg \n \nor \n\n \n0.4 g/kg/d \n\non day 1, possibly repeated once \nwithin 3 days \n \n \nfor 2 - 5 days \n\nGuillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome 0.4 g/kg/d for 5 days \n\nKawasaki disease 2 g/kg in one dose in association with \nacetylsalicylic acid \n\nChronic inflammatory demyelinating \npolyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) \n\nStarting dose: \n2 g/kg \n \nMaintenance \ndose: \n1 g/kg \n\n \nin divided doses over 2 - 5 days \n \n \n \nevery 3 weeks over 1 - 2 days \n\nMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) Starting dose: \n2 g/kg \n \n \nMaintenance \ndose: \n1 g/kg \n \nor \n \n2 g/kg \n\n \nin divided doses over \n2 - 5 consecutive days \n \n \n \nevery 2 - 4 weeks \n \n \n \nevery 4 - 8 weeks in divided doses \nover 2 - 5 days \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nFlebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml is contraindicated in children aged 0 to 2 years (see section 4.3). \n \nThe posology in children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) is not different to that of adults as the \nposology for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the \nabove mentioned conditions. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo evidence is available to require a dose adjustment. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor intravenous use. \nFlebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.01 ml/kg/min for \nthe first thirty minutes. See section 4.4. In case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration \nmust be reduced or the infusion stopped. If well tolerated, advance to 0.02 ml/kg/min for the second \n30 minutes. Again, if tolerated, advance to 0.04 ml/kg/min for the third 30 minutes. If the patient \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 19 - \n \n\ntolerates the infusion well, additional increments of 0.02 ml/kg/min may be made at 30-minute \nintervals up to a maximum of 0.08 ml/kg/min.  \n \nIt has been reported that the frequency of adverse reactions to IVIg increases with the infusion rate. \nInfusion rates during the initial infusions should be slow. If there are no adverse reactions, the \ninfusion rate for subsequent infusions can be slowly increased to the maximum rate. For patients \nexperiencing adverse reactions, it is advisable to reduce the infusion rate in subsequent infusions and \nlimit the maximum rate to 0.04 ml/kg/min or administer IVIg at a 5% concentration (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance (human immunoglobulins) or to any of the excipients (see \nsections 4.4 and 6.1). \n \nFructose intolerance (see section 4.4).  \nIn babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) may not yet be \ndiagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this medicinal product. \n \nPatients with selective IgA deficiency who developed antibodies to IgA, as administering an \nIgA-containing product can result in anaphylaxis. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSorbitol \n \nEach ml of this medicinal product contains 50 mg of sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of fructose intolerance must not take this medicine.  \nIn persons more than 2 years old with HFI, a spontaneous aversion for fructose-containing \nfoods develops and may be combined with the onset of symptoms (vomiting, gastro-intestinal \ndisorders, apathy, height and weight retardation). Therefore a detailed history with regard to \nHFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to receiving Flebogamma DIF.  \nIn case of inadvertent administration and suspicion of fructose intolerance the infusion has to \nbe stopped immediately, normal glycaemia has to be re-established and organ function has to be \nstabilized by means of intensive care.  \n \nInterferences with determination of blood glucose levels are not expected.  \n\n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nPrecautions for use \nPotential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients: \n- are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin by initially injecting the product slowly (at \n\nan initial rate of 0.01 ml/kg/min) \n- are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients \n\nnaive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative IVIg product or \nwhen there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored at the \nhospital during the first infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect \npotential adverse signs. All other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after \nadministration \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 20 - \n \n\nIn all patients, IVIg administration requires: \n- adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the infusion of IVIg \n- monitoring of urine output \n- monitoring of serum creatinine levels \n- avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics (see 4.5) \n \nIn case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped. \nThe treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction. \n \nInfusion reaction \n \nCertain adverse reactions (e.g. headache, flushing, chills, myalgia, wheezing, tachycardia, lower back \npain, nausea, and hypotension) may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended infusion rate \ngiven under section 4.2 must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and carefully \nobserved for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. \n \nAdverse reactions may occur more frequently \n- in patients who receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when \n\nthe human normal immunoglobulin product is switched or when there has been a long interval \nsince the previous infusion \n\n- in patients with an untreated infection or underlying chronic inflammation \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions are rare.  \n \nAnaphylaxis can develop in patients \n- with undetectable IgA who have anti-IgA antibodies \n- who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nThromboembolism \n \nThere is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events \nsuch as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident (including stroke), pulmonary embolism and \ndeep vein thromboses which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through \nthe high influx of immunoglobulin in at-risk patients. Caution should be exercised in prescribing and \ninfusing IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events \n(such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic \nepisodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods \nof immobilisation, severely hypovolaemic patients, and patients with diseases which increase blood \nviscosity).  \n \nIn patients at risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the \nminimum rate of infusion and dose practicable. \n \nAcute renal failure \n \nCases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiving IVIg therapy. In most cases, risk \nfactors have been identified, such as pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypovolaemia, \noverweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age over 65. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 21 - \n \n\nRenal parameters should be assessed prior to infusion of IVIg, particularly in patients judged to have a \npotential increased risk for developing acute renal failure, and again at appropriate intervals. In \npatients at risk for acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of \ninfusion and dose practicable. In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered. \n \nWhile reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many \nof the licensed IVIg products containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and maltose, \nthose containing sucrose as a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. In \npatients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not contain these excipients may be considered. \nFlebogamma DIF does not contain sucrose, maltose or glucose. \n \nAseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) \n \nAseptic meningitis syndrome has been reported to occur in association with IVIg treatment. The \nsyndrome usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IVIg treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid \nstudies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm3, predominantly \nfrom the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dl. AMS may occur \nmore frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment. \n \nPatients exhibiting such signs and symptoms should receive a thorough neurological \nexamination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. \n \nDiscontinuation of IVIg treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without \nsequelae. \n \nHaemolytic anaemia \n \nIVIg products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as haemolysins and induce in vivo \ncoating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction \n(Coomb\u2019s test) and, rarely, haemolysis. Haemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy \ndue to enhanced red blood cells (RBC) sequestration. IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical \nsigns and symptoms of haemolysis. (See section 4.8) \n \nNeutropenia/Leukopenia \n \nA transient decrease in neutrophil count and/or episodes of neutropenia, sometimes severe, have been \nreported after treatment with IVIgs. This typically occurs within hours or days after IVIg \nadministration and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 14 days. \n \nTransfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) \n \nIn patients receiving IVIg, there have been some reports of acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema \n[Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)]. TRALI is characterised by severe hypoxia, \ndyspnoea, tachypnoea, cyanosis, fever and hypotension. Symptoms of TRALI typically develop \nduring or within 6 hours of a transfusion, often within 1 - 2 hours. Therefore, IVIg recipients must be \nmonitored for and IVIg infusion must be immediately stopped in case of pulmonary adverse reactions. \nTRALI is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate intensive-care-unit \nmanagement. \n \nInterference with serological testing \n \nAfter the administration of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred \nantibodies in the patient\u2019s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 22 - \n \n\n \nPassive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D, may interfere with some \nserological tests for red cell antibodies for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct Coomb\u2019s \ntest). \n \nTransmissible agents \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.  \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped \nhepatitis A and parvovirus B19 viruses. \n \nThere is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 \ntransmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an \nimportant contribution to viral safety. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Flebogamma DIF is administered to a patient, the \nname and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient \nand the batch of the product. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium free\u201d. However, depending on the required dose, the patient may receive more than 1 vial. \n \nPost-authorisation Safety Study  \n \nA Post-Authorisation Safety Study suggested a higher rate of infusions associated with potentially \nrelated adverse events for Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml compared to Flebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nIt is recommended to monitor vital signs when administering Flebogamma DIF to paediatric patients. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLive attenuated virus vaccines \n \nImmunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the \nefficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After \nadministration of this product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with live \nattenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. \nTherefore patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked. \n \nLoop diuretics \nAvoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 23 - \n \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nIt is expected that the same interactions than those mentioned for the adults may be presented by the \npaediatric population. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThe safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in \ncontrolled clinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to pregnant women and \nbreast-feeding mothers. IVIg products have been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the \nthird trimester. Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the \ncourse of pregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected. \n \nBreast-feeding \nImmunoglobulins are excreted into human milk. No negative effects on the breastfed \nnewborns/infants are anticipated.  \n \nFertility \nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be \nexpected. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions, such as \ndizziness, associated with Flebogamma DIF. Patients who experience adverse reactions during \ntreatment should wait for these to resolve before driving or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nAdverse reactions caused by human normal immunoglobulins (in decreasing frequency) encompass \n(see also section 4.4): \n \n\u2022 chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood \n\npressure and moderate low back pain \n\u2022 reversible haemolytic reactions; especially in those patients with blood groups A, B, and AB \n\nand (rarely) haemolytic anaemia requiring transfusion \n\u2022 (rarely) a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock, even when the \n\npatient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration \n\u2022 (rarely) transient cutaneous reactions (including cutaneous lupus erythematosus - frequency \n\nunknown) \n\u2022 (very rarely) thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary \n\nembolism, deep vein thromboses \n\u2022 cases of reversible aseptic meningitis \n\u2022 cases of increased serum creatinine level and/or occurrence of acute renal failure \n\u2022 cases of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) \n \nFor safety information with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n -

Cyanosis was reported in one child but \nnot in adults. Assessment of vital signs in clinical trials of the paediatric population did not indicate \nany pattern of clinically relevant changes. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 26 - \n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity, particularly in patients at risk, including \nelderly patients or patients with cardiac or renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInformation on overdose in children has not been established with Flebogamma DIF. However, as in \nadult population, overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity as with any other \nintravenous immunoglobulins.  \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, \nfor intravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA02. \n \nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of \nantibodies against infectious agents. \n \nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is \nusually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1000 donors. It has a distribution of \nimmunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma.  \n \nAdequate doses of this medicinal product may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the \nnormal range.  \n \nThe mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but \nincludes immunomodulatory effects.  \n \nThree clinical trials were performed with Flebogamma DIF, one for replacement therapy in patients \nwith primary immunodeficiency (in both adults and in children above 6 years) and two for \nimmunomodulation, in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (one in adult patients and \nanother in both adults and in children between 3 and 16 years). \n \nIn a Post-authorisation Safety Study that included 66 patients, Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml showed a \nhigher rate (18.46%, n=24/130) of infusions associated with potentially related adverse events than \nFlebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml (2.22%, n=3/135). However one subject treated with Flebogamma DIF \n100 mg/ml presented mild episodes of headache in all infusions and one more patient had 2 episodes \nof pyrexia in 2 infusions. It is worth considering that these 2 subjects contributed to the higher \nfrequency of infusions with reactions in this group. There were no other subjects with more than \n1 infusion with adverse reactions in both groups. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 27 - \n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nHuman normal immunoglobulin is immediately and completely bioavailable in the recipient\u2019s \ncirculation after intravenous administration. It is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and \nextravascular fluid, after approximately 3 - 5 days equilibrium is reached between the intra- and \nextravascular compartments. \n \nFlebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml has a half-life of about 34 - 37 days. This half-life may vary from patient \nto patient, in particular in primary immunodeficiency. \n \nIgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo differences of the pharmacokinetic properties are expected in the paediatric population. \n  \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle dose toxicity studies were carried out in rats and mice. The absence of mortality in the \nnon-clinical studies performed with Flebogamma DIF with doses up to 2500 mg/kg, and the lack of \nany confirmed relevant adverse sign affecting respiratory, circulatory and central nervous system of \nthe treated animals support the safety of Flebogamma DIF. \n \nRepeated dose toxicity testing and embryo-foetal toxicity studies are impracticable due to induction \nof, and interference with antibodies. Effects of the product on the immune system of the newborn \nhave not been studied. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Flebogamma DIF is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Flebogamma DIF  \n3. How to use Flebogamma DIF \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Flebogamma DIF \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Flebogamma DIF is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Flebogamma DIF is \n \nFlebogamma DIF contains human normal immunoglobulin, highly purified protein extracted from \nhuman plasma (part of the blood of donors). This medicine belongs to the group of medicines called \nintravenous immunoglobulins. These are used to treat conditions where the body\u2019s defence system \nagainst disease is not working properly. \n \nWhat Flebogamma DIF is used for \n \nTreatment of adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) who do not have sufficient antibodies \n(Flebogamma DIF is used as replacement therapy). There are two groups: \n \n\u2022 Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency Syndromes (PID), an inborn lack of antibodies \n\n(group 1) \n \n\n\u2022 Patients with Secondary Immunodeficiency Syndromes (SID) with severe or recurrent \ninfections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure \n(PSAF)* or serum IgG level of <4 g/l (group 2)  \n\n \n*PSAF= failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide \nand polypeptide antigen vaccines. \n \nTreatment of adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) with certain autoimmune disorders \n(immunomodulation). There are five groups: \n \n\u2022 Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition where the number of platelets in the \n\nblood stream is greatly reduced. Platelets form an important part of the clotting process and a \nreduction in their numbers may cause unwanted bleeding and bruising.

What you need to know before you use Flebogamma DIF  \n \nDo not use Flebogamma DIF  \n \n- If you are allergic to human normal immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \n- If you do not have enough immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your blood or have developed \n\nantibodies to IgA. \n \n- If you have fructose intolerance, a quite rare genetic condition where the enzyme for breaking \n\ndown fructose is not produced. In babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary \nfructose intolerance may not yet be diagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this \nmedicine (see special warnings about excipients at the end of this section). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Flebogamma DIF. \n \nCertain side effects may occur more frequently: \n\u2022 in case of high rate of infusion. \n\u2022 if you are having Flebogamma DIF for the first time, or it has been switched from an alternative \n\nhuman normal immunoglobulin (IVIg) product, or it is a long time since your last infusion (e.g. \nseveral weeks). You will be watched carefully until an hour after the infusion to detect potential \nside effects. \n\n \nAllergic reactions are rare. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough immunoglobulins of \nthe type IgA in your blood or have developed antibodies to IgA. \n \nPatients with pre-existing risk factors \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you have any other condition and/or illness, as control is required in patients \nwith pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events (formation of blood clots inside your blood). In \nparticular, tell your doctor if you have: \n\u2022 diabetes \n\u2022 high blood pressure \n\u2022 history of vascular disease or thrombosis \n\u2022 overweight  \n\u2022 blood volume decrease \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 52 - \n \n\n\u2022 diseases which increase blood viscosity \n\u2022 age over 65 \n \nPatients with a kidney problem \n \nIf you have a renal disease and you are receiving Flebogamma DIF for the first time, you may suffer a \nproblem in your kidneys. \n \nYour doctor will consider your risk factors and take measures such as to decrease the rate of infusion \nor to stop the treatment. \n \nEffects on blood tests \n \nAfter receiving Flebogamma DIF, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be \ninterfered for a certain time. If you have a blood test after receiving Flebogamma DIF, please tell the \nanalyst or your doctor that you have been given this medicine.  \n \nSpecial safety warning \n \nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent \ninfections being passed on to patients. These include: \n \n\u2022 careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \n\nare excluded, \n \n\n\u2022 the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections, \n \n\u2022 the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove \n\nviruses.  \n \n\nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This applies to any unknown or \nemerging viruses or other types of infections.  \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A and \nparvovirus B19 viruses. \n \nImmunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections possibly \nbecause the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Flebogamma DIF, the name and \nbatch number of the medicine (stated on the label and carton after Lot) are recorded in order to \nmaintain a record of the batches used. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nVital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate) should be observed \nduring the infusion of Flebogamma DIF. \n \nOther medicines and Flebogamma DIF \n \n\uf097 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 53 - \n \n\n\u2022 Effects on vaccines: Flebogamma DIF may reduce the effectiveness of certain types of vaccines \n(live attenuated virus vaccines). In case of rubella, mumps and varicella a period of up to \n3 months should elapse after receiving this medicine and before receiving these vaccines. In \ncase of measles, the period is up to 1 year. \n\n \n\uf097 You should avoid the concomitant use of medicines that increase the excretion of water from \n\nyour body (loop diuretics) during treatment with Flebogamma DIF. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nPatients may experience reactions (for example dizziness or nausea) during treatment, which might \naffect the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nFlebogamma DIF contains sorbitol \n \nThis medicine contains 50 mg of sorbitol per ml. If you have been told by your doctor that you have \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.   \nIn persons more than 2 years old with problems to tolerate fructose, a spontaneous reaction for \nfructose-containing foods develops which may have the following symptoms: vomiting, \ngastro-intestinal disorders, apathy, height and weight retardation. Therefore, patients should be \nexamined for the symptoms of Hereditary Fructose Intolerance prior to receiving \nFlebogamma DIF. \n \nFlebogamma DIF contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial of 10 ml, 50 ml, 100 ml and 200 ml, \nthat is to say essentially \u201csodium free\u201d. This medicine contains less than 29,41 mg sodium (main \ncomponent of cooking/table salt) in each vial of 400 ml. This is equivalent to 1.5% of the \nrecommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. However, depending on the \nrequired dose, the patient may receive more than 1 vial. \n \n \n3. How to use Flebogamma DIF \n \nFlebogamma DIF is given by injection into your veins (intravenous administration). It may be \nself-administered if you have been fully trained by hospital staff. You must make up the infusion in \nexactly the way you have been shown in order to stop germs getting in. You must never \nself-administer it alone; a responsible adult must be always present. \n \nThe dose that you will be given will depend on your illness and body weight and will be worked out \nby your doctor (please see section \u201cInstructions for healthcare professionals\u201d given at the end of this \nleaflet). \n \nAt the beginning of your infusion you will receive Flebogamma DIF at a slow rate \n(0.01 - 0.02 ml/kg/min). Depending on how comfortable you feel, your doctor may then gradually \nincrease the infusion rate (up to 0.1 ml/kg/min). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 54 - \n \n\nUse in children of more than 2 years old \n \nThe dose in children is not considered to be different to that of adults as it will be given depending on \nthe illness and body weight of the children. \n \nIf you use more Flebogamma DIF than you should \n\n \nIf you get more Flebogamma DIF than you should, your body may take on too much fluid. This could \nparticularly happen when you are a patient at risk, e.g. an elderly patient or a patient having problems \nwith your heart or your kidneys. Tell your doctor immediately.  \n \nIf you forget to use Flebogamma DIF  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist immediately and follow his/her instructions. \nYou must not be given a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIn rare and isolated cases, the following side effects have been reported with immunoglobulin \npreparations. Seek medical care with no delay if any of the following side effects happen during \nor after the infusion: \n\u2022 A sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock (which signs are rash, \n\nhypotension, palpitation, wheezing, coughing, sneezing and difficulty breathing among others), \neven if you have shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration. \n\n\u2022 Cases of temporary non-infective meningitis (which signs are headache, fear or intolerance of \nlight, stiff neck). \n\n\u2022 Cases of temporary reduction in the number of the red cells in the blood (reversible haemolytic \nanaemia/haemolysis). \n\n\u2022 Cases of transient cutaneous reactions (side effects on your skin). \n\u2022 Increase in serum creatinine level (a test which measures your kidney function) and/or acute \n\nrenal failure (which signs are low back pain, fatigue, decrease in the amount of urine). \n\u2022 Thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction (tight band around the chest with \n\nfeeling like your heart is beating too fast), stroke (muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg, \ntrouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking), pulmonary embolism (shortness of \nbreath, chest pain and fatigue), deep vein thromboses (pain and swelling in an extremity). \n\n\u2022 Cases of transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) that causes hypoxia (lack of oxygen), \ndyspnoea (difficulty in breathing), tachypnoea (rapid breathing), cyanosis (lack of oxygen in \nthe blood), fever and hypotension. \n\n \nOther side effects  \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 infusions): \n\u25cf headache \n\u25cf fever (body temperature increased) \n\u25cf tachycardia (acceleration of the heart activity) \n\u25cf hypotension \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 55 - \n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 infusions): \n\u25cf bronchitis \n\u2022 nasopharyngitis \n\u2022 dizziness (motion sickness) \n\u2022 hypertension \n\u2022 blood pressure increased \n\u25cf wheezing \n\u2022 productive cough \n\u25cf abdominal pain (including abdominal pain upper)  \n\u25cf diarrhoea \n\u25cf vomiting \n\u25cf nausea \n\u25cf urticaria \n\u2022 pruritus (itching) \n\u2022 rash (eruption of the skin) \n\u25cf back pain \n\u25cf myalgia (muscle pain) \n\u25cf arthralgia (joint pain)  \n\u25cf rigors (cold shivering sensation) or chills \n\u25cf pain \n\u25cf injection site reaction \n\u25cf Coombs test positive \n\u2022 blood pressure decreased \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 infusions): \n\u2022 hypersensitivity \n\u2022 abnormal behaviour \n\u2022 migraine \n\u2022 blood pressure fluctuation \n\u2022 flushing (to blush) \n\u2022 cough \n\u2022 asthma \n\u2022 dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing) \n\u2022 epistaxis (haemorrhage from the nose) \n\u2022 nasal discomfort \n\u2022 laryngeal pain \n\u2022 dermatitis contact \n\u2022 hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) \n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 muscle spasms \n\u2022 neck pain \n\u2022 pain in extremity \n\u2022 urinary retention \n\u2022 asthenia (fatigue) \n\u2022 chest pain \n\u2022 infusion site reactions (erythema, extravasation, inflammation, pain) \n\u2022 injection site reactions (including injection site oedema, pain, pruritus and swelling) \n\u2022 oedema peripheral \n\u2022 alanine aminotransferase (hepatic transaminase) increased \n\u2022 device dislocation \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 56 - \n \n\nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents \n \nIt was observed that the proportion of headache, fever, heart rate increased and low blood pressure in \nchildren was higher than in adults. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Flebogamma DIF is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Flebogamma DIF is \n \nFlebogamma DIF contains human normal immunoglobulin, highly purified protein extracted from \nhuman plasma (part of the blood of donors). This medicine belongs to the group of medicines called \nintravenous immunoglobulins. These are used to treat conditions where the body\u2019s defence system \nagainst disease is not working properly. \n \nWhat Flebogamma DIF is used for \n \nTreatment of adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) who do not have sufficient antibodies \n(Flebogamma DIF is used as replacement therapy). There are two groups: \n \n\u2022 Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency Syndromes (PID), an inborn lack of antibodies \n\n(group 1) \n \n\n\u2022 Patients with Secondary Immunodeficiency Syndromes (SID) with severe or recurrent \ninfections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure \n(PSAF)* or serum IgG level of <4 g/l (group 2) \n\n \n*PSAF= failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide \nand polypeptide antigen vaccines. \n \nTreatment of adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) with certain autoimmune disorders \n(immunomodulation). There are five groups: \n \n\u2022 Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition where the number of platelets in the \n\nblood stream is greatly reduced. Platelets form an important part of the clotting process and a \nreduction in their numbers may cause unwanted bleeding and bruising. The product is also used \nin patients at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery to correct the platelet count.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 61 - \n \n\n \n\u2022 Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome, where the immune system damages the nerves and hinders them from \n\nworking properly. \n \n\u2022 Kawasaki disease (in this case in conjunction with acetylsalicylic acid therapy), an illness in \n\nchildren where the blood vessels (arteries) in the body become enlarged. \n \n\u2022 Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), a rare and progressive \n\ndisease causing limb weakness, numbness, pain and fatigue. \n  \n\n\u2022 Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), a rare disease causing slow progressive asymmetric limb \nweakness without sensory loss. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Flebogamma DIF  \n \nDo not use Flebogamma DIF  \n \n- If you are allergic to human normal immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \n\n- If you do not have enough immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your blood or have developed \nantibodies to IgA. \n\n \n- If you have fructose intolerance, a quite rare genetic condition where the enzyme for breaking \n\ndown fructose is not produced. In babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary \nfructose intolerance may not yet be diagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this \nmedicine (see special warnings about excipients at the end of this section). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Flebogamma DIF. \n \nCertain side effects may occur more frequently: \n\u2022 in case of high rate of infusion \n\u2022 if you are having Flebogamma DIF for the first time, or it has been switched from an alternative \n\nhuman normal immunoglobulin (IVIg) product, or it is a long time since your last infusion (e.g. \nseveral weeks). You will be watched carefully until an hour after the infusion to detect potential \nside effects. \n\n \nAllergic reactions are rare. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough immunoglobulins of \nthe type IgA in your blood or have developed antibodies to IgA.  \n \nPatients with pre-existing risk factors \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you have any other condition and/or illness, as control  is required in patients \nwith pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events (formation of blood clots inside your blood). In \nparticular, tell your doctor if you have: \n\u2022 diabetes \n\u2022 high blood pressure \n\u2022 history of vascular disease or thrombosis \n\u2022 overweight  \n\u2022 blood volume decrease \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 62 - \n \n\n\u2022 diseases which increase blood viscosity \n\u2022 age over 65 \n \nPatients with a kidney problem \n \nIf you have a renal disease and you are receiving Flebogamma DIF for the first time, you may suffer a \nproblem in your kidneys. \n \nYour doctor will consider your risk factors and take measures such as to decrease the rate of infusion \nor to stop the treatment. \n \nEffects on blood tests \n \nAfter receiving Flebogamma DIF, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be \ninterfered for a certain time. If you have a blood test after receiving Flebogamma DIF, please tell the \nanalyst or your doctor that you have been given this medicine. \n \nSpecial safety warning \n \nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent \ninfections being passed on to patients. These include: \n \n\u2022 careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \n\nare excluded, \n \n\n\u2022 the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections, \n \n\u2022 the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove \n\nviruses.  \n \n\nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This applies to any unknown or \nemerging viruses or other types of infections.  \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A and \nparvovirus B19 viruses. \n \nImmunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections possibly \nbecause the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Flebogamma DIF, the name and \nbatch number of the medicine (stated on the label and carton after Lot) are recorded in order to \nmaintain a record of the batches used. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nVital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate) should be observed \nduring the infusion of Flebogamma DIF. \n \nOther medicines and Flebogamma DIF \n \n\uf097 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 63 - \n \n\n\u2022 Effects on vaccines: Flebogamma DIF may reduce the effectiveness of certain types of vaccines \n(live attenuated virus vaccines). In case of rubella, mumps and varicella a period of up to \n3 months should elapse after receiving this medicine and before receiving these vaccines. In \ncase of measles, the period is up to 1 year. \n\n \n\uf097 You should avoid the concomitant use of medicines that increase the excretion of water from \n\nyour body (loop diuretics) during treatment with Flebogamma DIF. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nPatients may experience reactions (for example dizziness or nausea) during treatment, which might \naffect the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nFlebogamma DIF contains sorbitol \n \nThis medicine contains 50 mg of sorbitol per ml. If you have been told by your doctor that you have \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.   \nIn persons more than 2 years old with problems to tolerate fructose, a spontaneous reaction for \nfructose-containing foods develops which may have the following symptoms: vomiting, \ngastro-intestinal disorders, apathy, height and weight retardation. Therefore, patients should be \nexamined for the symptoms of Hereditary Fructose Intolerance prior to receiving \nFlebogamma DIF. \n \nFlebogamma DIF contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \u201csodium \nfree\u201d. However, depending on the required dose, the patient may receive more than 1 vial. \n \n \n3. How to use Flebogamma DIF \n \nFlebogamma DIF is given by injection into your veins (intravenous administration). It may be \nself-administered if you have been fully trained by hospital staff. You must make up the infusion in \nexactly the way you have been shown in order to stop germs getting in. You must never \nself-administer it alone; a responsible adult must be always present. \n \nThe dose that you will be given will depend on your illness and body weight and will be worked out \nby your doctor (please see section \u201cInstructions for healthcare professionals\u201d given at the end of this \nleaflet). \n \nAt the beginning of your infusion you will receive Flebogamma DIF at a slow rate (0.01 ml/kg/min). \nDepending on how comfortable you feel, your doctor may then gradually increase the infusion rate \n(up to 0.08 ml/kg/min). \n \nUse in children of more than 2 years old \n \nThe dose in children is not considered to be different to that of adults as it will be given depending on \nthe illness and body weight of the children. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 64 - \n \n\nIf you use more Flebogamma DIF than you should \n \n\nIf you get more Flebogamma DIF than you should, your body may take on too much fluid. This could \nparticularly happen when you are a patient at risk, e.g. an elderly patient or a patient having problems \nwith your heart or your kidneys. Tell your doctor immediately.  \n \nIf you forget to use Flebogamma DIF  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist immediately and follow his/her instructions. \nYou must not be given a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIn rare and isolated cases, the following side effects have been reported with immunoglobulin \npreparations. Seek medical care with no delay if any of the following side effects happen during \nor after the infusion: \n\u2022 A sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock (which signs are rash, \n\nhypotension, palpitation, wheezing, coughing, sneezing and difficulty breathing among others), \neven if you have shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration. \n\n\u2022 Cases of temporary non-infective meningitis (which signs are headache, fear or intolerance of \nlight, stiff neck). \n\n\u2022 Cases of temporary reduction in the number of the red cells in the blood (reversible haemolytic \nanaemia/haemolysis). \n\n\u2022 Cases of transient cutaneous reactions (side effects on your skin). \n\u2022 Increase in serum creatinine level (a test which measures your kidney function) and/or acute \n\nrenal failure (which signs are low back pain, fatigue, decrease in the amount of urine). \n\u2022 Thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction (tight band around the chest with \n\nfeeling like your heart is beating too fast), stroke (muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg, \ntrouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking), pulmonary embolism (shortness of \nbreath, chest pain and fatigue), deep vein thromboses (pain and swelling in an extremity). \n\n\u2022 Cases of transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) that causes hypoxia (lack of oxygen), \ndyspnoea (difficulty in breathing), tachypnoea (rapid breathing), cyanosis (lack of oxygen in \nthe blood), fever and hypotension. \n\n \nOther side effects: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 infusions): \n\u25cf headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 infusions): \n\u25cf tachycardia (acceleration of the heart activity) \n\u25cf hypotension (low blood pressure) \n\u25cf fever (body temperature increased) \n\u25cf rigors (cold shivering sensation) or chills \n\u25cf nausea \n\u25cf vomiting \n\u25cf back pain \n\u25cf myalgia (muscle pain) \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 65 - \n \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 infusions): \n\u25cf hypersensitivity \n\u25cf influenza (flu) \n\u25cf dizziness (motion sickness) \n\u25cf tremor (to tremble) \n\u25cf photophobia (excessive sensitivity to light) \n\u25cf vertigo \n\u25cf hypertension (high blood pressure) \n\u25cf wheezing \n\u25cf abdominal pain (including abdominal pain upper) \n\u25cf diarrhoea \n\u25cf flatulence \n\u25cf pruritus \n\u25cf rash \n\u25cf limb discomfort \n\u25cf muscle spasms and muscle tightness \n\u25cf neck pain \n\u25cf pain in extremity \n\u25cf chest discomfort/chest pain \n\u25cf fatigue \n\u25cf feeling cold \n\u25cf malaise \n\u25cf oedema peripheral \n\u25cf heart rate increased \n\u25cf contusion \n\u25cf urinary infection \n\u25cf meningitis aseptic (non-infective meningitis) \n\u25cf red blood cells and white blood cells decreased \n\u25cf anorexia (lack of appetite) \n\u25cf insomnia \n\u25cf radicular syndrome (neck or back pain and other symptoms such as numbness, tingling and \n\nweakness in the arms or legs) \n\u25cf syncope vasovagal (temporary loss of consciousness) \n\u25cf conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjuntiva of the eyes) \n\u25cf maculopathy (illness of the macula, in the retina of the eyes) \n\u25cf vision blurred \n\u25cf ear pain \n\u25cf cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin) \n\u25cf blood pressure increased or decreased \n\u25cf flushing (to blush) \n\u25cf haematoma \n\u25cf thrombosis \n\u25cf lymphoedema \n\u25cf dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing) \n\u25cf epistaxis (haemorrhage from the nose) \n\u25cf postnasal drip (excessive mucus) \n\u25cf sinus pain \n\u25cf upper-airway cough syndrome \n\u25cf abdominal discomfort and distension \n\u25cf dry mouth \n\u25cf haematemesis (vomiting blood) \n\u25cf acne \n\u25cf alopecia \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 66 - \n \n\n\u25cf hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)  \n\u25cf ecchymosis (large skin haematoma) \n\u25cf erythema (redness of the skin)  \n\u25cf arthralgia (joint pain) \n\u25cf musculoskeletal discomfort  \n\u25cf infusion related reaction and infusion site reaction (including infusion site erythema and \n\ninfusion site pain) \n\u25cf feeling jittery (nervousness) \n\u25cf influenza like illness \n\u25cf general physical health deterioration \n\u25cf haemoglobin decreased \n\u25cf reticulocyte count increased \n\u25cf heart rate decreased \n \nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents \n \nIt was observed that the proportion of headache, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, \nheart rate increase and back pain in children was higher than in adults.

If tolerated, advance to 0.02 ml/kg/min for the second 30 minutes. Again, if tolerated, \nadvance to 0.04 ml/kg/min for the third 30 minutes. If the patient tolerates the infusion well, \nadditional increments of 0.02 ml/kg/min may be made at 30-minute intervals up to a maximum of \n0.08 ml/kg/min.  \n \nIt has been reported that the frequency of adverse reactions to IVIg increases with the infusion rate. \nInfusion rates during the initial infusions should be slow. If there are no adverse reactions, the \ninfusion rate for subsequent infusions can be slowly increased to the maximum rate. For patients \nexperiencing adverse reactions, it is advisable to reduce the infusion rate in subsequent infusions and \nlimit the maximum rate to 0.04 ml/kg/min, or administer IVIg at a 5% concentration. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAs the dosage for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the \nabove mentioned conditions, the dosage in children is not considered to be different to that of adults. \n \nIncompatibilities \n \nFlebogamma DIF should not be mixed with other medicines or intravenous solutions and it should be \nadministered by a separate intravenous line. \n \nSpecial precautions \n \nSorbitol \n \nEach ml of this medicinal product contains 50 mg of sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of fructose intolerance must not take this medicine.  \nIn babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) may not \nyet be diagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this medicinal product. \nIn persons more than 2 years old with HFI, a spontaneous aversion for fructose-containing \nfoods develops and may be combined with the onset of symptoms (vomiting, gastro-intestinal \ndisorders, apathy, height and weight retardation). Therefore a detailed history with regard to \nHFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to receiving Flebogamma DIF.  \nIn case of inadvertent administration and suspicion of fructose intolerance the infusion has to \nbe stopped immediately, normal glycaemia has to be re-established and organ function has to be \nstabilized by means of intensive care.  \n \nInterferences with determination of blood glucose levels are not expected.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n - 70 - \n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Flebogamma DIF is administered to a patient, the \nname and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient \nand the batch of the product. \n \nInstructions for handling and disposal \n \nThe product should be brought at room temperature (no more than 30 \u00baC) before use. \n \nThe solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. Do not use Flebogamma DIF if you notice that the \nsolution is cloudy or has deposits. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

need to know before you use flebogamma dif", "Section_Content": "do not use flebogamma dif - if you are allergic to human normal immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you do not have enough immunoglobulins of the type iga in your blood or have developed antibodies to iga. - if you have fructose intolerance, a quite rare genetic condition where the enzyme for breaking down fructose is not produced. in babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary fructose intolerance may not yet be diagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this medicine (see special warnings about excipients at the end of this section). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using flebogamma dif. certain side effects may occur more frequently: in case of high rate of infusion. if you are having flebogamma dif for the first time, or it has been switched from an alternative human normal immunoglobulin (ivig) product, or it is a long time since your last infusion (e.g. several weeks). you will be watched carefully until an hour after the infusion to detect potential side effects. allergic reactions are rare. it may happen particularly if you do not have enough immunoglobulins of the type iga in your blood or have developed antibodies to iga. patients with pre-existing risk factors please tell your doctor if you have any other condition and/or illness, as control is required in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events (formation of blood clots inside your blood). in particular, tell your doctor if you have: diabetes high blood pressure history of vascular disease or thrombosis overweight blood volume decrease - 52 - diseases which increase blood viscosity age over 65 patients with a kidney problem if you have a renal disease and you are receiving flebogamma dif for the first time, you may suffer a problem in your kidneys. your doctor will consider your risk factors and take measures such as to decrease the rate of infusion or to stop the treatment. effects on blood tests after receiving flebogamma dif, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be interfered for a certain time. if you have a blood test after receiving flebogamma dif, please tell the analyst or your doctor that you have been given this medicine. special safety warning when medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. these include: careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections, the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. this applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. the measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis a and parvovirus b19 viruses. immunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis a or parvovirus b19 infections possibly because the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective. it is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of flebogamma dif, the name and batch number of the medicine (stated on the label and carton after lot) are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. children and adolescents vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate) should be observed during the infusion of flebogamma dif. other medicines and flebogamma dif tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. - 53 - effects on vaccines: flebogamma dif may reduce the effectiveness of certain types of vaccines (live attenuated virus vaccines). in case of rubella, mumps and varicella a period of up to 3 months should elapse after receiving this medicine and before receiving these vaccines. in case of measles, the period is up to 1 year. you should avoid the concomitant use of medicines that increase the excretion of water from your body (loop diuretics) during treatment with flebogamma dif. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. driving and using machines patients may experience reactions (for example dizziness or nausea) during treatment, which might affect the ability to drive and use machines. flebogamma dif contains sorbitol this medicine contains 50 mg of sorbitol per ml. if you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. in persons more than 2 years old with problems to tolerate fructose, a spontaneous reaction for fructose-containing foods develops which may have the following symptoms: vomiting, gastro-intestinal disorders, apathy, height and weight retardation. therefore, patients should be examined for the symptoms of hereditary fructose intolerance prior to receiving flebogamma dif. flebogamma dif contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial of 10 ml, 50 ml, 100 ml and 200 ml, that is to say essentially \"sodium free\". this medicine contains less than 29,41 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial of 400 ml. this is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. however, depending on the required dose, the patient may receive more than 1 vial.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "flebogamma

self-administer it alone; a responsible adult must be always present. the dose that you will be given will depend on your illness and body weight and will be worked out by your doctor (please see section \"instructions for healthcare professionals\" given at the end of this leaflet). at the beginning of your infusion you will receive flebogamma dif at a slow rate (0.01 - 0.02 ml/kg/min). depending on how comfortable you feel, your doctor may then gradually increase the infusion rate (up to 0.1 ml/kg/min). - 54 - use in children of more than 2 years old the dose in children is not considered to be different to that of adults as it will be given depending on the illness and body weight of the children. if you use more flebogamma dif than you should if you get more flebogamma dif than you should, your body may take on too much fluid. this could particularly happen when you are a patient at risk, e.g. an elderly patient or a patient having problems with your heart or your kidneys. tell your doctor immediately. if you forget to use flebogamma dif tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately and follow his/her instructions. you must not be given a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "flebogamma dif", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
