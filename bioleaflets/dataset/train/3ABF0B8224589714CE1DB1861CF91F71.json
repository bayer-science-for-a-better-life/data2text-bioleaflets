PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection). \nClear to slightly opalescent liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in adults and children from 9 years of age.  \n \nFlucelvax Tetra should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and children from 9 years of age: \n \nA single 0.5 ml dose.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Flucelvax Tetra in children from birth to less than 9 years of age has not \nbeen established. Currently available safety and immunogenicity data are described in sections 4.8 and \n5.1 but no recommendation on posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration  \n\nFor intramuscular injection only.  \nThe preferred site for injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.  \n \nThe vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be \nmixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. \n \nFor instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible \ntrace residues such as beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and polysorbate 80. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nVaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved.  \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, Flucelvax Tetra must be administered with caution to individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular \nadministration. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient \nto prevent influenza. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with Flucelvax Tetra. There are no data available on co-\nadministration of Flucelvax Tetra with other vaccines. Based on clinical experience with cell-based \ntrivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc), Flucelvax Tetra can be given at the same time as other vaccines. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data from the use of Flucelvax Tetra in pregnant women. However, inactivated \ninfluenza vaccines can be used in all stages of pregnancy. For egg-derived influenza vaccines larger \ndatasets on safety are available for the second and third trimester, compared with the first trimester; \nhowever, data from worldwide use of influenza vaccine do not indicate any adverse foetal and \nmaternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine. \n \nThere are no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies with Flucelvax Tetra. Reproductive \nand developmental toxicology data from cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) do not predict \nan increased risk of developmental abnormalities. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether Flucelvax Tetra is excreted in human milk. No effects on breast fed \nnewborn/infant are anticipated. Flucelvax Tetra may be used during lactation. \n \nFertility \nNo human fertility data are available. Animal data, with cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc), \nhave not shown effects on female fertility. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFlucelvax Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Flucelvax Tetra in adults 18 years and older was evaluated in a randomised, controlled \nstudy (V130_01), in which 1334 subjects received Flucelvax Tetra. Similar rates of solicited local and \nsystemic adverse reactions were reported in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra and cell-based \ntrivalent influenza vaccine comparator in this clinical trial. \n \nThe most commonly reported (\u226510%) reactions in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra were pain at \nthe injection site (34%), headache (14%), fatigue (14%), myalgia (14%), erythema (13%) and \ninduration (10%). \n \nThe incidence of some adverse reactions were considerably lower among subjects \u2265 65 years of age \nwhen compared to subjects 18 to < 65 years of age (see table below).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common \n(\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nTable 1:  Adverse reactions reported following vaccination in adults 18 years and older in \nclinical trials and post-marketing surveilance. \n\nMedDRA System Organ class Very common \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n\n<1/100) \n\nFrequency  \nnot known3 \n\nImmune system disorders    Allergic or \nimmediate \nhypersensitivity \nreactions, including \nanaphylactic shock \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Loss of appetite   \n\nNervous system disorders Headache1   Paraesthesia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Nausea,  \nDiarrhoea,  \nVomiting2 \n\n  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n   Generalised skin \nreactions including \npruritus, urticaria or \nnon-specific rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nMyalgia1 Arthralgia   \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nInjection site pain, \nFatigue1,  \nErythema, \nInduration1  \n\nEcchymosis,  \nChills \n\nFever (\u2265 38\u00b0C) Extensive swelling \nof injected limb   \n\n1 Reported as Common in the elderly population 65 years of age and older \n2 Reported as Uncommon in the elderly population 65 years of age and older \n3 Adverse reactions reported from post-marketing surveillance \n \nPaediatric population (9 to less than 18 years of age) \n \nThe safety of Flucelvax Tetra in children 4 to less than 18 years of age was evaluated in a randomised, \ncontrolled study (V130_03). In this study, 1159 paediatric subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (584 \nsubjects aged > 9 to < 18 years; 575 subjects aged > 4 to < 9 years). Children 9 to less than 18 years of \nage received a single dose of Flucelvax Tetra. Children 4 to less than 9 years of age received one or \ntwo doses (separated by 4 weeks) of Flucelvax Tetra based on determination of the subject\u2019s prior \ninfluenza vaccination history. In this age group, 235 paediatric subjects received one dose and 340 \nsubjects received two doses. Similar rates of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were \nreported in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra and cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine \ncomparator in this clinical trial.  \n \nThe most common (\u226510%) adverse reactions reported in paediatric subjects of 9  to  < 18 years of age \nwere injection site pain (58%), headache (22%), erythema (19%), fatigue (18%), myalgia (16%), and \ninduration (15%). Similar rates of local and system adverse reactions were reported in the overall \npaediatric population 4 to < 18 years of age. \n \nCompared to adults 18 years of age and older, paediatric subjects generally reported higher rates of local \nand systemic adverse reactions. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nPaediatric Population (4 to less than 9 years of age) \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is not indicated for use in children less than 9 years of age, see section 4.2. The available \nsafety data in the paediatric population are presented below. \n \nChildren less than 9 years of age reported similar rates of adverse reactions compared to older children.  \n \nIn the paediatric population 4 to less than 6 years of age, the following additional solicited adverse \nreactions were reported: sleepiness (21%), irritability (19%) and change in eating habits (14%). \n \nIn children who received a second dose of Flucelvax Tetra or cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine, the \nincidence of adverse reactions following the second dose of vaccine was similar to that observed with \nthe first dose in this clinical trial. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are no data for overdose with Flucelvax Tetra. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFlucelvax Tetra provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and \ntwo B types) contained in the vaccine. Flucelvax Tetra induces humoral antibodies against the \nhaemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is manufactured using Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. \n \nSpecific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated \ninfluenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus. In some human \nstudies, antibody titres of 1:40 or greater have been associated with protection from influenza illness in \nup to 50% of subjects. \n \nAntibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. \nFurthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new \nantigenic variant of the same type or subtype.  \n \nAnnual revaccination with current influenza vaccines is recommended because immunity declines \nduring the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus may change from year to \nyear. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nImmunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra in Adults 18 years of age and older \nImmunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in adults 18 years of age and older in a randomised, \ndouble-blind, controlled study (V130_01). In this study, subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (N = 1334) \nor one of the two formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) [TIV1c \n(N = 677) or TIV2c (N = 669)]. The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed, \n21 days after vaccination. \n \nThe immunogenicity endpoints were geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs) of haemagglutination \ninhibition (HI) antibodies response and percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversions, defined \nas a pre-vaccination HI titre of <1:10 with a post vaccination titre \u22651:40 or with a prevaccination HI \ntitre of \u226510 and a minimum 4-fold increase in serum HI antibody titre. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra was non-inferior to TIVc. Non-inferiority was established for all 4 influenza strains \nincluded in Flucelvax Tetra, as assessed by ratios of GMTs and the differences in the percentages of \nsubjects achieving seroconversion at 3 weeks following vaccination. The antibody response to \ninfluenza B strains contained in Flucelvax Tetra was superior to the antibody response after \nvaccination with TIVc containing an influenza B strain from the alternate lineage. There was no \nevidence that the addition of the second influenza B strain resulted in immune interference to other \nstrains included in the vaccine. \n \nAge subgroup analyses in subjects 18 to less than 65 years of age and 65 years of age and above \nconfirmed that HI antibody responses (GMT and differences in vaccine group seroconversion rates) \nmet non-inferiority immunogenicity criteria 3 weeks following vaccination for all 4 influenza strains \nin both age groups. \n \nThe non-inferiority data observed are summarised in Table 2. \n \nTable 2:  Noninferiority of Flucelvax Tetra relative to TIVc in adults 18 years of age and above \n\n\u2013 Per protocol analysis set (V130_01) \n \n\n \n\nFlucelvax Tetra \nN = 1250 \n\nTIV1c/TIV2ca \nN = 635/N = 639 \n\nVaccine Group \nRatio \n\n(95% CI) \n\nVaccine \nGroup \n\nDifference \n(95% CI) \n\nA\n/H\n\n1N\n1 GMT \n\n(95% CI) \n302.8 \n\n(281.8-325.5) \n298.9 \n\n(270.3-330.5) \n1.0 \n\n(0.9-1.1) - \n\nSeroconversion \nRateb (95% CI) \n\n49.2% \n(46.4-52.0) \n\n48.7% \n(44.7-52.6) - \n\n-0.5% \n(-5.3-4.2) \n\nA\n/H\n\n3N\n2 GMT \n\n(95% CI) \n372.3 \n\n(349.2-396.9) \n378.4 \n\n(345.1-414.8) \n1.0 \n\n(0.9-1.1) - \n\nSeroconversion \nRateb (95% CI) \n\n38.3% \n(35.6-41.1) \n\n35.6% \n(31.9-39.5) - \n\n-2.7% \n(-7.2-1.9) \n\nB\n1 \n\nGMT \n(95% CI) \n\n133.2 \n(125.3-141.7) \n\n115.6 \n(106.4-125.6) \n\n0.9 \n(0.8-1.0) - \n\nSeroconversion \nRateb (95% CI) \n\n36.6% \n(33.9-39.3) \n\n34.8% \n(31.1-38.7) - \n\n-1.8% \n(-6.2-2.8) \n\nB\n2 \n\nGMT \n(95% CI) \n\n177.2 \n(167.6-187.5) \n\n164.0 \n(151.4-177.7) \n\n0.9 \n(0.9-1.0) - \n\nSeroconversion \nRateb (95% CI) \n\n39.8% \n(37.0-42.5) \n\n35.4% \n(31.7-39.2) - \n\n-4.4% \n(-8.9-0.2) \n\nAbbreviations: GMT = geometric mean titre; CI = confidence interval.  \na The comparator vaccine for noninferiority comparisons for A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B1 is TIV1c, for B2 it is \nTIV2c. \nb Seroconversion rate = percentage of subjects with either a pre-vaccination HI titre <1:10 and post-vaccination \nHI titre \u22651:40 or with a pre-vaccination HI titre \u22651:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI \nantibody titre. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nBold = Non-inferiority criterion met. \n \nClinical efficacy of cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) against culture-confirmed influenza \nin adults \n \nThe efficacy experience with TIVc is relevant to Flucelvax Tetra because both vaccines are \nmanufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.  \n \nA multinational, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (V58P13) was performed to \nassess clinical efficacy and safety of TIVc during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults aged 18 to \nless than 50 years. A total of 11,404 subjects were enrolled to receive TIVc (N = 3828), Agrippal \n(N = 3676) or placebo (N = 3900) in a 1:1:1 ratio.  \n\nTIVc efficacy was defined as the prevention of culture-confirmed symptomatic influenza illness \ncaused by viruses antigenically matched to those in the vaccine compared to placebo. Influenza cases \nwere identified by active and passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was defined \naccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition, i.e., a fever (oral \ntemperature \u2265100.0\u00b0F / 38\u00b0C) and cough or sore throat. After an episode of ILI, nose and throat swab \nsamples were collected for analysis. Vaccine efficacies against vaccine-matched influenza viral \nstrains, against all influenza viral strains, and against individual influenza viral subtypes were \ncalculated (Table 3). \n \nTable 3:  Comparative efficacy of TIVc versus placebo against culture-confirmed influenza by \n\ninfluenza viral subtype (V58P13) \n TIVc \n\n(N = 3776) \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 3843) \nVaccine Efficacy* \n\n Attack Rate \n(%) \n\nNumber of \nSubjects with \n\nInfluenza \n\nAttack Rate \n(%) \n\nNumber of \nSubjects with \n\nInfluenza \n\n% Lower Limit \nof One-\n\nSided 97.5% \nCI \n\nAntigenically Matched Strains \n\nOverall 0.19 7 1.14 44 83.8 61.0 \n\nIndividual \nstrains \n\nA/H3N2** 0.05  2 0 0 -- -- \n\nA/H1N1 0.13 5 1.12 43 88.2 67.4 \n\nB** 0 0 0.03 1 -- -- \n\nAll Culture-Confirmed Influenza \n\nOverall 1.11 42 3.64 140 69.5 55.0 \n\nIndividual \nstrains \n\nA/H3N2 0.16 6 0.65 25 75.6 35.1 \n\nA/H1N1 0.16 6 1.48 57 89.3 73.0 \n\nB 0.79 30 1.59 61 49.9 18.2 \n*  Simultaneous one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals for the vaccine efficacy of each influenza vaccine \n\nrelative to placebo based on the Sidak-corrected score confidence intervals for the two relative risks.  \nVaccine Efficacy = (1 - Relative Risk) x 100%; \n\n**  There were too few cases of influenza due to vaccine-matched influenza A/H3N2 or B to adequately assess \nvaccine efficacy. \n\n \nPaediatric population  \n \nImmunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra in Children and Adolescents 9 to less than 18 Years of Age \n \nImmunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in children 9 to less than 18 years of age as part of a \nrandomised, double-blind, controlled study (V130_03) that was performed in the paediatric population \n4 to less than 18 years of age. In this study, subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (N = 1159) or one of the \ntwo formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) [TIV1c (N = 593), or \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nTIV2c (N = 580)]. The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed 21 days after \nvaccination. \nThe immunogenicity endpoints were GMTs of HI antibodies response and percentage of subjects who \nachieved seroconversions (seroconversion rate), defined as a pre-vaccination HI titre of <1:10 with a \npost-vaccination titre \u22651:40 or with a pre-vaccination HI titre \u2265 1:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in \nserum HI antibody titre. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra was noninferior to TIVc in children 4 to less than 18 years of age. Non-inferiority was \nestablished for all 4 influenza strains included in the Flucelvax Tetra, as assessed by ratios of GMTs \nand the differences in the percentages of subjects achieving seroconversion at 3 weeks following \nvaccination. The antibody response to influenza B strains contained in Flucelvax Tetra was superior to \nthe antibody response after vaccination with TIVc containing an influenza B strain from the alternate \nlineage.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Flucelvax Tetra is and what it is used for \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is a vaccine against flu (influenza). Flucelvax Tetra is prepared in cell cultures, and, \ntherefore, is egg-free. \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is used to prevent flu in adults and children from 9 years of age. \n \nThe vaccine targets four strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World \nHealth Organisation for the 2020/2021 season. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Flucelvax Tetra \n \nYou should not receive Flucelvax Tetra: \nIf you are allergic to: \n\n\u2022 the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\u2022 beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, or polysorbate 80, which are trace \n\nresidues from the manufacturing process. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Flucelvax Tetra. \n \nBEFORE receiving the vaccine \n\u2022 Your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily \n\navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nsuch as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the \nadministration. This reaction may occur with Flucelvax Tetra as with all vaccines that are injected. \n\n\u2022 You should tell your doctor if you have an acute illness associated with fever. Your doctor may \ndecide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone. \n\n\u2022 You should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment \nwhich affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or \ncorticosteroid medicines (see section \u201cOther medicines and Flucelvax Tetra\u201d). \n\n\u2022 You should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n\u2022 Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or \n\nnurse if you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Flucelvax Tetra may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \nOther medicines and Flucelvax Tetra  \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other \nvaccine. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra may be given at the same time as other vaccines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nPregnancy: \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. \nInfluenza vaccinations can be used at any stage of pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding: \nUse of Flucelvax Tetra during breast-feeding has not been studied. Flucelvax Tetra may be used \nduring breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nFlucelvax Tetra has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra contains sodium chloride and potassium chloride \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium free\u2019. \nThis vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018potassium free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How Flucelvax Tetra is given \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is given to you by your doctor or nurse as an injection into the muscle at the top of the \nupper arm (deltoid muscle). \n \nAdults and children from 9 years of age: \n \nOne dose of 0.5 ml \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nThe following side effects have been reported during clinical trials and during general use: \n \nVery serious side effects \nTell your doctor immediately or go to the casualty department at your nearest hospital if you \nexperience the following side effect \u2013 you may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation: \n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n\u2022 difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash which are symptoms of an \nanaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction) \n \n\nSerious side effects \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects \u2013 you may need \nmedical attention: \n \n\u2022 Extensive swelling of injected limb \n \nMild side effects \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Injection site pain, reddening, hardening or swelling at the site of the injection \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Muscle pain  \n\u2022 Tiredness \nHardening or swelling at the site of the injection, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue were common in \nthe elderly. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea  \n\u2022 Loss of appetite \n\u2022 Joint pain \n\u2022 Bruising \n\u2022 Shivering \nVomiting was uncommon in the elderly  \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Fever (> 38\u00b0C) \nFever was common in adolescents and children.  \n \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\u2022 Numbness and tingling sensation \n\u2022 Generalised skin reactions including itching, bumps on the skin or non-specific rash \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your healthcare professional.

receiving the vaccine your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms 24 such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the administration. this reaction may occur with flucelvax tetra as with all vaccines that are injected. you should tell your doctor if you have an acute illness associated with fever. your doctor may decide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone. you should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines (see section \"other medicines and flucelvax tetra\"). you should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. as with all vaccines, flucelvax tetra may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. other medicines and flucelvax
