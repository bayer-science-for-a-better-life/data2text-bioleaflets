NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGONAL-f 75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 5.5 micrograms of follitropin alfa* equivalent to 75 IU. Each mL of the \nreconstituted solution contains 75 IU. \n* recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary \n(CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nAppearance of the powder: white lyophilised pellet. \nAppearance of the solvent: clear colourless solution. \n \nThe pH of the reconstituted solution is 6.5-7.5. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to \n\ntreatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. \n\n• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical \ntrials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or \n\nacquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotropin \n(hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility disorders. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment \nof GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring \nprocedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal \nproducts. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \n\n\n\n3 \n\nComparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation. See section 5.1. \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nGONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher \nthan 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should \nbe abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human \nchoriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU, up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day \nof, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be \nperformed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f \ndaily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first \n7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f \nshould be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients \nare amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and oestrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG \nadministration. Alternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism \nGONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of GONAL-f \nin elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. \n \nThe first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-\nadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately \ntrained and have access to expert advice. \n \nThe injection site should be alternated daily. \n \nFor instructions on the reconstitution and administration of GONAL-f powder and solvent for solution \nfor injection see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology \n\n\n\n5 \n\n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma \n \nGONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: \n• primary ovarian failure \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n• primary testicular insufficiency \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nGONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and \nshould only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their \nmanagement. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \n \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to \nrecommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will \nminimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with \nGONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of \novarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound \nscans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared \nwith natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, \nespecially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \n \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response \ncannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \n \nGONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, \nclomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist \nor antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an \nadequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been \nreported during GONAL-f therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed \npregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of \nfollitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n\n\n\n8 \n\nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nGONAL-f. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nGONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGONAL-f is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the object of GONAL-f therapy \nis to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the \nadministration of hCG. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety in women \n \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and \nin ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and \na shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \nIn ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a \nhigher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nGONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n \n\n GONAL-f \n(n = 130) \n\nurinary FSH  \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of \nFSH 75 IU ampoules)  \n\n27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \n\nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \n \nIn men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary Menopausal \nGonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of \nlimited clinical relevance. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to \n\ntreatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. \n\n• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical \ntrials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or \n\nacquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotropin \n(hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment \nof GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring \nprocedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal \nproducts. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \nComparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation. See section 5.1. \n \nBioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and \nthe multidose presentation of GONAL-f. \n \nThe following table states the volume to be administered to deliver the prescribed dose: \n \n\nDose (IU) Volume to be injected (mL) \n75 0.13 \n\n150 0.25 \n225 0.38 \n300 0.50 \n375 0.63 \n450 0.75 \n\n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nGONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher \nthan 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should \nbe abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human \nchoriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU, up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day \nof, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be \nperformed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f \ndaily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first \n7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f \nshould be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients \nare amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and oestrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG \nadministration. Alternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism \nGONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of GONAL-f \nin elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nGONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. \n \nThe first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-\nadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately \ntrained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the \npatients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. \n \nDue to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive \ndays. \n \nIndividual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only. \n \nFor instructions on the reconstitution and administration of GONAL-f powder and solvent for solution \nfor injection see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma \n \nGONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: \n• primary ovarian failure \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n• primary testicular insufficiency \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nGONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and \nshould only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their \nmanagement. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nPorphyria \n \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to \nrecommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will \nminimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with \nGONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of \novarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound \nscans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \n\n\n\n18 \n\nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared \nwith natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, \nespecially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nTreatment in men \n \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response \ncannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \n \nGONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. \n \nSolvent containing benzyl alcohol \n \nFollowing reconstitution with the solvent provided, this medicinal product contains 1.23 mg benzyl \nalcohol in each 75 IU dose, which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic \nreactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, \nclomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist \nor antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an \nadequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been \nreported during GONAL-f therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed \npregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of \nfollitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nGONAL-f. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nGONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGONAL-f is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, varicocele \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the object of GONAL-f therapy \nis to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the \nadministration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \n \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and \nin ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and \na shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \nIn ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a \nhigher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nGONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n \n\n GONAL-f \n(n = 130) \n\nurinary FSH  \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of \nFSH 75 IU ampoules)  \n\n27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \n\nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \n \nIn men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. \n \nIn rabbits, the formulation reconstituted with 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 0.9% benzyl alcohol alone, both \nresulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild \ninflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary Menopausal \nGonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of \nlimited clinical relevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to \n\ntreatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. \n\n• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical \ntrials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or \n\nacquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotropin \n(hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment \nof GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring \nprocedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal \nproducts. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \nComparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation. See section 5.1. \n \nBioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and \nthe multidose presentation of GONAL-f. \n \nThe following table states the volume to be administered to deliver the prescribed dose: \n \n\nDose (IU) Volume to be injected (mL) \n75 0.13 \n\n150 0.25 \n225 0.38 \n300 0.50 \n375 0.63 \n450 0.75 \n\n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nGONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher \nthan 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should \nbe abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human \nchoriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU, up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day \nof, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be \nperformed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f \ndaily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first \n7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f \nshould be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients \nare amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and oestrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG \nadministration. Alternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism \nGONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of GONAL-f \nin elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nGONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. \n \nThe first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-\nadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately \ntrained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the \npatients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. \n \nDue to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive \ndays. \n \nIndividual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only. \n \nFor instructions on the reconstitution and administration of GONAL-f powder and solvent for solution \nfor injection see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma \n \nGONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: \n• primary ovarian failure \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n• primary testicular insufficiency \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nGONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and \nshould only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their \nmanagement. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nPorphyria \n \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to \nrecommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will \nminimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with \nGONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of \novarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound \nscans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \n\n\n\n30 \n\nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared \nwith natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, \nespecially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nTreatment in men \n \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response \ncannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \n \nGONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. \n \nSolvent containing benzyl alcohol \n \nFollowing reconstitution with the solvent provided, this medicinal product contains 1.23 mg benzyl \nalcohol in each 75 IU dose, which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic \nreactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, \nclomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist \nor antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an \nadequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been \nreported during GONAL-f therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed \npregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of \nfollitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nGONAL-f. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nGONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGONAL-f is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, varicocele \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the object of GONAL-f therapy \nis to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the \nadministration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \n \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and \nin ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and \na shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \nIn ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a \nhigher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nGONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n \n\n GONAL-f \n(n = 130) \n\nurinary FSH  \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of \nFSH 75 IU ampoules)  \n\n27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \n\nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n34 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \n \nIn men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. \n \nIn rabbits, the formulation reconstituted with 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 0.9% benzyl alcohol alone, both \nresulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild \ninflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary Menopausal \nGonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of \nlimited clinical relevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to \n\ntreatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. \n\n• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical \ntrials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or \n\nacquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotropin \n(hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment \nof GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring \nprocedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal \nproducts. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \nComparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation. See section 5.1. \n \nBioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and \nthe multidose presentation of GONAL-f. \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nGONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher \nthan 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should \nbe abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human \nchoriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU, up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day \nof, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be \nperformed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f \ndaily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first \n7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f \nshould be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients \nare amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and oestrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG \nadministration. Alternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism \nGONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of GONAL-f \nin elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. \n \nThe first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-\nadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately \ntrained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the “Instructions for \nuse”. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma \n \nGONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: \n• primary ovarian failure \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n• primary testicular insufficiency \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nGONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and \nshould only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their \nmanagement. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \n \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to \nrecommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will \nminimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \n\n\n\n41 \n\ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with \nGONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of \novarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound \nscans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared \nwith natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, \nespecially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \n \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response \ncannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \n \nGONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, \nclomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist \nor antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an \nadequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been \nreported during GONAL-f therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed \npregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of \nfollitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nGONAL-f. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nGONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGONAL-f is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n45 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the object of GONAL-f therapy \nis to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the \nadministration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \n \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and \nin ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and \na shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \nIn ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a \nhigher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nGONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n \n\n GONAL-f \n(n = 130) \n\nurinary FSH  \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of \nFSH 75 IU ampoules)  \n\n27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \n\nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \n \nIn men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary Menopausal \nGonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of \nlimited clinical relevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to \n\ntreatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. \n\n• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical \ntrials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or \n\nacquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotropin \n(hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment \nof GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring \nprocedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal \nproducts. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \nComparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation. See section 5.1. \n \nBioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and \nthe multidose presentation of GONAL-f. \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nGONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher \nthan 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should \nbe abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human \nchoriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU, up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day \nof, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be \nperformed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f \ndaily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first \n7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f \nshould be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients \nare amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and oestrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or \n5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f \nand lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on \nthe day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism \nGONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of GONAL-f \nin elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. \n \nThe first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-\nadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately \ntrained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the “Instructions for \nuse”. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma \n \nGONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: \n• primary ovarian failure \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n• primary testicular insufficiency \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nGONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and \nshould only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their \nmanagement. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \n \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to \nrecommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will \nminimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \n\n\n\n52 \n\ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with \nGONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of \novarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound \nscans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared \nwith natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, \nespecially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \n \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response \ncannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \n \nGONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, \nclomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist \nor antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an \nadequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been \nreported during GONAL-f therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed \npregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of \nfollitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nGONAL-f. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nGONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGONAL-f is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n56 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the object of GONAL-f therapy \nis to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the \nadministration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \n \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and \nin ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and \na shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \nIn ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a \nhigher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nGONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n \n\n GONAL-f \n(n = 130) \n\nurinary FSH  \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of \nFSH 75 IU ampoules)  \n\n27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \n\nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \n \nIn men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary Menopausal \nGonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of \nlimited clinical relevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to \n\ntreatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. \n\n• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical \ntrials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or \n\nacquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotropin \n(hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment \nof GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring \nprocedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal \nproducts. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \nComparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation. See section 5.1. \n \nBioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and \nthe multidose presentation of GONAL-f. \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nGONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher \nthan 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should \nbe abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human \nchoriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU, up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day \nof, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be \nperformed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f \ndaily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first \n7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f \nshould be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients \nare amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and oestrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or \n5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f \nand lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on \nthe day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism \nGONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of GONAL-f \nin elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. \n \nThe first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-\nadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately \ntrained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the “Instructions for \nuse”. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma \n \nGONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: \n• primary ovarian failure \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n• primary testicular insufficiency \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nGONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and \nshould only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their \nmanagement. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \n \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to \nrecommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will \nminimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \n\n\n\n63 \n\ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with \nGONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of \novarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound \nscans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared \nwith natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, \nespecially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \n \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response \ncannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \n \nGONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, \nclomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist \nor antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an \nadequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been \nreported during GONAL-f therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed \npregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of \nfollitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nGONAL-f. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nGONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGONAL-f is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n67 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the object of GONAL-f therapy \nis to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the \nadministration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \n \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and \nin ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and \na shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \nIn ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a \nhigher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nGONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n \n\n GONAL-f \n(n = 130) \n\nurinary FSH  \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of \nFSH 75 IU ampoules)  \n\n27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \n\nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \n \nIn men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary Menopausal \nGonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of \nlimited clinical relevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to \n\ntreatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. \n\n• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical \ntrials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or \n\nacquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotropin \n(hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment \nof GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring \nprocedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal \nproducts. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \nComparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation. See section 5.1. \n \nBioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and \nthe multidose presentation of GONAL-f. \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nGONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher \nthan 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should \nbe abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human \nchoriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU, up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day \nof, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be \nperformed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f \ndaily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first \n7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f \nshould be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients \nare amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and oestrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or \n5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f \nand lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on \nthe day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism \nGONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of GONAL-f \nin elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. \n \nThe first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-\nadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately \ntrained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the “Instructions for \nuse”. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma \n \nGONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: \n• primary ovarian failure \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n• primary testicular insufficiency \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nGONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and \nshould only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their \nmanagement. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \n \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to \nrecommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will \nminimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \n\n\n\n74 \n\ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with \nGONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of \novarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound \nscans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \n\n\n\n75 \n\nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared \nwith natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, \nespecially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \n \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response \ncannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \n \nGONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, \nclomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist \nor antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an \n\n\n\n76 \n\nadequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been \nreported during GONAL-f therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed \npregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of \nfollitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nGONAL-f. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nGONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGONAL-f is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n78 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the object of GONAL-f therapy \nis to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the \nadministration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \n \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and \nin ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and \na shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \nIn ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a \nhigher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nGONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n \n\n GONAL-f \n(n = 130) \n\nurinary FSH  \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of \nFSH 75 IU ampoules)  \n\n27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \n\nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \n \nIn men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary Menopausal \nGonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of \nlimited clinical relevance. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n121 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nGONAL-f 75 IU powder and solvent  \nfor solution for injection \n\nfollitropin alfa \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f \n3. How to use GONAL-f \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store GONAL-f \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\nHow to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solvent \n \n \n1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for \n \nWhat GONAL-f is \n \nGONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “Follicle \nStimulating Hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. \nGonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nWhat GONAL-f is used for \n \nIn adult women, GONAL-f is used: \n• to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not \n\nrespond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. \n• together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“Luteinising Hormone” or LH) to help \n\nrelease egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are not ovulating because their body is \nproducing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH). \n\n• to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n \nIn adult men, GONAL-f is used: \n• together with another medicine called “human Chorionic Gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f \n \nYou and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n122 \n\nDo not use GONAL-f \n \n• if you are allergic to Follicle Stimulating Hormone or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). \n• if you are a woman: \n\n- with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- with unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n\n(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. \n• if you are a man: \n\n- with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPorphyria \n \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \n \nIn case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, \nfeel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who \nmight ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS \nunless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human Chorionic \nGonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any \nhCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive \nmethod for at least four days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n \nWhen using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n \n\n\n\n123 \n\nMiscarriage \n \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \n \nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with GONAL-f treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \n \nIf you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f \nusually does not work if you have this problem. \n \nIf your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to \nprovide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. \n \nChildren \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated for use in children. \n \nOther medicines and GONAL-f \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n• If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene \n\ncitrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist \n\nor antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nGONAL-f contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to use GONAL-f \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n124 \n\nUsing this medicine \n \nGONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). \n• The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. \n• Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself. \n• If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the \n\nend of this leaflet called “How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution”. \n \nHow much to use \n \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU). \n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. \n \n• GONAL-f is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to \nhave sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of \nGONAL-f than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f \nthan before. \n \nIf you are not ovulating, having no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH \nand LH hormones \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin \nalfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be \nstopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than \nbefore. \n\n\n\n125 \n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG (see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose \nof GONAL-f than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your \n\ntreatment cycle.  \n• GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is \n\n450 IU. \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant \nhCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or \n5,000 IU to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your \neggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start \nof agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is \nadministered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.  \n \nMen \n \n• The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nIf you use more GONAL-f than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS \nwill only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, OHSS). \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk \nto your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nSerious side effects in women \n \n• Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”).

Wash your hands and find a clean area \n \n• It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible. \n• A good place is a clean table or kitchen surface. \n \n \n2. Get together everything you need and lay them out: \n \n• 1 pre-filled syringe containing the solvent (the clear liquid) \n• 1 vial containing GONAL-f (the white powder) \n• 1 needle for preparation \n• 1 fine bore needle for injection under the skin \n \nNot provided in the pack: \n• 2 alcohol swabs \n• 1 sharps container \n \n \n3. Preparing the solution \n \n• Remove the protective caps from the powder vial and from the pre-filled syringe. \n• Attach the needle for preparation to the pre-filled syringe, insert it into the powder vial and \n\nslowly inject all the solvent. Swirl gently without removing the syringe. Do not shake. \n• Check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles. \n• Turn the vial upside down and gently draw the solution back into the syringe by pulling the \n\nplunger. \n• Remove the syringe from the vial and set it down carefully. Do not touch the needle and do not \n\nallow the needle to touch any surface. \n \n\n  \n \n(If you have been prescribed more than one vial of GONAL-f, slowly re-inject the solution into \nanother powder vial, until you have the prescribed number of powder vials dissolved in the solution. If \nyou have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to GONAL-f, you may also mix the two medicines \nas an alternative to injecting each product separately. After dissolving the lutropin alfa powder, draw \nthe solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the vial containing GONAL-f. Once the powder \nhas dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe. Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if \nthe solution is not clear. Up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 mL of solvent.) \n \n \n\n\n\n130 \n\n4. Getting ready the syringe for injection \n \n• Change the needle for the fine bore needle. \n• Remove any air bubbles: If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle \n\npointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top. Push the \nplunger until the air bubbles are gone. \n\n \n \n \n5. Injecting the dose \n \n• Immediately inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to \n\ninject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). To minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site \neach day. \n\n• Clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab using a circular motion. \n• Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like \n\nmotion. \n• Inject under the skin by pushing gently the plunger, as you were taught. Do not inject directly \n\ninto a vein. Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution. \n• Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular \n\nmotion. \n\n \n \n \n6. After the injection \n \nDispose of all used items: Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and \nempty glass containers safely preferably in the sharps container. Any unused solution must be \ndiscarded. \n\n\n\n131 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nGONAL-f 1050 IU/1.75 mL powder and solvent  \nfor solution for injection \n\nfollitropin alfa \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\nHow to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solvent \n \n \n1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for \n \nWhat GONAL-f is \n \nGONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “Follicle \nStimulating Hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. \nGonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nWhat GONAL-f is used for \n \nIn adult women, GONAL-f is used: \n• to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not \n\nrespond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. \n• together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“Luteinising Hormone” or LH) to help \n\nrelease egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are not ovulating because their body is \nproducing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH). \n\n• to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n \nIn adult men, GONAL-f is used: \n• together with another medicine called “human Chorionic Gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f \n \nYou and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n132 \n\nDo not use GONAL-f \n \n• if you are allergic to Follicle Stimulating Hormone or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). \n• if you are a woman: \n\n- with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- with unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n\n(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. \n• if you are a man: \n\n- with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPorphyria \n \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \n \nIn case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, \nfeel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who \nmight ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS \nunless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human Chorionic \nGonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any \nhCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive \nmethod for at least four days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n \nWhen using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n \n\n\n\n133 \n\nMiscarriage \n \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \n \nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with GONAL-f treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \n \nIf you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f \nusually does not work if you have this problem. \n \nIf your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to \nprovide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. \n \nChildren \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated for use in children. \n \nOther medicines and GONAL-f \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n• If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene \n\ncitrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist \n\nor antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nGONAL-f contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \nWhen prepared with the solvent provided, this medicine contains 1.23 mg benzyl alcohol in each \n75 IU dose which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n3. How to use GONAL-f \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n134 \n\nUsing this medicine \n \n• GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The \n\nprepared solution can be used for several injections. \n• The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. \n• Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself. \n• If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the \n\nend of this leaflet called “How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution”. \n \nHow much to use \n \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU), which reflects the grading of the administration syringes \nprovided in the pack. \n \nIf you use another syringe, which shows millilitres (mL) instead of IUs, you can take the correct \namount for injection in mL from the following table: \n \n\nDose to be injected (IU) Volume to be injected (mL) \n75 0.13 \n\n150 0.25 \n225 0.38 \n300 0.50 \n375 0.63 \n450 0.75 \n\n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. \n \n• GONAL-f is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to \nhave sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of \nGONAL-f than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f \nthan before. \n \n\n\n\n135 \n\nIf you are not ovulating, having no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH \nand LH hormones \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin \nalfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be \nstopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than \nbefore. \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG (see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose \nof GONAL-f than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your \n\ntreatment cycle.  \n• GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is \n\n450 IU. \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant \nhCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or \n5,000 IU to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your \neggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start \nof agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is \nadministered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.  \n \nMen \n \n• The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nIf you use more GONAL-f than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS \nwill only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, OHSS). \n \n\n\n\n136 \n\nIf you forget to use GONAL-f \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk \nto your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects in women \n \n• Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n\n• The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n• Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n• Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS \nmay be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). This could cause chest pain, \nbreathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). \n\n \nSerious side effects in men and women \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\ncan sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). \n \nIf you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor \nwho might ask you to stop using GONAL-f. \n \nOther side effects in women \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) \n• Headache \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Abdominal pain \n• Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and bloating \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\nmay occur.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\nHow to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solvent \n \n \n1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for \n \nWhat GONAL-f is \n \nGONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “Follicle \nStimulating Hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. \nGonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nWhat GONAL-f is used for \n \nIn adult women, GONAL-f is used: \n• to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not \n\nrespond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. \n• together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“Luteinising Hormone” or LH) to help \n\nrelease egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are not ovulating because their body is \nproducing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH). \n\n• to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n \nIn adult men, GONAL-f is used: \n• together with another medicine called “human Chorionic Gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f \n \nYou and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n142 \n\nDo not use GONAL-f \n \n• if you are allergic to Follicle Stimulating Hormone or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). \n• if you are a woman: \n\n- with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- with unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n\n(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. \n• if you are a man: \n\n- with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPorphyria \n \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \n \nIn case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, \nfeel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who \nmight ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS \nunless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human Chorionic \nGonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any \nhCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive \nmethod for at least four days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n \nWhen using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n \n\n\n\n143 \n\nMiscarriage \n \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \n \nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with GONAL-f treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \n \nIf you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f \nusually does not work if you have this problem. \n \nIf your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to \nprovide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. \n \nChildren \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated for use in children. \n \nOther medicines and GONAL-f \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n• If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene \n\ncitrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist \n\nor antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nGONAL-f contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \nWhen prepared with the solvent provided, this medicine contains 1.23 mg benzyl alcohol in each \n75 IU dose which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n3. How to use GONAL-f \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n144 \n\nUsing this medicine \n \n• GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The \n\nprepared solution can be used for several injections. \n• The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. \n• Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself. \n• If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the \n\nend of this leaflet called “How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution”. \n \nHow much to use \n \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU), which reflects the grading of the administration syringes \nprovided in the pack. \n \nIf you use another syringe, which shows millilitres (mL) instead of IUs, you can take the correct \namount for injection in mL from the following table: \n \n\nDose to be injected (IU) Volume to be injected (mL) \n75 0.13 \n\n150 0.25 \n225 0.38 \n300 0.50 \n375 0.63 \n450 0.75 \n\n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. \n \n• GONAL-f is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to \nhave sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of \nGONAL-f than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f \nthan before. \n \n\n\n\n145 \n\nIf you are not ovulating, having no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH \nand LH hormones \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin \nalfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be \nstopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than \nbefore. \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG (see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose \nof GONAL-f than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your \n\ntreatment cycle.  \n• GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is \n\n450 IU. \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant \nhCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or \n5,000 IU to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your \neggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start \nof agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is \nadministered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.  \n \nMen \n \n• The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nIf you use more GONAL-f than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS \nwill only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, OHSS). \n \n\n\n\n146 \n\nIf you forget to use GONAL-f \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk \nto your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects in women \n \n• Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n\n• The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n• Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n• Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS \nmay be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). This could cause chest pain, \nbreathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). \n\n \nSerious side effects in men and women \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\ncan sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). \n \nIf you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor \nwho might ask you to stop using GONAL-f. \n \nOther side effects in women \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) \n• Headache \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Abdominal pain \n• Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and bloating \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \n\n\n\n147 \n\nOther side effects in men \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Swelling of the veins above and behind the testicles (varicocele) \n• Breast development, acne or weight gain \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty in breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Follitropin alfa is a type of “Follicle \nStimulating Hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. \nGonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nWhat GONAL-f is used for \n \nIn adult women, GONAL-f is used: \n• to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not \n\nrespond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. \n• together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“Luteinising Hormone” or LH) to help \n\nrelease egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are not ovulating because their body is \nproducing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH). \n\n• to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n \nIn adult men, GONAL-f is used: \n• together with another medicine called “human Chorionic Gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f \n \nYou and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n152 \n\nDo not use GONAL-f \n \n• if you are allergic to Follicle Stimulating Hormone or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). \n• if you are a woman: \n\n- with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- with unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n\n(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. \n• if you are a man: \n\n- with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPorphyria \n \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \n \nIn case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, \nfeel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who \nmight ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS \nunless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human Chorionic \nGonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any \nhCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive \nmethod for at least four days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n \nWhen using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n \n\n\n\n153 \n\nMiscarriage \n \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \n \nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with GONAL-f treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \n \nIf you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f \nusually does not work if you have this problem. \n \nIf your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to \nprovide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. \n \nChildren \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated for use in children. \n \nOther medicines and GONAL-f \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n• If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene \n\ncitrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist \n\nor antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nGONAL-f contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to use GONAL-f \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n154 \n\nUsing this medicine \n \n• GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The pre-\n\nfilled pen can be used for several injections. \n• The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. \n• Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the \n\nmedicine. \n• If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for \n\nuse”. \n \nHow much to use \n \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU). \n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. \n \n• GONAL-f is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to \nhave sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of \nGONAL-f than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f \nthan before. \n \nIf you are not ovulating, having no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH \nand LH hormones \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin \nalfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be \nstopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than \nbefore. \n\n\n\n155 \n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG (see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose \nof GONAL-f than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your \n\ntreatment cycle.  \n• GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is \n\n450 IU. \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant \nhCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or \n5,000 IU to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your \neggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start \nof agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is \nadministered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. \n \nMen \n \n• The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nIf you use more GONAL-f than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS \nwill only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, OHSS). \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk \nto your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n156 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects in women \n \n• Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n\n• The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n• Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n• Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS \nmay be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). This could cause chest pain, \nbreathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). \n\n \nSerious side effects in men and women \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\ncan sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). \n \nIf you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor \nwho might ask you to stop using GONAL-f. \n \nOther side effects in women \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) \n• Headache \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Abdominal pain \n• Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and bloating \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nOther side effects in men \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Swelling of the veins above and behind the testicles (varicocele) \n• Breast development, acne or weight gain \n\n\n\n157 \n\n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty in breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Throw it away in a sharps \ndisposal container. Get a new needle. \n\n \n4.4. Attach the needle \n\n• Screw the threaded tip of the GONAL-f pre-filled pen into the outer needle cap until you \nfeel a light resistance. \n\n \nWarning: Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could be difficult to remove after \n\nthe injection. \n \n\n \n• Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently. Put it \n\naside for later use. \n• Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the needle pointing \n\nupward. \n• Carefully remove and discard the green inner shield.  \n\n \n4.5. Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny drop(s) of fluid \n\n• If you see a tiny drop(s) of fluid proceed to Section 5: \nSetting the dose prescribed by your doctor. \n \nWarning: ONLY check for drop(s) the FIRST TIME \n\nyou use a new GONAL-f pre-filled pen to \nremove air in the system. \n\n \n \n\nCAUTION: \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nIf you do not see a tiny drop(s) at or near the needle tip the first time you use a new pen, you \nmust perform the steps on the next page. \n\n \nIf you do not see a tiny drop(s) of fluid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: \n \n\n \n1. Gently turn the dose setting knob clockwise until it reads 25 in the Dose Feedback Window. \n\nYou can turn the dose knob backwards if you turn it past 25. \n \n\n\n\n163 \n\n \n2. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. \n3. Tap the reservoir holder gently. \n4. Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny drop of liquid will appear at the tip of the \n\nneedle. \n5. Verify that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0”. \n6. Proceed to Section 5: Setting the dose prescribed by your doctor. \n \n \n5. Setting the dose prescribed by your doctor \n \n5.1. The pen contains 150 IU follitropin alfa. \n\n• The 150 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 150 IU. The smallest single-dose \nsetting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments of 12.5 IU. \n\n5.2. Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window \n\n  \n• Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up • Turn the dose setting knob backward to correct \n\nthe dose \n \n5.3. Set the dose that was prescribed by your doctor (in the example shown in the figure, it is 50 IU). \n\n \n \n\nWarning: Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose \nbefore you move on to the next step. \n\n \n \n6. Injecting the dose \n \n6.1. Choose an injection site in the area your doctor or nurse has told you to give the injection. \n\nTo minimize skin irritation, select a different injection \nsite each day. \n\n \n\n \n \nInjection area \n\n\n\n164 \n\n6.2. Clean the skin by wiping with an alcohol swab. \n6.3. Verify once more that the Dose Feedback Window displays the correct dose. \n6.4. Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your doctor or nurse. \n\n• Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely \n(1). \n\n \n• Press the dose knob down as far as it will go \n\nand hold it to complete the full injection. \n• Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of \n\n5 seconds to ensure you inject the full dose (2). \nThe larger the dose, the longer it will take to \ninject. \n\n• The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback \nWindow will turn back to “0”. \n\n \n\n• After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle \nout of the skin while keeping the dose setting \nknob pressed down (3). \n\n• Release the dose setting knob. \n \nWarning: Always make sure to use a new needle \n\nfor each injection. \n \n\n \n \n7. After the injection \n \n7.1. Verify you have given a complete injection \n\n• Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”. \n\n \n \nWarning: If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher than “0”, the GONAL-f \n\npre-filled pen is empty and you have not received your full prescribed dose. \n \n7.2. Complete a partial injection (only when needed) \n\n• The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the missing amount you need to inject using a \nnew pen. \n\n \n• Repeat Section 3 (“Before you start using your GONAL-f pre-filled pen”) through \n\nSection 4 (“Getting your GONAL-f pre-filled pen ready for injection”) with a second \npen. \n\n• Set the dose to the missing amount you recorded in the treatment diary or the number still \ndisplayed in the Dose Feedback Window on your previous pen and inject. \n\n \n\n\n\n165 \n\n7.3.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\nInstructions for use \n \n \n1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for \n \nWhat GONAL-f is \n \nGONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “Follicle \nStimulating Hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. \nGonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nWhat GONAL-f is used for \n \nIn adult women, GONAL-f is used: \n• to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not \n\nrespond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. \n• together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“Luteinising Hormone” or LH) to help \n\nrelease egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are not ovulating because their body is \nproducing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH). \n\n• to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n \nIn adult men, GONAL-f is used: \n• together with another medicine called “human Chorionic Gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f \n \nYou and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n168 \n\nDo not use GONAL-f \n \n• if you are allergic to Follicle Stimulating Hormone or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). \n• if you are a woman: \n\n- with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- with unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n\n(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. \n• if you are a man: \n\n- with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPorphyria \n \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \n \nIn case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, \nfeel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who \nmight ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS \nunless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human Chorionic \nGonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any \nhCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive \nmethod for at least four days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n \nWhen using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n \n\n\n\n169 \n\nMiscarriage \n \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \n \nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with GONAL-f treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \n \nIf you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f \nusually does not work if you have this problem. \n \nIf your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to \nprovide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. \n \nChildren \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated for use in children. \n \nOther medicines and GONAL-f \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n• If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene \n\ncitrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist \n\nor antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nGONAL-f contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to use GONAL-f \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n170 \n\nUsing this medicine \n \n• GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The pre-\n\nfilled pen can be used for several injections. \n• The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. \n• Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the \n\nmedicine. \n• If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for \n\nuse”. \n \nHow much to use \n \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU). \n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. \n \n• GONAL-f is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to \nhave sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of \nGONAL-f than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f \nthan before. \n \nIf you are not ovulating, having no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH \nand LH hormones \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin \nalfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be \nstopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than \nbefore. \n\n\n\n171 \n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG (see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose \nof GONAL-f than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your \n\ntreatment cycle.  \n• GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is \n\n450 IU. \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant \nhCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or \n5,000 IU to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your \neggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start \nof agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is \nadministered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. \n \nMen \n \n• The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nIf you use more GONAL-f than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS \nwill only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, OHSS). \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk \nto your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n172 \n\nSerious side effects in women \n \n• Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n\n• The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n• Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n• Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS \nmay be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). This could cause chest pain, \nbreathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). \n\n \nSerious side effects in men and women \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\ncan sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). \n \nIf you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor \nwho might ask you to stop using GONAL-f. \n \nOther side effects in women \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) \n• Headache \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Abdominal pain \n• Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and bloating \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nOther side effects in men \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Swelling of the veins above and behind the testicles (varicocele) \n• Breast development, acne or weight gain \n \n\n\n\n173 \n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty in breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.

Put it \n\naside for later use. \n• Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the needle pointing \n\nupward. \n• Carefully remove and discard the green inner shield.  \n\n \n4.5. Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny drop(s) of fluid \n\n• If you see a tiny drop(s) of fluid proceed to Section 5: \nSetting the dose prescribed by your doctor. \n \nWarning: ONLY check for drop(s) the FIRST TIME \n\nyou use a new GONAL-f pre-filled pen to \nremove air in the system. \n\n \n \n\nCAUTION: \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nIf you do not see a tiny drop(s) at or near the needle tip the first time you use a new pen, you \nmust perform the steps on the next page. \n\n \nIf you do not see a tiny drop(s) of fluid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: \n \n\n \n1. Gently turn the dose setting knob clockwise until it reads 25 in the Dose Feedback Window. \n\nYou can turn the dose knob backwards if you turn it past 25. \n \n\n\n\n179 \n\n \n2. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. \n3. Tap the reservoir holder gently. \n4. Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny drop of liquid will appear at the tip of the \n\nneedle. \n5. Verify that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0”. \n6. Proceed to Section 5: Setting the dose prescribed by your doctor. \n \n \n5. Setting the dose prescribed by your doctor \n \n5.1. The pen contains 300 IU follitropin alfa. \n\n• The 300 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 300 IU. The smallest single-dose \nsetting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments of 12.5 IU. \n\n5.2. Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window \n\n  \n• Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up • Turn the dose setting knob backward to correct \n\nthe dose \n \n5.3. Set the dose that was prescribed by your doctor (in the example shown in the figure, it is 50 IU). \n\n \n \n\nWarning: Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose \nbefore you move on to the next step. \n\n \n \n6. Injecting the dose \n \n6.1. Choose an injection site in the area your doctor or nurse has told you to give the injection. \n\nTo minimize skin irritation, select a different injection \nsite each day. \n\n \n\n \n \nInjection area \n\n\n\n180 \n\n6.2. Clean the skin by wiping with an alcohol swab. \n6.3. Verify once more that the Dose Feedback Window displays the correct dose. \n6.4. Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your doctor or nurse. \n\n• Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely \n(1). \n\n \n• Press the dose knob down as far as it will go \n\nand hold it to complete the full injection. \n• Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of \n\n5 seconds to ensure you inject the full dose \n(2). The larger the dose, the longer it will take \nto inject. \n\n• The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback \nWindow will turn back to “0”. \n\n \n\n• After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle \nout of the skin while keeping the dose setting \nknob pressed down (3). \n\n• Release the dose setting knob. \n \nWarning: Always make sure to use a new needle \n\nfor each injection. \n \n\n \n \n7. After the injection \n \n7.1. Verify you have given a complete injection \n\n• Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”. \n\n \n \nWarning: If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher than “0”, the GONAL-f \n\npre-filled pen is empty and you have not received your full prescribed dose. \n \n7.2. Complete a partial injection (only when needed) \n\n• The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the missing amount you need to inject using a \nnew pen. \n\n \n• Repeat Section 3 (“Before you start using your GONAL-f pre-filled pen”) through \n\nSection 4 (“Getting your GONAL-f pre-filled pen ready for injection”) with a second \npen. \n\n• Set the dose to the missing amount you recorded in the treatment diary or the number still \ndisplayed in the Dose Feedback Window on your previous pen and inject. \n\n \n\n\n\n181 \n\n7.3. Removing the needle after each injection \n• Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface. \n• Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly with one hand, \n\nand slip the needle into the outer needle cap. \n \n\n• Continue by pushing the capped needle against a firm \nsurface until you hear a “click”. \n\n \n• Grip the outer needle cap and \n\nunscrew the needle by turning \nanti-clockwise. Dispose of the \nused needle safely. \n\n  \n• Never reuse any used needle. Never share needles. \n• Recap the pen. \n\n \n \n7.4. Storing the GONAL-f pre-filled pen \n \n\nCAUTION: \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nNever store the pen with the needle attached. \nAlways remove the needle from the GONAL-f pre-filled pen before replacing the pen cap. \n\n \n• Store the pen in its original packaging in a safe place. \n• When the pen is empty, ask your pharmacist how to dispose of it. \n\n \nWarning: Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n182 \n\n8.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\nInstructions for use \n \n \n1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for \n \nWhat GONAL-f is \n \nGONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “Follicle \nStimulating Hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. \nGonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nWhat GONAL-f is used for \n \nIn adult women, GONAL-f is used: \n• to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not \n\nrespond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. \n• together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“Luteinising Hormone” or LH) to help \n\nrelease egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are not ovulating because their body is \nproducing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH). \n\n• to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n \nIn adult men, GONAL-f is used: \n• together with another medicine called “human Chorionic Gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f \n \nYou and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n184 \n\nDo not use GONAL-f \n \n• if you are allergic to Follicle Stimulating Hormone or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). \n• if you are a woman: \n\n- with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- with unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n\n(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. \n• if you are a man: \n\n- with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPorphyria \n \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \n \nIn case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, \nfeel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who \nmight ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS \nunless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human Chorionic \nGonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any \nhCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive \nmethod for at least four days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n \nWhen using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n \n\n\n\n185 \n\nMiscarriage \n \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \n \nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with GONAL-f treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \n \nIf you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f \nusually does not work if you have this problem. \n \nIf your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to \nprovide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. \n \nChildren \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated for use in children. \n \nOther medicines and GONAL-f \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n• If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene \n\ncitrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist \n\nor antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nGONAL-f contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to use GONAL-f \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n186 \n\nUsing this medicine \n \n• GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The pre-\n\nfilled pen can be used for several injections. \n• The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. \n• Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the \n\nmedicine. \n• If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for \n\nuse”. \n \nHow much to use \n \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU). \n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. \n \n• GONAL-f is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to \nhave sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of \nGONAL-f than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f \nthan before. \n \nIf you are not ovulating, having no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH \nand LH hormones \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin \nalfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be \nstopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than \nbefore. \n\n\n\n187 \n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG (see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose \nof GONAL-f than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your \n\ntreatment cycle.  \n• GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is \n\n450 IU. \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant \nhCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or \n5,000 IU to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your \neggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start \nof agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is \nadministered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. \n \nMen \n \n• The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nIf you use more GONAL-f than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS \nwill only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, OHSS). \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk \nto your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n188 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects in women \n \n• Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n\n• The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n• Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n• Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS \nmay be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). This could cause chest pain, \nbreathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). \n\n \nSerious side effects in men and women \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\ncan sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). \n \nIf you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor \nwho might ask you to stop using GONAL-f. \n \nOther side effects in women \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) \n• Headache \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Abdominal pain \n• Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and bloating \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nOther side effects in men \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n• Swelling of the veins above and behind the testicles (varicocele) \n• Breast development, acne or weight gain \n\n\n\n189 \n\n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty in breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.

Setting the dose prescribed by your doctor \n \n5.1. The pen contains 450 IU follitropin alfa. \n\n• The 450 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 450 IU. The smallest single-dose \nsetting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments of 12.5 IU. \n\n5.2. Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window \n\n  \n• Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up • Turn the dose setting knob backward to correct \n\nthe dose \n \n5.3. Set the dose that was prescribed by your doctor (in the example shown in the figure, it is 50 IU). \n\n \n \n\nWarning: Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose \nbefore you move on to the next step. \n\n \n \n6. Injecting the dose \n \n6.1. Choose an injection site in the area your doctor or nurse has told you to give the injection. \n\nTo minimize skin irritation, select a different injection \nsite each day. \n\n \n\n \n \nInjection area \n\n\n\n196 \n\n6.2. Clean the skin by wiping with an alcohol swab. \n6.3. Verify once more that the Dose Feedback Window displays the correct dose. \n6.4. Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your doctor or nurse. \n\n• Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely (1). \n\n \n• Press the dose knob down as far as it will go \n\nand hold it to complete the full injection. \n• Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of \n\n5 seconds to ensure you inject the full dose (2). \nThe larger the dose, the longer it will take to \ninject. \n\n• The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback \nWindow will turn back to “0”. \n\n \n\n• After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle \nout of the skin while keeping the dose setting \nknob pressed down (3). \n\n• Release the dose setting knob. \n \nWarning: Always make sure to use a new needle for \n\neach injection. \n \n\n \n \n7. After the injection \n \n7.1. Verify you have given a complete injection \n\n• Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”. \n\n \n \n\nWarning: If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher than “0”, the GONAL-f \npre-filled pen is empty and you have not received your full prescribed dose. \n\n \n7.2. Complete a partial injection (only when needed) \n\n• The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the missing amount you need to inject using a \nnew pen. \n\n \n• Repeat Section 3 (“Before you start using your GONAL-f pre-filled pen”) through \n\nSection 4 (“Getting your GONAL-f pre-filled pen ready for injection”) with a second \npen. \n\n• Set the dose to the missing amount you recorded in the treatment diary or the number still \ndisplayed in the Dose Feedback Window on your previous pen and inject. \n\n \n\n\n\n197 \n\n7.3. Removing the needle after each injection \n• Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface. \n• Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly with one hand, \n\nand slip the needle into the outer needle cap. \n \n\n• Continue by pushing the capped needle against a firm \nsurface until you hear a “click”. \n\n \n• Grip the outer needle cap and \n\nunscrew the needle by \nturning anti-clockwise. \nDispose of the used needle \nsafely.  \n\n  \n• Never reuse any used needle. Never share needles. \n• Recap the pen. \n\n \n \n7.4. Storing the GONAL-f pre-filled pen \n \n\nCAUTION: \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nNever store the pen with the needle attached. \nAlways remove the needle from the GONAL-f pre-filled pen before replacing the pen cap. \n• Store the pen in its original packaging in a safe place. \n• When the pen is empty, ask your pharmacist how to dispose of it. \n\n \nWarning: Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n198 \n\n8.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\nInstructions for use \n \n \n1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for \n \nWhat GONAL-f is \n \nGONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “Follicle \nStimulating Hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. \nGonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nWhat GONAL-f is used for \n \nIn adult women, GONAL-f is used: \n• to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not \n\nrespond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. \n• together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“Luteinising Hormone” or LH) to help \n\nrelease egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are not ovulating because their body is \nproducing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH). \n\n• to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n \nIn adult men, GONAL-f is used: \n• together with another medicine called “human Chorionic Gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f \n \nYou and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \n\n\n\n200 \n\nDo not use GONAL-f \n \n• if you are allergic to Follicle Stimulating Hormone or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). \n• if you are a woman: \n\n- with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- with unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n\n(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. \n• if you are a man: \n\n- with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPorphyria \n \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \n \nIn case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, \nfeel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who \nmight ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS \nunless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human Chorionic \nGonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any \nhCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive \nmethod for at least four days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n \nWhen using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n \n\n\n\n201 \n\nMiscarriage \n \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \n \nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with GONAL-f treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \n \nIf you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f \nusually does not work if you have this problem. \n \nIf your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to \nprovide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. \n \nChildren \n \nGONAL-f is not indicated for use in children. \n \nOther medicines and GONAL-f \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n• If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene \n\ncitrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist \n\nor antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nGONAL-f contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to use GONAL-f \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n202 \n\nUsing this medicine \n \n• GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The pre-\n\nfilled pen can be used for several injections. \n• The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. \n• Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the \n\nmedicine. \n• If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for \n\nuse”. \n \nHow much to use \n \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU). \n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. \n \n• GONAL-f is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to \nhave sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of \nGONAL-f than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f \nthan before. \n \nIf you are not ovulating, having no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH \nand LH hormones \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. \n• Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you \n\nget the desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin \nalfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be \nstopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than \nbefore. \n\n\n\n203 \n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG (see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose \nof GONAL-f than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n \n• The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your \n\ntreatment cycle.  \n• GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is \n\n450 IU. \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant \nhCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or \n5,000 IU to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your \neggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start \nof agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is \nadministered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. \n \nMen \n \n• The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nIf you use more GONAL-f than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS \nwill only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, OHSS). \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f \n \nIf you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk \nto your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n204 \n\nSerious side effects in women \n \n• Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n\n• The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n• Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n• Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS \nmay be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people).
