NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPicato 150 micrograms/gram gel \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach gram of gel contains 150 mcg of ingenol mebutate. Each tube contains 70 mcg of ingenol \nmebutate in 0.47 g of gel. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGel. \nClear colourless gel. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPicato is indicated for the cutaneous treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic \nkeratosis in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nActinic keratosis on the face and scalp in adults \nOne tube of Picato 150 mcg/g gel (containing 70 mcg ingenol mebutate) should be applied once daily \nto the affected area for 3 consecutive days. \n \nOptimal therapeutic effect can be assessed approximately 8 weeks after treatment.  \n \nA repeat treatment course of Picato can be given if an incomplete response is seen at a follow-up \nexamination after 8 weeks or if lesions that are cleared at this examination recur in subsequent \nexaminations. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Picato in the paediatric population.  \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.1). \n \nImmunocompromised patients \nClinical data on treatment in immunocompromised patients is not available, but systemic risks are not \nexpected since ingenol mebutate is not absorbed systemically. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe content of one tube covers a treatment area of 25 cm2 (e.g. 5 cm x 5 cm). The tube is for single \nuse only and should be discarded after use (see section 6.6). \n \nThe gel from the tube should be squeezed onto a fingertip and spread evenly over the entire treatment \narea, allowing it to dry for 15 minutes. The content of one tube should be used for one treatment area \nof 25 cm2.  \nFor single use only. \n \nFor treatment of the neck: \nIf more than half of the treatment area is located in the upper part of the neck, Picato 150 mcg/g gel \nshould be used at the posology for face and scalp. If more than half of the treatment area is located in \nthe lower part of the neck, Picato 500 mcg/g gel should be used at the posology for trunk and \nextremities. \n \nIf an area on the face or scalp and another area on the trunk or extremities are simultaneously treated, \nthen patients should be advised to ensure they use the appropriate strengths. Care should be exercised \nnot to apply the Picato 500 mcg/g gel on the face or scalp as this could lead to a higher incidence of \nlocal skin responses. \n \nPatients should be instructed to wash their hands with soap and water, immediately after applying \nPicato and between topical applications if two different areas require different strengths. If treating the \nhands, only the fingertip which is used for applying the gel should be washed. \nWashing and touching the treated area should be avoided for a period of 6 hours after application of \nPicato. After this period, the treatment area may be washed using mild soap and water. \n \nPicato should not be applied immediately after taking a shower or less than 2 hours before bedtime. \n \nThe treated area should not be covered with occlusive bandages after Picato is applied. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEye exposure \nContact with the eyes can cause chemical conjunctivitis and corneal burns. Patients should wash their \nhands thoroughly after applying the gel and following any contact with the treated area, to avoid \ninadvertent transfer of the gel to the eyes. If accidental exposure occurs, the eyes should be flushed \nimmediately with large amounts of water, and the patient should seek medical care as soon as possible. \nEye disorders such as eye pain, eyelid oedema and periorbital oedema should be expected to occur \nafter accidental eye exposure of Picato (see section 4.8). \n \nIngestion \nPicato must not be ingested. If accidental ingestion occurs the patient should drink plenty of water and \nseek medical care.  \n \nGeneral \nAdministration of Picato is not recommended until the skin is healed from treatment with any previous \nmedicinal product or surgical treatment and should not be applied to open wounds or damaged skin \nwhere the skin barrier is compromised. \nPicato should not be used near the eyes, on the inside of the nostrils, on the inside of the ears or on the \nlips. \n \nLocal skin responses \nLocal skin responses such as erythema, flaking/scaling, and crusting should be expected to occur after \ncutaneous application of Picato (see section 4.8). Localised skin responses are transient and typically \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\noccur within 1 day of treatment initiation and peak in intensity up to 1 week following completion of \ntreatment. Localised skin responses typically resolve within 2 weeks of treatment initiation when \ntreating areas on the face and scalp and within 4 weeks of treatment initiation when treating areas on \nthe trunk and extremities. Treatment effect may not be adequately assessed until resolution of local \nskin responses. \n \nSun exposure \nStudies have been conducted to assess the effects of UV irradiation of the skin following single and \nmultiple applications of ingenol mebutate gel, 100 mcg/g. Ingenol mebutate gel did not demonstrate \nany potential for photo irritation or photo allergic effects. However, due to the nature of the disease, \nexcessive exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps and tanning beds) should be avoided or \nminimised.  \n \nKeratoacanthoma, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen\u2019s disease, squamous cell carcinoma \nReports of keratoacanthoma, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen\u2019s disease, squamous cell carcinoma \noccurring within the treatment area with a time to onset ranging from weeks to months following use \nof ingenol mebutate gel have been received from a post-authorisation clinical trial (see section 5.1) \nand post-marketing. Ingenol mebutate should be used with caution in patients with a history of \ncutaneous malignancy. Health care professionals should advise patients to be vigilant for any lesions \ndeveloping within the treatment area and to seek medical advice immediately should any occur. \n \nManagement of actinic keratosis \nLesions clinically atypical for actinic keratosis or suspicious for malignancy should be biopsied to \ndetermine appropriate treatment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Interactions with systemically absorbed medicinal \nproducts are considered unlikely as Picato is not absorbed systemically. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of ingenol mebutate in pregnant women. Animal studies showed slight \nembryo-fetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Risks to humans receiving cutaneous treatment with ingenol \nmebutate are considered unlikely as Picato is not absorbed systemically. As a precautionary measure, \nit is preferable to avoid the use of Picato during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated as Picato is not absorbed systemically. The \nnursing mother should be instructed that physical contact between her newborn/infant and the treated \narea should be avoided for a period of 6 hours after application of Picato.  \n \nFertility \nNo fertility studies have been performed with ingenol mebutate. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPicato has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are local skin responses including erythema, \nflaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation and erosion/ulceration at the application \nsite of ingenol mebutate gel, see table 1 for MedDRA terms.

Patients received field treatment (area of 25 cm2) with Picato at concentrations of 150 mcg/g \nor 500 mcg/g or vehicle once daily for 3 or 2 consecutive days respectively. \n \nThe table below presents adverse reactions by MedDRA system organ class and anatomical location. \n \nFrequencies have been defined according to the following convention:  \nVery common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 \nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions by MedDRA System Organ Classification \n Frequency \nSystem Organ Class Face and scalp Trunk and extremities \nInfections and infestations \nApplication site pustules  Very common  Very common \nApplication site infection Common  \nImmune system disorders \nHypersensitivity (including \nangioedema) \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache Common   \nEye disorders* \nEye lid oedema Common   \nPeriorbital oedema  Common  \nChemical conjunctivitis, corneal \nburn** \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nEye pain Uncommon  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nApplication site erosion Very common  Very common \nApplication site vesicles  Very common Very common \nApplication site swelling  Very common Very common \nApplication site exfoliation Very common  Very common \nApplication site scab  Very common Very common  \nApplication site erythema Very common  Very common \nApplication site pain*** Very common  Common  \nApplication site pruritus  Common  Common  \nApplication site irritation  Common  Common \nApplication site discharge Uncommon  \nApplication site paraesthesia  Uncommon  Uncommon \nApplication site ulcer  Uncommon Uncommon \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nApplication site pigmentation \nchanges \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nApplication site warmth   Uncommon \nApplication site scarring Rare Rare \n*: Application site swelling on the face or scalp may gravitate to the eye area \n**: Accidental eye exposure: Post-marketing reports of chemical conjunctivitis and corneal burn in \nconnection with accidental eye exposure have been received (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 for prevention of \neye exposure) \n***: Including application site burning. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nThe incidence of local skin responses that occurred at an incidence >1% in both the \u2018face/scalp\u2019 and \nthe \u2018trunk/extremities\u2019, respectively are: application site erythema (94% and 92%), application site \nexfoliation (85% and 90%), application site scab (80% and 74%), application site swelling (79% and \n64%), application site vesicles (13% and 20%), application site pustules (43% and 23%) and \napplication site erosion (31% and 25%). \n \nSevere local skin responses occurred with an incidence of 29% on the face and scalp and with an \nincidence of 17% on the trunk and extremities. The incidence of severe local skin responses that \noccurred at an incidence >1% in both the \u2018face/scalp\u2019 and the \u2018trunk/extremities\u2019, respectively are: \napplication site erythema (24% and 15%), application site exfoliation (9% and 8%), application site \nscab (6% and 4%), application site swelling (5% and 3%) and application site pustules (5% and 1%). \n \nLong-term follow up \nA total of 198 patients with complete clearance at day 57 (184 treated with Picato and 14 treated with \nvehicle) were followed for additionally 12 months. In another study, 329 patients who were initially \ntreated with cryotherapy on the face/scalp were randomised after three weeks to either Picato \n150 mcg/g (n=158) or vehicle (n=150) for 3 days in the same area. 149 patients in the Picato group \nand 140 in the vehicle group were followed for 12 months. In a later study 450 patients were initially \ntreated with Picato 150 mcg/g, of these 134 patients were randomised to a second treatment course of \nPicato 150 mcg/g and the patients followed for up to 12 months after the first treatment.  \nThese results did not change the safety profile of Picato (see section 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdosing of Picato could result in an increased incidence of local skin responses. Management of \noverdose should consist of treatment of clinical symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibiotics and chemotherapeutics for dermatological use, other \nchemotherapeutics, ATC code: D06BX02. \n \nMechanism of action \nThe mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate for use in actinic keratosis remains to be fully \ncharacterised. In vivo and in vitro models have shown a dual mechanism of action for the effects of \ningenol mebutate: 1) induction of local lesion cell death and 2) promoting an inflammatory response \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\ncharacterised by local production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and infiltration of \nimmunocompetent cells.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nResults from two clinical studies on biological effects of ingenol mebutate have shown that topical \nadministration induced epidermal necrosis and a profound inflammatory response in both epidermis \nand the upper dermis of the treated skin, dominated by infiltrating T cells, neutrophils and \nmacrophages. Necrosis in the dermis was rarely observed.  \nGene expression profiles of skin biopsies from the treated areas is suggestive of inflammatory \nresponses and response to wounding, which is consistent with the histology assessments. \nNon-invasive examination of the treated skin by reflectance confocal microscopy have shown that the \nskin changes induced by ingenol mebutate were reversible, with almost complete normalisation of all \nmeasured parameters on day 57 after treatment, which is supported also by clinical findings and \nstudies in animals. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of Picato 150 mcg/g, administered on the face or scalp for 3 consecutive days \nwas studied in two double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical studies including 547 adult patients. \nLikewise the efficacy and safety of Picato 500 mcg/g, administered on the trunk and extremities for 2 \nconsecutive days was studied in two double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical studies including 458 \nadult patients. Patients continued in the studies for an 8 week follow-up period during which they \nreturned for clinical observations and safety monitoring. Efficacy, measured as complete and partial \nclearance rate, as well as median percent reduction, was assessed at day 57 (see table 2). \n \nPatients had 4 to 8 clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic, actinic \nkeratosis lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the face or scalp or on the trunk or \nextremities. On each scheduled dosing day, the study gel was applied to the entire treatment area. \nThe compliance rate was high, with 98% of the patients completing these studies. \nStudy patients ranged from 34 to 89 years of age (mean 64 and 66 years, respectively, for the two \nstrengths) and 94% had Fitzpatrick skin type I, II, or III. \n \nAt day 57, patients treated with Picato had higher complete and partial clearance rates than patients \ntreated with vehicle gel (p<0.001). The median percent reduction in actinic keratosis lesions was \nhigher in the group treated with ingenol mebutate compared to the vehicle group (see table 2).  \n \nTable 2 Rates of subjects with complete and partial clearance and median percent (%) lesion \nreduction in actinic keratosis \n Face and scalp Trunk and extremities \n Picato  \n\n150 mcg/g \n(n=277 ) \n\nVehicle \n(n=270 ) \n\nPicato \n500 mcg/g \n(n=226 ) \n\nVehicle \n(n=232 ) \n\nComplete Clearance Ratea 42.2%d 3.7% 34.1%d 4.7% \n\nPartial Clearance Rateb (\u2265 75%) 63.9% d 7.4% 49.1% d 6.9% \n\nMedian % Reductionc 83% 0% 75% 0% \n\na Complete clearance rate was defined as the proportion of patients with no (zero) clinically visible actinic \nkeratosis lesions in the treatment area.  \nb Partial clearance rate was defined as the percentage of patients in whom 75% or more of the number of \nbaseline actinic keratosis lesions were cleared.  \nc Median percent (%) reduction in actinic keratosis lesions compared to baseline. \nd p<0.001; compared to vehicle by logistic regression with treatment, study and anatomical location. \n \nThe level of efficacy varied between the individual anatomical locations.

Higher mean patient global satisfaction \nscores, indicating a higher level of overall satisfaction, were seen in the ingenol mebutate groups \ncompared to the vehicle groups (p<0.001) as measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire \nfor Medication (TSQM). \n \nLong term efficacy  \nThree prospective, observational long term 1 year follow-up studies were conducted to evaluate \nsustained efficacy by recurrence of actinic keratosis lesions in the treatment field, and safety in \npatients who had received treatment with Picato. One study included patients treated with Picato \n150 mcg/g on the face or scalp for 3 days and two studies included patients treated with Picato \n500 mcg/g on the trunk or extremities for 2 days. Only those patients who achieved complete \nclearance in the treated area at the end of the phase 3 studies (day 57) were eligible for long term \nfollow-up. Patients were followed every 3 months for 12 months (see table 5). \n \nTable 5 Rate of recurrence of actinic keratosis lesions  \n Picato \n\n150 mcg/g gel \nFace and scalp \n\nPicato \n500 mcg/g gel \n\nTrunk and extremities \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n(n=108 ) (n=76c ) \nRecurrence Rate 12 months \nKM estimate (95% CI)a \n\n53.9% (44.6-63.7) 56.0% (45.1-67.6) \n\nLesion Based Recurrence Rateb 12 months \nMean (SD) \n\n12.8% (19.1) 13.2% (23.0) \n\na The recurrence rate is the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate at the target study date of the visit expressed as a \npercentage (95% CI).

The trial included a large group of severely sun-damaged patients. 12/163 \nsubjects treated with an investigational product of ingenol mebutate reported 16 skin tumour events \ninside the treatment area (1 SCC, 1 Bowen's disease and 14 keratoacanthoma following centralised \npathology review) compared to 0/61 in the vehicle group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Picato \nin all subsets of the paediatric population in actinic keratosis (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \nElderly population \nOf the 1,165 patients treated with Picato in the actinic keratosis clinical studies conducted with ingenol \nmebutate gel, 656 patients (56%) were 65 years and older, while 241 patients (21%) were 75 years and \nolder. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between younger and older patients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe systemic pharmacokinetic profile of ingenol mebutate and its metabolites has not been \ncharacterised in humans due to the absence of quantifiable whole blood levels following cutaneous \nadministration.   \n \nAbsorption \nNo systemic absorption was detected at or above the lower limit of detection (0.1 ng/mL) when Picato \n500 mcg/g from 4 tubes was applied to an area of 100 cm2 on the dorsal forearm in actinic keratosis \npatients once daily for 2 consecutive days. \n \nIn vitro study results demonstrate that ingenol mebutate does not inhibit or induce human cytochrome \nP450 isoforms.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nThe non-clinical safety studies demonstrate that cutaneous administration of ingenol mebutate gel is \nwell tolerated with any skin irritation being reversible and a negligible risk of systemic toxicity under \nthe recommended conditions of use. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nIn rats, ingenol mebutate was not associated with fetal developmental effects at IV doses up to \n5 mcg/kg/day (30 mcg/m2/day).

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPicato 500 micrograms/gram gel \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach gram of gel contains 500 mcg of ingenol mebutate. Each tube contains 235 mcg of ingenol \nmebutate in 0.47 g of gel. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGel. \nClear colourless gel. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPicato is indicated for the cutaneous treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic \nkeratosis in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nActinic keratosis on the trunk and extremities in adults \nOne tube of Picato 500 mcg/g gel (containing 235 mcg ingenol mebutate) should be applied once daily \nto the affected area for 2 consecutive days. \n \nOptimal therapeutic effect can be assessed approximately 8 weeks after treatment. \n \nA repeat treatment course of Picato can be given if an incomplete response is seen at a follow-up \nexamination after 8 weeks or if lesions that are cleared at this examination recur in subsequent \nexaminations. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Picato in the paediatric population.  \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.1). \n \nImmunocompromised patients \nClinical data on treatment in immunocompromised patients is not available, but systemic risks are not \nexpected since ingenol mebutate is not absorbed systemically. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nThe content of one tube covers a treatment area of 25 cm2 (e.g. 5 cm x 5 cm). The tube is for single \nuse only and should be discarded after use (see section 6.6). \n \nThe gel from the tube should be squeezed onto a fingertip and spread evenly over the entire treatment \narea, allowing it to dry for 15 minutes. The content of one tube should be used for one treatment area \nof 25 cm2.  \nFor single use only. \n \nFor treatment of the neck:  \nIf more than half of the treatment area is located in the upper part of the neck, Picato 150 mcg/g gel \nshould be used at the posology for face and scalp. If more than half of the treatment area is located in \nthe lower part of the neck, Picato 500 mcg/g gel should be used at the posology for trunk and \nextremities. \n \nIf an area on the face or scalp and another area on the trunk or extremities are simultaneously treated, \nthen patients should be advised to ensure they use the appropriate strengths. Care should be exercised \nnot to apply the Picato 500 mcg/g gel on the face or scalp as this could lead to a higher incidence of \nlocal skin responses. \n \nPatients should be instructed to wash their hands with soap and water, immediately after applying \nPicato, and between topical applications if two different areas require different strengths. If treating \nthe hands, only the fingertip which is used for applying the gel should be washed. \nWashing and touching the treated area should be avoided for a period of 6 hours after application of \nPicato. After this period, the treatment area may be washed using mild soap and water. \n \nPicato should not be applied immediately after taking a shower or less than 2 hours before bedtime. \n \nThe treated area should not be covered with occlusive bandages after Picato is applied. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEye exposure \nContact with the eyes can cause chemical conjunctivitis and corneal burns. Patients should wash their \nhands thoroughly after applying the gel and following any contact with the treated area, to avoid \ninadvertent transfer of the gel to the eyes. If accidental exposure occurs, the eyes should be flushed \nimmediately with large amounts of water, and the patient should seek medical care as soon as possible. \nEye disorders such as eye pain, eyelid oedema and periorbital oedema should be expected to occur \nafter accidental eye exposure of Picato (see section 4.8). \n \nIngestion \nPicato must not be ingested. If accidental ingestion occurs the patient should drink plenty of water and \nseek medical care.  \n \nGeneral \nAdministration of Picato is not recommended until the skin is healed from treatment with any previous \nmedicinal product or surgical treatment and should not be applied to open wounds or damaged skin \nwhere the skin barrier is compromised. \nPicato should not be used near the eyes, on the inside of the nostrils, on the inside of the ears or on the \nlips. \n \nLocal skin responses \nLocal skin responses such as erythema, flaking/scaling, and crusting should be expected to occur after \ncutaneous application of Picato (see section 4.8). Localised skin responses are transient and typically \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\noccur within 1 day of treatment initiation and peak in intensity up to 1 week following completion of \ntreatment. Localised skin responses typically resolve within 2 weeks of treatment initiation when \ntreating areas on the face and scalp and within 4 weeks of treatment initiation when treating areas on \nthe trunk and extremities. Treatment effect may not be adequately assessed until resolution of local \nskin responses. \n \nSun exposure \nStudies have been conducted to assess the effects of UV irradiation of the skin following single and \nmultiple applications of ingenol mebutate gel, 100 mcg/g. Ingenol mebutate gel did not demonstrate \nany potential for photo irritation or photo allergic effects. However, due to the nature of the disease, \nexcessive exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps and tanning beds) should be avoided or \nminimised.  \n \nKeratoacanthoma, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen\u2019s disease, squamous cell carcinoma \nReports of keratoacanthoma, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen\u2019s disease, squamous cell carcinoma \noccurring within the treatment area with a time to onset ranging from weeks to months following use \nof ingenol mebutate gel have been received from a post-authorisation clinical trial (see section 5.1) \nand post-marketing. Ingenol mebutate should be used with caution in patients with a history of \ncutaneous malignancy. Health care professionals should advise patients to be vigilant for any lesions \ndeveloping within the treatment area and to seek medical advice immediately should any occur. \n \nManagement of actinic keratosis \nLesions clinically atypical for actinic keratosis or suspicious for malignancy should be biopsied to \ndetermine appropriate treatment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Interactions with systemically absorbed medicinal \nproducts are considered unlikely as Picato is not absorbed systemically. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of ingenol mebutate in pregnant women. Animal studies showed slight \nembryo-fetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Risks to humans receiving cutaneous treatment with ingenol \nmebutate are considered unlikely as Picato is not absorbed systemically. As a precautionary measure, \nit is preferable to avoid the use of Picato during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated as Picato is not absorbed systemically. The \nnursing mother should be instructed that physical contact between her newborn/infant and the treated \narea should be avoided for a period of 6 hours after application of Picato.  \n \nFertility \nNo fertility studies have been performed with ingenol mebutate. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPicato has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are local skin responses including erythema, \nflaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation and erosion/ulceration at the application \nsite of ingenol mebutate gel, see table 1 for MedDRA terms.

Patients received field treatment (area of 25 cm2) with Picato at concentrations of 150 mcg/g \nor 500 mcg/g or vehicle once daily for 3 or 2 consecutive days respectively. \n \nThe table below presents adverse reactions by MedDRA system organ class and anatomical location. \n \nFrequencies have been defined according to the following convention:  \nVery common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 \nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions by MedDRA System Organ Classification \n Frequency \nSystem Organ Class Face and scalp Trunk and extremities \nInfections and infestations \nApplication site pustules  Very common  Very common \nApplication site infection Common  \nImmune system disorders \nHypersensitivity (including \nangioedema) \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache Common   \nEye disorders* \nEye lid oedema Common   \nPeriorbital oedema  Common  \nChemical conjunctivitis, corneal \nburn** \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nEye pain Uncommon  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nApplication site erosion Very common  Very common \nApplication site vesicles  Very common Very common \nApplication site swelling  Very common Very common \nApplication site exfoliation Very common  Very common \nApplication site scab  Very common Very common  \nApplication site erythema Very common  Very common \nApplication site pain*** Very common  Common  \nApplication site pruritus  Common  Common  \nApplication site irritation  Common  Common \nApplication site discharge Uncommon  \nApplication site paraesthesia  Uncommon  Uncommon \nApplication site ulcer  Uncommon Uncommon \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nApplication site pigmentation \nchanges \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nApplication site warmth   Uncommon \nApplication site scarring Rare Rare \n*: Application site swelling on the face or scalp may gravitate to the eye area \n**: Accidental eye exposure: Post-marketing reports of chemical conjunctivitis and corneal burn in \nconnection with accidental eye exposure have been received (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 for prevention of \neye exposure) \n***: Including application site burning. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nThe incidence of local skin responses that occurred at an incidence >1% in both the \u2018face/scalp\u2019 and \nthe \u2018trunk/extremities\u2019, respectively are: application site erythema (94% and 92%), application site \nexfoliation (85% and 90%), application site scab (80% and 74%), application site swelling (79% and \n64%), application site vesicles (13% and 20%), application site pustules (43% and 23%) and \napplication site erosion (31% and 25%). \n \nSevere local skin responses occurred with an incidence of 29% on the face and scalp and with an \nincidence of 17% on the trunk and extremities. The incidence of severe local skin responses that \noccurred at an incidence >1% in both the \u2018face/scalp\u2019 and the \u2018trunk/extremities\u2019, respectively are: \napplication site erythema (24% and 15%), application site exfoliation (9% and 8%), application site \nscab (6% and 4%), application site swelling (5% and 3%) and application site pustules (5% and 1%). \n \nLong-term follow up \nA total of 198 patients with complete clearance at day 57 (184 treated with Picato and 14 treated with \nvehicle) were followed for additionally 12 months. In another study, 329 patients who were initially \ntreated with cryotherapy on the face/scalp were randomised after three weeks to either Picato \n150 mcg/g (n=158) or vehicle (n=150) for 3 days in the same area. 149 patients in the Picato group \nand 140 in the vehicle group were followed for 12 months. In a later study 450 patients were initially \ntreated with Picato 150 mcg/g, of these 134 patients were randomised to a second treatment course of \nPicato 150 mcg/g and the patients followed for up to 12 months after the first treatment.  \nThese results did not change the safety profile of Picato (see section 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdosing of Picato could result in an increased incidence of local skin responses. Management of \noverdose should consist of treatment of clinical symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibiotics and chemotherapeutics for dermatological use, other \nchemotherapeutics, ATC code: D06BX02. \n \nMechanism of action \nThe mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate for use in actinic keratosis remains to be fully \ncharacterised. In vivo and in vitro models have shown a dual mechanism of action for the effects of \ningenol mebutate: 1) induction of local lesion cell death and 2) promoting an inflammatory response \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\ncharacterised by local production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and infiltration of \nimmunocompetent cells.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nResults from two clinical studies on biological effects of ingenol mebutate have shown that topical \nadministration induced epidermal necrosis and a profound inflammatory response in both epidermis \nand the upper dermis of the treated skin, dominated by infiltrating T cells, neutrophils and \nmacrophages. Necrosis in the dermis was rarely observed.  \nGene expression profiles of skin biopsies from the treated areas is suggestive of inflammatory \nresponses and response to wounding, which is consistent with the histology assessments. \nNon-invasive examination of the treated skin by reflectance confocal microscopy have shown that the \nskin changes induced by ingenol mebutate were reversible, with almost complete normalisation of all \nmeasured parameters on day 57 after treatment, which is supported also by clinical findings and \nstudies in animals. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of Picato 150 mcg/g, administered on the face or scalp for 3 consecutive days \nwas studied in two double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical studies including 547 adult patients. \nLikewise the efficacy and safety of Picato 500 mcg/g, administered on the trunk and extremities for 2 \nconsecutive days was studied in two double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical studies including 458 \nadult patients. Patients continued in the studies for an 8 week follow-up period during which they \nreturned for clinical observations and safety monitoring. Efficacy, measured as complete and partial \nclearance rate, as well as median percent reduction, was assessed at day 57 (see table 2). \n \nPatients had 4 to 8 clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic, actinic \nkeratosis lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the face or scalp or on the trunk or \nextremities. On each scheduled dosing day, the study gel was applied to the entire treatment area. \nThe compliance rate was high, with 98% of the patients completing these studies. \nStudy patients ranged from 34 to 89 years of age (mean 64 and 66 years, respectively, for the two \nstrengths) and 94% had Fitzpatrick skin type I, II, or III. \n \nAt day 57, patients treated with Picato had higher complete and partial clearance rates than patients \ntreated with vehicle gel (p<0.001). The median percent reduction in actinic keratosis lesions was \nhigher in the group treated with ingenol mebutate compared to the vehicle group (see table 2).  \n \nTable 2 Rates of subjects with complete and partial clearance and median percent (%) lesion \nreduction in actinic keratosis  \n Face and scalp Trunk and extremities \n Picato  \n\n150 mcg/g \n(n=277 ) \n\nVehicle \n(n=270 ) \n\nPicato \n500 mcg/g \n(n=226 ) \n\nVehicle \n(n=232 ) \n\nComplete Clearance Ratea 42.2%d 3.7% 34.1%d 4.7% \n\nPartial Clearance Rateb (\u2265 75%) 63.9% d 7.4% 49.1% d 6.9% \n\nMedian % Reductionc 83% 0% 75% 0% \n\na Complete clearance rate was defined as the proportion of patients with no (zero) clinically visible actinic \nkeratosis lesions in the treatment area.  \nb Partial clearance rate was defined as the percentage of patients in whom 75% or more of the number of \nbaseline actinic keratosis lesions were cleared.  \nc Median percent (%) reduction in actinic keratosis lesions compared to baseline. \nd p<0.001; compared to vehicle by logistic regression with treatment, study and anatomical location. \n \nThe level of efficacy varied between the individual anatomical locations.

One study included patients treated with Picato \n150 mcg/g on the face or scalp for 3 days and two studies included patients treated with Picato \n500 mcg/g on the trunk or extremities for 2 days. Only those patients who achieved complete \nclearance in the treated area at the end of the phase 3 studies (day 57) were eligible for long term \nfollow-up.

Recurrence was defined as any identified actinic keratosis lesion in the previously \ntreated area for patients who achieved complete clearance at day 57 in the previous phase 3 studies. \nb The lesion-based recurrence rate for each patient defined as the ratio of the number of actinic keratosis \nlesions at 12 months to the number of lesions at baseline in the previous phase 3 studies. \nc Of these, 38 subjects were previously treated in a vehicle controlled phase 3 study and 38 subjects were \npreviously treated in an uncontrolled phase 3 study. \n \nRisk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma \nAt end of study (day 57), the rate of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported in the treatment area \nwas comparable in patients treated with ingenol mebutate gel (0.3%, 3 of 1,165 patients) and in \nvehicle treated patients (0.3%, 2 of 632 patients) in the actinic keratosis clinical studies conducted \nwith ingenol mebutate gel.  \n \nSCC in the treatment area was reported in no patients (0 of 184 patients previously treated with \ningenol mebutate gel) in the three prospective, observational long term 1 year follow-up studies.  \n \nExperience with more than one treatment course \nIn a double blind, vehicle-controlled study, up to two treatment courses of Picato 150 mcg/g were \nadministered to 450 patients with 4-8 AKs in a 25 cm2 treatment area on the face or scalp. Patients, in \nwhom a first treatment course did not lead to complete clearance of all AKs in the treatment area after \n8 weeks, were randomised to another treatment course with Picato or vehicle. Patients in whom the \nfirst treatment course led to complete clearance were seen at 26 and 44 weeks and randomised to a \nsecond treatment course if they had a recurrence in the field. In all patients, assessment of efficacy was \n8 weeks after the randomisation. The first treatment course, given open label, resulted in a complete \nclearance rate of 62% (277/450).

At \n12 months, the complete clearance rates in these groups were 31% and 19% respectively. The percent \nreduction of the AK count in the Picato group was 83% at 11 weeks and 57% at 12 months, where in \nthe vehicle group it was 78% at 11 weeks and 42% at 12 months. The mean number of AKs in the \nPicato group was 5.7 at baseline, 0.8 at week 11, and 0.9 at month 12 as opposed to 5.8, 1.0 and 1.2 in \nthe vehicle group at these time points. \nSafety results from the study were comparable to the safety profile of Picato gel, 150 mcg/g as \nmonotherapy \n \nExperience with treatment of a larger area \nIn a double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate systemic exposure, Picato 500 mcg/g, from 4 \ntubes, was applied to a 100 cm2 contiguous treatment area daily for 2 consecutive days. Results \ndemonstrated no systemic absorption.  \nPicato 500 mcg/g was well tolerated when applied to a contiguous treatment area of 100 cm2 on the \ntrunk and extremities. \n \nIn a double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in patients with AK on trunk and extremities, an \ninvestigational product with ingenol mebutate gel 600 mcg/g was applied once daily for 2, 3, or 4 days \nto a skin area of 250 cm2. The trial included a large group of severely sun-damaged patients. 12/163 \nsubjects treated with an investigational product of ingenol mebutate reported 16 skin tumour events \ninside the treatment area (1 SCC, 1 Bowen's disease and 14 keratoacanthoma following centralised \npathology review) compared to 0/61 in the vehicle group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Picato \nin all subsets of the paediatric population in actinic keratosis (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \nElderly population \nOf the 1,165 patients treated with Picato in the actinic keratosis clinical studies conducted with ingenol \nmebutate gel, 656 patients (56%) were 65 years and older, while 241 patients (21%) were 75 years and \nolder. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between younger and older patients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe systemic pharmacokinetic profile of ingenol mebutate and its metabolites has not been \ncharacterised in humans due to the absence of quantifiable whole blood levels following cutaneous \nadministration.   \n \nAbsorption \nNo systemic absorption was detected at or above the lower limit of detection (0.1 ng/mL) when Picato \n500 mcg/g from 4 tubes was applied to an area of 100 cm2 on the dorsal forearm in actinic keratosis \npatients once daily for 2 consecutive days. \n \nIn vitro study results demonstrate that ingenol mebutate does not inhibit or induce human cytochrome \nP450 isoforms.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nThe non-clinical safety studies demonstrate that cutaneous administration of ingenol mebutate gel is \nwell tolerated with any skin irritation being reversible and a negligible risk of systemic toxicity under \nthe recommended conditions of use. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nIn rats, ingenol mebutate was not associated with fetal developmental effects at IV doses up to \n5 mcg/kg/day (30 mcg/m2/day).

What Picato is and what it is used for \n \nPicato contains the active substance ingenol mebutate. \nThis medicine is used for topical (on the skin) treatment of actinic keratosis, also called solar keratosis, \nin adults. Actinic keratoses are rough areas of skin found in people who have been exposed to too \nmuch sunshine over the course of their lifetime. Picato 150 micrograms/gram gel is used for actinic \nkeratosis on the face and scalp. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Picato  \n \nDo not use Picato   \n- If you are allergic to ingenol mebutate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Picato. \n- Do not get Picato in your eyes. Wash your hands thoroughly after you have applied the gel. \n\nWash your hands again if you happen to touch the area where you applied the gel. Take care not \nto transfer gel from the treatment area into your eyes. In the event of accidental contact, remove \nthe gel by rinsing with plenty of water and seek medical assistance as soon as possible. \n\n- Do not swallow this medicine. Drink plenty of water if you accidentally swallow this medicine \nand seek medical assistance. \n\n- Make sure that your skin has healed from any other treatments or surgery before using this \nmedicine. Do not apply Picato on open-wounds or damaged skin. \n\n- Do not apply this medicine internally, to the area near the eyes, to the inside of the nostrils, the \ninside of the ear or on the lips. \n\n- Avoid sunlight as much as possible (including sunlamps and tanning beds). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\n- Be vigilant for any new scaly red patches, open sores, elevated or warty growths within the \ntreatment area. Should any occur, talk to your doctor immediately. \n\n- This medicine is intended to treat one area of 25 cm2 for three days. \n- Do not apply more gel than your doctor has advised. \n- You should expect to get local skin reactions, such as reddening and swelling, after treatment \n\nwith this medicine (see section 4). Contact your doctor if these local skin reactions get severe. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nActinic keratosis does not occur in children, and this medicine must not be used in children and \nadolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Picato \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nIf you have previously used Picato or other similar medicines tell your doctor before starting the \ntreatment.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. You should avoid the use of Picato if you are \npregnant. \nIf you are breast-feeding, avoid physical contact between the baby and the treated area for 6 hours \nafter application of this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine does not have any effect on your ability to drive or to use machines.  \n \n \n3. How to use Picato \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nIf you have been prescribed two different strengths for treatment of two different areas you should \nmake sure that you use the prescribed strength on the correct area.

The PRAC is of the opinion that a thorough review is \nneeded of the impact of all available data related to skin malignancies, including the results of study \nLP0041-63, on the benefit risk balance of Picato. Additionally, the product information should be \nvaried concerning ingenol mebutate use and the risk of skin malignancy. The PRAC also agreed that \na DHPC is needed in order to mitigate this risk. \n\n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for ingenol mebutate the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ingenol mebutate is unchanged subject \nto the proposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
