NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nReplagal 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 1 mg of agalsidase alfa*. \nEach vial of 3.5 ml of concentrate contains 3.5 mg of agalsidase alfa. \n \n*agalsidase alfa is the human protein \u03b1-galactosidase A produced in a human cell line by genetic \nengineering technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \nA clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReplagal is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed \ndiagnosis of Fabry Disease (\u03b1-galactosidase A deficiency).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nReplagal treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients \nwith Fabry Disease or other inherited metabolic diseases.   \n \nPosology \nReplagal is administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight every other week by intravenous infusion \nover 40 minutes.  \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly patients \nStudies in patients over the age of 65 have not been performed and no dosage regimen can presently \nbe recommended in these patients as safety and efficacy have not yet been established. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. \n \nThe presence of extensive renal damage (eGFR <60mL/min) may limit the renal response to enzyme \nreplacement therapy. Limited data are available in patients on dialysis or post-kidney transplantation, \nno dose adjustment is recommended. \n \nPaediatric Population \nThe safety and efficacy of Replagal in children aged 0-6 years has not yet been established. Currently \navailable data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on posology can be made. \n \n\n2 \n\n\n\nIn clinical studies of children (7-18 years) who received Replagal 0.2 mg/kg every other week, no \nunexpected safety issues were encountered (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nAdminister the infusion solution over a period of 40 minutes using an intravenous line with an integral \nfilter.  \n \nDo not infuse Replagal concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIdiosyncratic infusion related reactions \n13.7% of adult patients treated with Replagal in clinical trials have experienced idiosyncratic infusion \nrelated reactions. Four of 17 (23.5%) paediatric patients \u22657 years of age enrolled in clinical trials \nexperienced at least one infusion reaction over a period of 4.5 years of treatment (mean duration of \napprox. 4 years). Three of 8 (37.5%) paediatric patients <7 years of age experienced at least one \ninfusion related reaction over a mean observation time of 4.2 years. The most common symptoms \nhave been rigors, headache, nausea, pyrexia, flushing and fatigue. Serious infusion reactions have been \nreported uncommonly; symptoms reported include pyrexia, rigors, tachycardia, urticaria, \nnausea/vomiting, angioneurotic oedema with throat tightness, stridor and swollen tongue. Other \ninfusion-related symptoms may include dizziness and hyperhidrosis. A review of cardiac events \nshowed that infusion reactions may be associated with hemodynamic stress triggering cardiac events \nin patients with pre-existing cardiac manifestations of Fabry disease.  \n \nThe onset of infusion related reactions has generally occurred within the first 2-4 months after \ninitiation of treatment with Replagal although later onset (after 1 year) has been reported as well. \nThese effects have decreased with time. If mild or moderate acute infusion reactions occur, medical \nattention must be sought immediately and appropriate actions instituted. The infusion can be \ntemporarily interrupted (5 to 10 minutes) until symptoms subside and the infusion may then be \nrestarted. Mild and transient effects may not require medical treatment or discontinuation of the \ninfusion. In addition, oral or intravenous pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids, \nfrom 1 to 24 hours prior to infusion may prevent subsequent reactions in those cases where \nsymptomatic treatment was required. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported. If severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions \noccur, the administration of Replagal should be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment \ninitiated. The current medical standards for emergency treatment are to be observed. \n \nAntibodies to the protein \nAs with all protein pharmaceutical products, patients may develop antibodies to the protein. A low \ntitre IgG antibody response has been observed in approximately 24% of the male patients treated with \nReplagal. Based on limited data this percentage has been found to be lower (7%) in the male paediatric \npopulation. These IgG antibodies appeared to develop following approximately 3-12 months of \ntreatment. After 12 to 54 months of therapy, 17% of Replagal treated patients were still antibody \npositive whereas 7% showed evidence for the development of immunologic tolerance, based on the \ndisappearance of IgG antibodies over time. The remaining 76% were antibody negative throughout. In \npaediatric patients >7 yrs of age, 1/16 male patients tested positive for IgG anti-agalsidase alfa \nantibodies during the study. No increase in the incidence of adverse events was detected for this \npatient. In paediatric patients <7 yrs of age, 0/7 male patients tested positive for IgG anti-agalsidase \n\n3 \n\n\n\nalfa antibodies. Borderline IgE antibody positivity not associated with anaphylaxis has been reported \nin clinical trials in a very limited number of patients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe presence of extensive renal damage may limit the renal response to enzyme replacement therapy, \npossibly due to underlying irreversible pathological changes. In such cases, the loss of renal function \nremains within the expected range of the natural progression of disease. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nReplagal should not be co-administered with chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin or gentamicin since \nthese substances have the potential to inhibit intra-cellular \u03b1-galactosidase activity. \n \nAs \u03b1-galactosidase A is itself an enzyme, it would be an unlikely candidate for cytochrome P450 \nmediated drug-drug interactions. In clinical studies, neuropathic pain medicinal products (such as \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin and gabapentin) were administered concurrently to most patients without \nany evidence of interaction. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is very limited data on pregnancies exposed to Replagal. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy or embryonic/fetal development when exposed \nduring organogenesis (see Section 5.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant \nwomen. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Replagal is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when \nprescribing to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \nNo effects on male fertility were seen in reproductive studies in male rats. \n \n4.6 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nReplagal has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.7 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions were infusion associated reactions, which occurred in \n13.7% of adult patients treated with Replagal in clinical trials. Most undesirable effects were mild to \nmoderate in severity. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions reported for the 177 patients treated with Replagal in clinical trials, \nincluding 21 patients with history of end stage renal disease, 24 paediatric patients (7 to 17 years of \nage) and 17 female patients, and from post-marketing spontaneous reports. Information is presented by \nsystem organ class and frequency (very common \u22651/10; common \u22651/100 to <1/10; uncommon \n\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). The adverse reactions categorized as incidence \u201cnot known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data)\u201d are derived from post-marketing spontaneous reports. Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The occurrence of an \nevent in a single patient is defined as uncommon in view of the number of patients treated. A single \npatient could be affected by several adverse reactions.  \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified for agalsidase alfa: \n \n\n4 \n\n\n\nTable 1 \nSystem organ class Adverse reaction \n Very \n\ncommon \nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n peripheral \noedema \n\n  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\nheadache dizziness, \ndysgeusia, \nneuropathic \npain, tremor, \nhypersomnia, \nhypoesthesia, \nparaesthesia \n\nparosmia  \n\nEye disorders   corneal reflex \ndecreased, \nlacrimation \nincreased \n\n  \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n  \n\n tinnitus, tinnitus \naggravated \n\n  \n \n\nCardiac disorders  \n \n\n tachycardia, \npalpitations \n\n cardiac arrhythmias \n(atrial fibrillation, \nventricular \nextrasystoles, \ntachyarrhythmia), \nmyocardial \nischaemia, heart \nfailure \n\nVascular disorders  flushing hypertension  hypotension \nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders  \n\n \n\n cough, \nhoarseness, \nthroat tightness, \ndyspnoea, \nnasopharyngitis, \npharyngitis, \nthroat secretion \nincreased, \nrhinorrhoea \n\noxygen \nsaturation \ndecreased \n\n \n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nnausea diarrhoea , \nvomiting, \nabdominal \npain/discomfort \n\n  \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders  \n\n acne, erythema, \npruritus, rash, \nlivedo reticularis \n\nangioneurotic \noedema, \nurticaria \n\nhyperhidrosis \n \n\nMusculoskeletal, \nconnective tissue and \nbone disorders \n\n musculoskeletal \ndiscomfort, \nmyalgia, back \npain, limb pain, \nperipheral \nswelling, \narthralgia, joint \nswelling \n\nsensation of \nheaviness \n\n \n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Anaphylactic \nreaction, \nhypersensitivity \n\n \n\n5 \n\n\n\nTable 1 \nSystem organ class Adverse reaction \n Very \n\ncommon \nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nrigors, \npyrexia, \npain and \ndiscomfort,  \nfatigue \n\nfatigue \naggravated, \nfeeling hot, \nfeeling cold, \nasthenia, chest \npain, chest \ntightness, \ninfluenza like \nillness, injection \nsite rash, \nmalaise \n\n  \n \n\n \nSee also section 4.4. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nInfusion related reactions reported in the postmarketing setting (also see section 4.4) may include \ncardiac events such as cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular extrasystoles, \ntachyarrhythmia), myocardial ischemia, and heart failure in patients with Fabry disease involving the \nheart structures. The most common infusion related reactions were mild and include rigors, pyrexia, \nflushing, headache, nausea, dyspnea, tremor and pruritus. Infusion-related symptoms may also include \ndizziness, hyperhidrosis, hypotension, cough, vomiting and fatigue. Hypersensitivity, including \nanaphylaxis, has been reported. \n \nPatients with renal disease \nAdverse drug reactions reported in patients with history of end stage renal disease were similar to \nthose reported in the general patient population. \n \nPaediatric population \nAdverse drug reactions reported in the paediatric population (children and adolescents) were, in \ngeneral, similar to those reported in adults. However, infusion related reactions (pyrexia, dyspnoea, \nchest pain) and pain exacerbation occurred more frequently.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials doses up to 0.4 mg/kg weekly were used, and their safety profile was not different \nfrom the recommended dose of 0.2 mg/kg biweekly. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products - Enzymes.ATC code: \nA16AB03. \n \n\n6 \n\n\n\nMechanism of action \nFabry Disease is a glycosphingolipid storage disorder that is caused by deficient activity of the \nlysosomal enzyme \u03b1-galactosidase A, resulting in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3 or \nGL-3, also known as ceramidetrihexoside (CTH)), the glycosphingolipid substrate for this enzyme. \nAgalsidase alfa catalyses the hydrolysis of Gb3, cleaving a terminal galactose residue from the \nmolecule. Treatment with the enzyme has been shown to reduce accumulation of Gb3 in many cell \ntypes including endothelial and parenchymal cells. Agalsidase alfa has been produced in a human cell \nline to provide for a human glycosylation profile that can influence uptake by mannose-6-phosphate \nreceptors on the surface of target cells. The selection of 0.2 mg/kg dose (infused over 40 minutes) for \nthe registration clinical studies was intended to temporarily saturate the ability of the mannose-6-\nphosphate receptors to internalize the agalsidase alfa in the liver and allow distribution of enzyme to \nother relevant organ tissues. Data with patients indicates that at least 0.1mg/kg is required to achieve a \npharmacodynamics response. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and efficacy of Replagal was assessed in two randomised, double blind, placebo controlled \nstudies and open label extension studies, in a total of forty patients with a diagnosis of Fabry Disease \nbased on clinical and biochemical evidence. Patients received the recommended dosage of 0.2 mg/kg \nof Replagal. Twenty-five patients completed the first study and entered an extension study. After 6 \nmonths of therapy there was a significant reduction in pain in the Replagal treated patients compared \nwith placebo (p=0.021), as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (a validated pain measurement \nscale). This was associated with a significant reduction in chronic neuropathic pain medication use and \nnumber of days on pain medication. In subsequent studies, in male paediatric patients above the age of \n7, a reduction in pain was observed after 9 and 12 months of Replagal therapy compared to pre-\ntreatment baseline. This pain reduction persisted through 4 years of Replagal therapy in 9 patients (in \npatients 7 \u2013 18 years of age).   \n \nTwelve to 18 months of treatment with Replagal resulted in improvement in quality of life (QoL), as \nmeasured by validated instruments.  \n \nAfter 6 months of therapy Replagal stabilised renal function compared with a decline in placebo \ntreated patients. Kidney biopsy specimens revealed a significant increase in the fraction of normal \nglomeruli and a significant decrease in the fraction of glomeruli with mesangial widening in patients \ntreated with Replagal in contrast to the patients treated with placebo. After 12 to 18 months of \nmaintenance therapy, Replagal improved renal function as measured by inulin based glomerular \nfiltration rate by 8.7 \u00b1 3.7 ml/min. (p=0.030). Longer term therapy (48-54 months) resulted in \nstabilisation of GFR in male patients with normal baseline GFR (\u2265 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and with mild \nto moderate renal dysfunction (GFR 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), and in slowing of the rate of decline \nin renal function and progression to end-stage renal disease in male Fabry patients with more severe \nrenal dysfunction (GFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). \n \nIn a second study, fifteen patients with left ventricular hypertrophy completed a 6 month placebo-\ncontrolled study and entered an extension study. Treatment with Replagal resulted in an 11.5 g \ndecrease in left ventricular mass as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the controlled \nstudy, while patients receiving placebo exhibited an increase in left ventricular mass of 21.8 g. In \naddition, in the first study involving 25 patients, Replagal effected a significant reduction in cardiac \nmass after 12 to 18 months of maintenance therapy (p<0.001). Replagal was also associated with \nimproved myocardial contractility, a decrease in mean QRS duration and a concomitant decrease in \nseptal thickness on echocardiography. Two patients with right bundle branch block in the studies \nconducted reverted to normal following therapy with Replagal. Subsequent open label studies \ndemonstrated significant reduction from baseline in left ventricular mass by echocardiography in both \nmale and female Fabry patients over 24 to 36 months of Replagal treatment. The reductions in LV \nmass observed by echocardiography in both male and female Fabry patients over 24 to 36 months of \nReplagal treatment were associated with meaningful symptom improvement as measured using the \nNYHA and CCS in Fabry patients with severe heart failure or anginal symptoms at baseline. \n \n\n7 \n\n\n\nCompared with placebo, treatment with Replagal also reduced accumulation of Gb3. After the first 6 \nmonths of therapy mean decreases of approximately 20 - 50 % were observed in plasma, urine \nsediment, liver, kidney, and heart biopsy samples. After 12 to 18 months treatment a reduction of 50 \u2013 \n80% was observed in plasma and urine sediment. The metabolic effects were also associated with \nclinically significant weight gain, increased sweating and increased energy. Consistent with the \nclinical effects of Replagal, treatment with the enzyme reduced accumulation of Gb3 in many cell \ntypes, including renal glomerular and tubular epithelial cells, renal capillary endothelial cells (cardiac \nand dermal capillary endothelial cells were not examined) and cardiac myocytes. In male paediatric \nFabry patients plasma Gb3 decreased 40-50% after 6 months of Replagal therapy 0.2 mg/kg and this \nreduction persisted after a total 4 years of treatment in 11 patients. \n \nInfusion of Replagal at home may be considered for patients who are tolerating their infusions well. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn male paediatric Fabry patients \u2265 7 years of age, hyperfiltration can be the earliest manifestation of \nrenal involvement in the disease. Reduction in their hypernormal eGFRs was observed within \n6 months of initiating Replagal therapy. After one year of treatment with agalsidase alfa 0.2 mg/kg \nevery other week, the abnormally high eGFR decreased from 143.4 \u00b1 6.8 to 121.3 \u00b1 \n5.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 in this subgroup and these eGFRs stabilized in the normal range during 4 years of \nReplagal 0.2 mg/kg therapy, as did the eGFRs of the non-hyperfiltrators. \n \nIn male paediatric patients \u2265 7 years of age, heart rate variability was abnormal at baseline and \nimproved after 6 months of Replagal therapy in 15 boys and the improvement was sustained through \n6.5 years of Replagal 0.2 mg/kg therapy in an open-label long-term extension study in 9 boys. Among \n9 boys with left ventricular mass (LVMI) indexed to height2.7 within the normal range for children \n(<39 g/m2.7 in boys) at baseline, LVMI remained stable at levels below the left ventricular hypertrophy \n(LVH) threshold throughout the 6.5 years of treatment. In a second study, in 14 patients \u2265 7 years of \nage, the results regarding heart rate variability were consistent with previous findings. In this study, \nonly one patient had LVH at baseline and remained stable over time. \n \nFor patients between 0 and 7 years of age, limited data indicate no specific safety issues. \n \nStudy in patients switching from agalsidase beta to Replagal (agalsidase alfa) \n100 patients [(na\u00efve (n=29); or previously treated with agalsidase beta who switched to Replagal \n(n=71)) were treated for up to 30 months in an open label, uncontrolled study. An analysis showed that \nserious adverse events were reported in 39.4% of those patients who switched from agalsidase beta \ncompared to 31.0% in those who were na\u00efve to therapy prior to study entry. Patients switched from \nagalsidase beta to Replagal had a safety profile consistent with that observed in other clinical \nexperience. Infusion related reactions have been  experienced by 9 patients of the na\u00efve population \n(31.0%) compared to 27 patients of the switched population (38.0%).  \n \nStudy with various dosing regimen \nIn an open\u2010label randomised study, there were no statistically significant differences between adult \npatients treated for 52 weeks with 0.2 mg/kg intravenously every other week (n=20) and those treated \nwith 0.2 mg/kg weekly (n=19) in mean change from baseline LVMI or other endpoints (cardiac \nfunctional status, renal function, and pharmacodynamic activity). In each treatment group, LVMI \nremained stable over the treatment period of the study. The overall incidence of SAEs by treatment \ngroup did not show any obvious effect of treatment regimen on the SAE profile of the different \ntreatment groups. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies to agalsidase alfa have not been shown to be associated with any clinically significant \neffects on safety (e.g. infusion reactions) or efficacy. \n \n\n8 \n\n\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle doses ranging from 0.007 - 0.2 mg enzyme per kg body weight were administered to adult male \npatients as 20 - 40 minute intravenous infusions while female patients received 0.2 mg enzyme per kg \nbody weight as 40 minute infusions. The pharmacokinetic properties were essentially unaffected by \nthe dose of the enzyme. Following a single intravenous dose of 0.2 mg/kg, agalsidase alfa had a \nbiphasic distribution and elimination profile from the circulation. Pharmacokinetic parameters were \nnot significantly different between male and female patients. Elimination half-lives were 108 \u00b1 17 \nminutes in males compared to 89 \u00b1 28 minutes in females and volume of distribution was \napproximately 17% body weight in both sexes. Clearance normalised for body weight was 2.66 and \n2.10 ml/min/kg for males and females, respectively. Based on the similarity of pharmacokinetic \nproperties of agalsidase alfa in both males and females, tissue distribution in major tissues and organs \nis also expected to be comparable in male and female patients. \n \nFollowing six months of Replagal treatment 12 of 28 male patients showed altered pharmacokinetics \nincluding an apparent increase in clearance. These changes were associated with the development of \nlow titre antibodies to agalsidase alfa but no clinically significant effects on safety or efficacy were \nobserved in the patients studied. \n \nBased on the analysis of pre- and post-dose liver biopsies in males with Fabry Disease, the tissue half-\nlife has been estimated to be in excess of 24 hours and hepatic uptake of the enzyme estimated to be \n10% of administered dose. \n \nAgalsidase alfa is a protein. It is not expected to bind to proteins. It is expected that its metabolic \ndegradation will follow the pathways of other proteins, i.e. peptide hydrolysis. Agalsidase alfa is \nunlikely to be a candidate for drug-drug interactions. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination of agalsidase alfa is considered to be a minor clearance pathway since \npharmacokinetic parameters are not altered by impaired renal function.   \n \nHepatic impairment \nAs metabolism is expected to occur by peptide hydrolysis, impaired liver function is not expected to \naffect the pharmacokinetics of agalsidase alfa in a clinically significant manner. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn children (aged 7-18 years), Replagal administered at 0.2 mg/kg was cleared faster from the \ncirculation than in adults. Mean clearance of Replagal in children aged (7-11 years), in adolescents \n(aged 12-18 years), and adults was 4.2 ml/min/kg, 3.1 ml/min/kg, and 2.3 ml/min/kg, respectively. \nPharmacodynamic data suggest that at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg Replagal, the reductions in plasma Gb3 are \nmore or less comparable between adolescents and young children (see section 5.1). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of repeated dose toxicity. \nGenotoxic and carcinogenic potential are not expected. Reproduction toxicity studies in female rats \nand rabbits have shown no effect on pregnancy or the developing foetus. No studies have been \nconducted with respect to parturition or peri/post-natal development. It is not known whether Replagal \ncrosses the placenta. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n19 \n\n\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nReplagal 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \nAgalsidase alfa \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Replagal is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Replagal \n3. How Replagal is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Replagal \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Replagal is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in Replagal is agalsidase alfa (1mg/ml). Agalsidase alfa is a form of the human \nenzyme \u03b1-galactosidase. It is produced by switching on the gene for \u03b1-galactosidase A in cells. The \nenzyme is then removed from the cells and made into a sterile concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nReplagal is used to treat adult patients, as well as adolescents and children from the age of 7, with \nconfirmed diagnosis of Fabry Disease. It is used as long-term enzyme replacement therapy when the \nlevel of enzyme in the body is absent or lower than normal as in Fabry Disease. \n \nAfter 6 months of therapy Replagal significantly reduced pain in patients when compared to placebo \n(dummy) treated patients. Replagal reduced left ventricle mass in treated patients compared to placebo \ntreated patients. These results suggest the symptoms of the disease are improving or the disease is \nbecoming stable. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before Replagal is given \n \nYou must not be given Replagal \n \n- if you are allergic to agalsidase alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before Replagal is used. \n \nIf you notice any of these effects during or after an infusion you should tell your doctor immediately: \n- high fever, chills, sweating, fast heart rate; \n- vomiting; \n- light-headedness; \n- hives; \n\n20 \n\n\n\n- swelling in your hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth or throat which may cause difficulty in \nswallowing or breathing. \n\n \nYour doctor may stop the infusion temporarily (5 \u201310 min) until the symptoms go away and then \nbegin the infusion again. \n \nYour doctor may also treat the symptoms with other medicines (antihistamines or corticosteroids). \nMost of the time you can still be given Replagal even if these symptoms occur. \n \nIf you experience a severe allergic (anaphylactic-type) reaction, the administration of Replagal will be \nimmediately discontinued and an appropriate treatment will have to be initiated by your doctor. \n \nIf treatment with Replagal makes your body produce antibodies this will not stop Replagal from \nworking and the antibodies may disappear with time. \n \nIf you have advanced renal disease, you may find that your Replagal treatment has a limited effect on \nyour kidneys. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Replagal. \n \nChildren \n \nThe experience in children 0-6 years old is limited and therefore no dose can be recommended for this \nage group. \n \nOther medicines and Replagal \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you use any medicines containing chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin or \ngentamicin. There is a theoretical risk of decreased agalsidase alfa activity. \n \nPregnancy and breast feeding \n \nVery limited clinical data on pregnancies exposed to Replagal have shown no adverse effects on the \nmother and newborn child.  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYou may drive and use machines whilst on Replagal. \n \n \n3. How Replagal is given \n \nThis medicine should be applied and supervised by appropriately trained personnel, who will also \ncalculate the dose that you will be given. \n \nThe recommended dose is an infusion of 0.2 mg for every kg you weigh. This would be about 14 mg \nor 4 vials (glass bottles) of Replagal for an average size (70 kg) individual. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nFor children and adolescents 7-18 years old a dose of 0.2 mg/kg every other week may be used. \n \n\n21 \n\n\n\nChildren and adolescents may be more likely than adults to experience an infusion related reaction. \nTell your doctor if you experience any side effects whilst having the infusion. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nReplagal has to be diluted in 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution before use. After dilution \nReplagal is given in a vein. This will usually be in your arm. \n \nThe infusion will be given every two weeks. \n \nEach time you are treated it will take 40 minutes for Replagal to be given to you in a vein. Your \ntreatment will be supervised by a doctor who specialises in the treatment of Fabry Disease. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nIf you experience a severe allergic (anaphylactic-type) reaction, the administration of Replagal will be \nimmediately discontinued and an appropriate treatment will have to be initiated by your doctor. \n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate. About 1 out of 7 patients (frequency \u201cvery common\u201d) may \nhave a reaction during or following an infusion of Replagal (infusion related reaction). These effects \ninclude chills, headache, nausea, fever, facial flushing (redness), tiredness, low blood pressure, \nunsteadiness, sweating, difficulty breathing, itching, shaking, cough and vomiting. However some \neffects may be serious and may need treatment. Infusion related reactions involving the heart \nincluding heart rhythm problems, heart muscle ischemia and heart failure, may occur in patients with \nFabry disease involving the heart structures (frequency \u201cnot known\u201d (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data)). Your doctor may stop the infusion temporarily (5 - 10 min) until the symptoms go \naway and then begin the infusion again. Your doctor may also treat the symptoms with other \nmedicines (antihistamines or corticosteroids). Most of the time you can still be given Replagal even if \nthese symptoms occur. \n \nList of other side effects: \n \nVery common:  may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n- general pain or discomfort. \n \nCommon:  may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n- tingling or numbness or pain in fingers or toes, change in the taste of food, eyes tearing, blink \n\nreflex abnormal, ears ringing, shakes, prolonged sleep \n- palpitations, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure \n- cough, chest pain or tightness, hoarseness, sore or tight throat, sticky throat secretions, runny \n\nnose, cold symptoms \n- vomiting, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhoea \n- acne, red or itchy or mottled skin, rash at the infusion site \n- back or limb pain, muscle pain, joint pain, muscle and bone discomfort, swelling of the \n\nextremities or joints \n- feeling cold or hot, flu-like symptoms, feeling sick, feeling lack of energy \n \nUncommon:  may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n- severe allergic (anaphylactic-type) reaction  \n \n\n22 \n\n\n\nChildren and adolescents \n \nSide effects reported in children were, in general, similar to those reported in adults. However, \ninfusion related reactions (fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain) and pain aggravated occurred more \nfrequently. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Replagal \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C).  \n \nDo not use Replagal if you notice that there is discolouration or other foreign particles present. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Calculate the dose and number of Replagal vials needed. \n \n2. Dilute the total volume of Replagal concentrate required in 100 ml 9 mg/ml sodium chloride \n\nsolution for infusion (0.9%w/v). Care must be taken to ensure the sterility of the prepared \nsolutions since Replagal does not contain any preservative or bacteriostatic agent; aseptic \ntechnique must be observed. Once diluted, the solution should be mixed gently but not shaken. \n\n \n3. The solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to \n\nadministration. \n \n4. Administer the infusion solution over a period of 40 minutes using an intravenous line with an \n\nintegral filter. Since no preservative is present, it is recommended that administration is started \nas soon as possible. However, the chemical and physical stability of the diluted solution has \nbeen demonstrated for 24 hours at 25\u00b0C. \n\n \n5. Do not infuse Replagal concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. \n \n6. For single use only.
