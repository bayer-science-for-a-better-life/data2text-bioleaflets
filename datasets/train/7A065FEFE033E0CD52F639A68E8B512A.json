This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO 300 mg solution for injection  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n\n \n\nOne unit (vial or pre-filled syringe) contains 300 mg of lanadelumab* in 2 mL solution. \n\n \n\n*Lanadelumab is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n\n \n\nSolution for injection  \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\nThe solution is colourless to slightly yellow, appearing either clear or slightly opalescent.  \n\n \n\nThe solution has a pH of approximately 6.0 and an osmolality of approximately 300 mOsm/kg.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) \n\nin patients aged 12 years and older.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\nmanagement of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE).  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 300 mg lanadelumab every 2 weeks. In patients who are stably \n\nattack free on treatment, a dose reduction of 300 mg lanadelumab every 4 weeks may be considered, \n\nespecially in patients with low weight. \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks (see section 4.4)  \n\n \n\nMissed doses  \n\n \n\nIf a dose of TAKHZYRO is missed, the patient should be instructed to administer the dose as soon as \n\npossible ensuring at least 10 days between doses.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nAge is not expected to affect exposure to lanadelumab. No dose adjustment is required for patients \n\nabove 65 years of age (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is not \n\nexpected to affect exposure to lanadelumab. No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted in patients with severe renal impairment. Renal impairment is not \n\nexpected to affect exposure to lanadelumab or the safety profile. No dose adjustment is required in \n\npatients with renal impairment. (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of TAKHZYRO in children aged less than 12 years have not been established. \n\nNo data are available.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is intended for subcutaneous (SC) administration only.  \n\n \n\nEach TAKHZYRO unit (vial or pre-filled syringe) is intended for single use only (see section 6.6).  \n\n \n\nThe injection should be restricted to the recommended injection sites: the abdomen, the thighs, and the \n\nupper outer arms (see section 5.2). Rotation of the injection site is recommended. \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training on SC \n\ninjection technique by a healthcare professional.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n\n \n\nTraceability  \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have been observed. In case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, \n\nadministration of TAKHZYRO must be stopped immediately and appropriate treatment must be \n\ninitiated.  \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks. In case of a breakthrough HAE \n\nattack, individualized treatment should be initiated with an approved rescue medication.  \n\n \n\nThere are no available clinical data on the use of lanadelumab in HAE patients with normal C1-INH \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nInterference with coagulation test  \n\n \n\nLanadelumab can increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of \n\nlanadelumab with the aPTT assay. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic \n\ncoagulation through the activation of plasma kallikrein in the contact system. Inhibition of plasma \n\nkallikrein by lanadelumab can increase aPTT in this assay. None of the increases in aPTT in patients \n\ntreated with TAKHZYRO were associated with abnormal bleeding adverse events. There were no \n\ndifferences in international normalised ratio (INR) between treatment groups.  \n\n \n\nSodium content  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\n'sodium-free'.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\n \n\nNo dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on the characteristics of \n\nlanadelumab, no pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered medicinal products is expected. \n\n \n\nAs expected, concomitant use of the rescue medication C1 esterase inhibitor results in an additive \n\neffect on lanadelumab-cHMWK response based on the mechanism of action (MOA) of lanadelumab \n\nand C1 esterase inhibitor (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited data from the use of lanadelumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \n\nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive or developmental toxicity (see \n\nsection 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of lanadelumab during \n\npregnancy.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether lanadelumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted \n\nin breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon \n\nafterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short period. \n\nAfterwards, lanadelumab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed. \n\n \n\nFertility  \n\n \n\nLanadelumab\u2019s effect on fertility has not been evaluated in humans. Lanadelumab had no effect on \n\nmale or female fertility in cynomolgus monkeys (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.  \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\n \n\nThe most commonly (52.4%) observed adverse reaction associated with TAKHZYRO was injection \n\nsite reactions (ISR) including injection site pain, injection site erythema and injection site bruising. Of \n\nthese ISRs, 97% were of mild intensity, 90% resolved within 1 day after onset with a median duration \n\nof 6 minutes.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was \n\nobserved (1.2%), see section 4.4.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nTable 1 summarises adverse reactions observed in the HELP study that included 84 subjects with \n\nHAE, who received at least one dose of TAKHZYRO.  \n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed in Table 1 is defined using the following convention: \n\nVery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n\n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000).  \n\n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported with lanadelumab  \n\n \n\nSystem organ class  Adverse drug reaction  Frequency  \n\nImmune system disorders  Hypersensitivity*  Common  \n\nNervous system disorders  Dizziness  Common  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  Rash maculo-papular  Common  \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders  \nMyalgia  Common  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \n\nsite conditions  \nInjection site reactions**  Very common  \n\nInvestigations  \nAlanine aminotransferase increased Common  \n\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Common  \n\n*Hypersensitivity includes: pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue.  \n\n**Injection site reactions include: pain, erythema, bruising, discomfort, haematoma, haemorrhage, \n\npruritus, swelling, induration, paraesthesia, reaction, warmth, oedema and rash.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nThe safety of TAKHZYRO was evaluated in a subgroup of 23 subjects aged 12 to <18 years old. \n\nResults of the subgroup analysis were consistent with overall study results for all subjects.  \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity  \n\n \n\nTreatment with lanadelumab has been associated with development of treatment emergent anti-drug \n\nantibodies (ADA) in 11.9% (10/84) of subjects. All antibody titres were low. The ADA response was \n\ntransient in 20% (2/10) of ADA positive subjects. 2.4% (2/84) of lanadelumab-treated subjects tested \n\npositive for neutralising antibodies.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nThe development of ADA including neutralising antibodies against TAKHZYRO did not appear to \n\nadversely affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles or clinical response.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. There is no available information to identify potential signs \n\nand symptoms of overdose. If symptoms should occur, symptomatic treatment is recommended. There \n\nis no antidote available.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, drugs used in hereditary angioedema, ATC \n\ncode: B06AC05 \n\n  \n\nMechanism of action  \n\n \n\nLanadelumab is a fully human, monoclonal antibody (IgG1/ \u03ba-light chain). Lanadelumab inhibits \n\nactive plasma kallikrein proteolytic activity. Increased plasma kallikrein activity leads to angioedema \n\nattacks in patients with HAE through the proteolysis of high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to \n\ngenerate cleaved HMWK (cHMWK) and bradykinin. Lanadelumab provides sustained control of \n\nplasma kallikrein activity and thereby limits bradykinin generation in patients with HAE.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\n \n\nConcentration-dependent inhibition of plasma kallikrein, measured as reduction of cHMWK levels, \n\nwas demonstrated after SC administration of TAKHZYRO 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every \n\n4 weeks or 300 mg every 2 weeks in subjects with HAE.  \n\n \n\nThe PK-PD relationship between TAKHZYRO and cHMWK is described by an indirect exposure-\n\nresponse pharmacological model. The cHMWK formation rate was maximally reduced by 53.7% with \n\nan IC50 of 5705 ng/ml.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\n \n\nHELP study  \n\n \n\nThe HELP study was a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study \n\nin 125 (115 adults and 10 adolescents) subjects with symptomatic type I or II HAE. Subjects were \n\nrandomised into 1 of 4 parallel treatment arms, stratified by baseline attack rate, in a 3:2:2:2 ratio \n\n(placebo, lanadelumab 150 mg every 4 weeks [q4wks], lanadelumab 300 mg every 4 weeks [q4wks], \n\nor lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks [q2wks] by SC injection) for the 26-week treatment period.  \n\n \n\nThe median (range) age of the study population was 42 (12 to 73) years with 88 female subjects \n\n(70%). A history of laryngeal angioedema attacks was reported in 65% (81/125) of subjects and \n\n56% (70/125) were on prior long-term prophylaxis (LTP). During the study run-in period, the mean \n\nattack rate was 3.7 attacks/month with 52% (65/125) of subjects experiencing \u22653 attacks/month.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nAll TAKHZYRO treatment arms produced statistically significant reductions in the mean HAE attack \n\nrate compared to placebo across all primary and secondary endpoints in the Intent-to-Treat population \n\n(ITT) (Table 2).  \n\n \n\nTable 2.

A reduction of 6 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. The \n\npercentage of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in AE-QoL total score was \n\n65% (Odds ratio vs placebo, [95% CI]= 3.2 [1.1, 9.2]), 63% (2.9 [1.1, 8.1]), and 81% (7.2 [2.2, 23.4]), \n\nin TAKHZYRO 150 mg q4 wks, 300 mg q4 wks, and 300 mg q2 wks groups, respectively, compared \n\nto 37% of patients in the placebo group.  \n\n \n\nTable 4 Change in AE-QoL scorea - placebo vs TAKHZYRO at week 26 in HELP study  \n\n \n\nLS mean change (SD) from baseline at week 26 Placebo \nTAKHZYRO \n\ntotal \n\nAE-QoL Total score -4.7 (18.8) -19.5 (18.6) \n\nFunctioning score -5.4 (22.7) -29.3 (22.9) \n\nFatigue/Mood score -1.8 (23.3) -13.0 (23.1) \n\nFear/Shame score -9.0 (24.0) -18.8 (23.7) \n\nNutrition score 0.5 (22.5) -17.0 (22.3) \n\nNote: AE-QoL= Angioedema Quality of Life; LS=least squares; SD=standard deviation.  \na Lower scores indicate lower impairment (or better health-related quality of life).  \n\n \nHELP study extension  \n\n \n\nLong-term safety and efficacy of TAKHZYRO for prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks was evaluated \n\nin an open-label HELP study extension.  \n\nA total of 212 adult and adolescent subjects with symptomatic type I or II HAE received at least one \n\ndose of lanadelumab in this study, including 109 subjects who entered as rollover subjects from the \n\nHELP study and 103 new or non-rollover subjects (including 19 subjects from Phase1b study) who \n\n\n\n9 \n\nhad an historical baseline attack rate of \u22651 attack per 12 weeks Subjects were allowed to initiate \n\nself-administration after receiving the first 2 doses from a health care professional in clinic and \n\ncompleting appropriate training. Interim analysis indicates that the effect was sustained up to one year \n\nof treatment.  \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nTAKHZYRO in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of hereditary \n\nangioedema attacks.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n\n \n\nThe single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lanadelumab have been studied in patients with \n\nHAE. Pharmacokinetics of lanadelumab showed linear dose-exposure response with doses up to \n\n400 mg and reproducible exposure following subcutaneous administration up to 12 months. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of lanadelumab after subcutaneous administration has not been determined. In \n\nthe HELP study, patients treated with 300 mg q2 wks presented mean (SD) area under the curve over \n\nthe dosing interval at steady-state (AUCtau,ss), maximum concentration at steady-state (Cmax,ss) and \n\nminimum concentration at steady-state (Cmin,ss) of 408 \u00b5g*day/ml (138), 34.4 \u00b5g/mL (11.2), and \n\n25.4 \u00b5g/mL (9.18), respectively. The anticipated time to reach steady state concentration was \n\napproximately 70 days.  \n\n \n\nAbsorption  \n\n \n\nFollowing SC administration, the time to maximum concentration is approximately 5 days. The site of \n\nSC injection (thigh, arm, or abdomen) and self-administration did not affect the absorption of \n\nlanadelumab.  \n\n \n\nDistribution  \n\n \n\nThe mean (SD) volume of distribution of lanadelumab in patients with HAE is 14.5 litres (4.53). \n\nLanadelumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody and is not expected to bind to plasma proteins.  \n\n \n\nElimination  \n\n \n\nLanadelumab has a mean (SD) total body clearance of 0.0297 L/h (0.0124) and a terminal elimination \n\nhalf-life of approximately 14 days.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nNo dedicated studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of lanadelumab in special \n\npatient populations including gender, age, pregnant women or the presence of renal or hepatic \n\nimpairment.  \n\n \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, after correcting for body weight, no influence of gender or \n\nage (12 to 75 years) was apparent on the clearance or volume of distribution of lanadelumab.  \n\n \n\nAlthough body weight was identified as an important covariate describing the variability of clearance, \n\na 300 mg q2wks dose regimen provided sufficient exposure for the indication (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment  \n\n \n\nAs IgG monoclonal antibodies are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism, renal impairment or \n\nhepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance of lanadelumab.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nAccordingly, in a population pharmacokinetic analysis, renal impairment (estimated GFR: \n\n60 to 89 ml/min/1.73 m2 [mild, N=98] and 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73m2 [moderate, N=9]) had no effect on \n\nthe clearance or volume of distribution of lanadelumab.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\n \n\nIn repeat-dose studies evaluating once weekly SC injection in both rats (up to 28 days) and \n\ncynomolgus monkeys (up to 6 months) lanadelumab was well-tolerated at doses of up to and including \n\n50 mg/kg (highest dose tested) with no organs of toxicity identified. Exposures in cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys following 6 months of administration were approximately 23-fold greater than that noted at \n\n300 mg q2 wks based on AUC. \n\n \n\nLanadelumab is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material, as it is \n\nmade up entirely of naturally occurring amino acids and contains no inorganic or synthetic linkers or \n\nother nonprotein portions; therefore no genotoxicity evaluation has been conducted. \n\nCarcinogenicity has not been evaluated in animals as based on the weight of evidence approach, \n\nlanadelumab is considered to have a low risk for carcinogenicity.  \n\n \n\nThe effects of lanadelumab on fertility were evaluated in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. In a \n\n13-week study, once weekly SC administration of lanadelumab had no effects on male or female \n\nfertility at doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg (highest dose tested). Exposures in sexually mature cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys in the fertility study were approximately 20-and 22-fold greater than that noted at \n\n300 mg q2 wks based on Cmax and AUC, respectively.  \n\n \n\nIn the ePPND study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys administered once weekly doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg \n\n(highest dose tested), there were no lanadelumab-related effects on pregnancy and parturition, \n\nembryo-foetal development, survival, growth, and/or postnatal development of offspring. Exposures in \n\nthe ePPND study were approximately 32-fold greater than that noted at 300 mg q2 wks based on \n\nAUC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What TAKHZYRO is and what it is used for  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO contains the active substance lanadelumab.  \n\n \n\nWhat TAKHZYRO is used for  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is a medicine used in adults,  and adolescents aged 12 years and older to prevent \n\nangioedema attacks, in patients with HAE.  \n\n \n\nWhat hereditary angioedema (HAE) is  \n\n \n\nHAE is a condition which runs in families. With this condition your blood does not have enough of a \n\nprotein called \u2018C1 inhibitor\u2019, or C1 inhibitor does not work properly. This leads to too much \u2018plasma \n\nkallikrein\u2019, which in turn produces higher levels of \u2018bradykinin\u2019 in your bloodstream. Too much \n\nbradykinin leads to symptoms of HAE like swelling and pain on the, \n\n\u2022 hands and feet  \n\n\u2022 face, eyelids, lips or tongue  \n\n\u2022 voice-box (larynx), which may make breathing difficult  \n\n\u2022 genitals  \n\n \n\nHow TAKHZYRO works  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is a type of protein that blocks the activity of plasma kallikrein. This helps to reduce the \n\namount of bradykinin in your bloodstream and prevents symptoms of HAE.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nDo not use TAKHZYRO:  \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to lanadelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using TAKHZYRO.  \n\n\u2022 If you have a severe allergic reaction to TAKHZYRO with symptoms such as a rash, a tight \n\nchest, wheezing, or a fast heart beat, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately.  \n\n \n\nKeeping a record  \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time you have a dose of TAKHZYRO, you write down the \n\nname and batch number of the medicine. This is so that you keep a record of the batches used.  \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are using TAKHZYRO before you have laboratory tests to measure how well \n\nyour blood is clotting. This is because TAKHZYRO in the blood may interfere with some laboratory \n\ntests, leading to inaccurate results \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age. This is because it has not \n\nbeen studied in this age group.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines.  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is not known to affect other medicines or be affected by other medicines.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting to use TAKHZYRO. There is limited information \n\non the safety of TAKHZYRO use during pregnancy and breast-feeding. As a precautionary measure, it \n\nis preferable to avoid the use of lanadelumab during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Your doctor will \n\ndiscuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines  \n\n \n\nThis medicine has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO contains sodium  \n\n \n\nThe medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml of solution, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is provided in single-use vials as ready-to-use solution.

Gather an alcohol swab, cotton ball/gauze pad, adhesive bandage and a sharps disposal \n\ncontainer (Figure B) and place on a clean, flat, surface in a well-lit area. These supplies are not \n\nincluded in the TAKHZYRO packaging.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure B  \n\nb. Remove TAKHZYRO from refrigerator, open the carton box and remove the TAKHZYRO pre-\n\nfilled syringe from the tray.  \n\n\u2022 Do not use the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe if the tamper evident seal is open or \n\nbroken.  \n\n\u2022 Before you prepare your injection, allow the pre-filled syringe to reach room \n\ntemperature for at least 15 to 30 minutes.  \n\n\u2022 Your medicine is sensitive to warm temperatures. Do not use external heat sources \n\nsuch as hot water to warm your TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe.  \n\n\u2022 Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to inject.  \n\nc. Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry your hands completely (Figure C).  \n\n \n\nFigure C  \n\nd. Check the expiration date on the label (Figure D).  \n\n\n\n53 \n\n\u2022 Do not use TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe if the expiration date has passed.  \n\n \n\nFigure D  \n\ne. Visually inspect the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe for any damage and make sure the \n\nmedicine is colourless to slightly yellow.  \n\n\u2022 Do not use product if syringe is damaged \u2013 e.g., cracked syringe.  \n\n\u2022 Do not administer if the medicine is discoloured, cloudy or has flakes or particles in it \n\nand call your Healthcare Provider.  \n\n\u2022 You might see air bubbles in the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe. This is normal and \n\nwill not affect your dose.  \n\nSTEP 2: Select and prepare your injection site  \n\na. The TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe should be injected into your stomach (abdomen), thigh, or \n\nthe back of the upper arm (the outer area of the upper arm is not recommended if you are \n\ninjecting yourself) (Figure E).  \n\n\u2022 It is important to rotate injection sites to keep skin healthy. Each new injection should \n\nbe given at least 3 cm from the last site you used.  \n\n\u2022 Do not inject into an area of your body where the skin is irritated, reddened, bruised, \n\nor infected.  \n\n\u2022 The area you choose for injection should be at least 5 cm away from any scars or your \n\nbelly button (navel).  \n\n \n\nFigure E  \n\nb. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry.  \n\n\u2022 Do not fan or blow on the clean site.  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n\u2022 Do not touch this area again before giving your injection.  \n\nc. Remove needle cap from the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe. Gently pull the needle cap straight \n\noff with one hand and firmly hold the middle of the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe with the \n\nother hand. Throw away the needle cap (Figure F).  \n\n\u2022 Do not recap your TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe.  \n\n\u2022 Do not use the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe if it has been dropped without the \n\nneedle cap on or if the needle looks damaged or bent.  \n\n\u2022 Do not touch the needle or allow the needle to touch anything.  \n\n \n\nFigure F  \n\nSTEP 3: Inject TAKHZYRO  \n\na. Grip the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe in one hand like a pencil. Avoid touching the needle or \n\npushing on the plunger (Figure G).  \n\n \n\nFigure G  \n\nb. With your other hand, gently pinch about 3 cm fold of skin at the cleaned injection site.  \n\nc. With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin.  Make sure to keep the needle \n\nin place (Figure H).  \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nFigure H \n\nd. Slowly push the plunger until all of the liquid is injected and the syringe is empty, then gently \n\nlet go of your skin.  \n\ne. Slowly withdraw needle while maintaining the syringe at the same angle (Figure I).  \n\n \n\nFigure I  \n\nf. Press cotton ball or gauze pad over injection site if needed and hold for 10 seconds.  \n\n\u2022 Do not rub the injection site. You may have a minor bleeding. This is normal.  \n\n\u2022 Cover injection site with an adhesive bandage if needed.  \n\ng. Throw away your used TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe.  \n\n\u2022 Do not touch the needle.  \n\n\u2022 To avoid a needle-stick injury, do not recap the needle.  \n\n\u2022 Put your used TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringes in a sharps disposal container right away \n\nafter use.  \n\n\u2022 Do not reuse the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe and any of your injection supplies.  \n\nImportant: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
