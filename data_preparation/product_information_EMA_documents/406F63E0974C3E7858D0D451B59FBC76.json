PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nHEXAVAC is a slightly opaque white suspension \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis combined vaccine is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of children against diphtheria, \ntetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B caused by all known subtypes of viruses, poliomyelitis and invasive \ninfections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPrimary vaccination : \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses of 0.5 ml administered within the first \nyear of life according to official recommendations. There should be an interval of at least 1 month \nbetween doses : such as 2 , 3, 4 months; 2, 4, 6 months; 3, 5 months. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 3 \n\nBooster : \nAfter a primary vaccination with 2 doses of HEXAVAC (i.e. 3, 5 months), a booster dose must be \ngiven between 11 and 13 months of age; after a  primary vaccination with 3 doses of Hexavac (e.g. 2, \n3, 4 months; 2, 4, 6 months), a booster dose must be given between 12 and 18 months of age, \naccording to official recommendations.  \n HEXAVAC can be used for the booster dose provided the toddler has received a full primary \nvaccination course of each of the antigens contained in HEXAVAC regardless of whether they were \nadministered as monovalent or combination vaccines produced by Sanofi Pasteur MSD. \n \nMethod of administration \nHEXAVAC should be administered intramuscularly into the quadriceps or deltoid preferably at \nalternating sites for subsequent injections. \n \nThis vaccine should not be used in newborns, adolescents or adults. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nKnown hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or severe reaction after previous \nadministration of the vaccine. \n \nEncephalopathy within 7 days of administration of a previous dose of any vaccine containing pertussis \nantigens (whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines). \n \nIn these circumstances the vaccination course should be continued with vaccine not containing a \npertussis component. \nVaccination should be postponed in the case of fever or acute disease. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nThis vaccine should not be used in newborns, adolescents or adults. \n \nInfants born of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers should receive Hepatitis B \nImmune Globulin (HBIG) and Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) at birth and should complete the \nhepatitis B vaccination series. The subsequent administration of HEXAVAC for completion of the \nhepatitis B vaccination series in infants who were born of HBsAg-positive mothers and received \nHBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has not been studied. HEXAVAC should not be \nused as the birth dose or subsequent doses during the first year of life for children born to HbsAg-\npositive mothers. \n \nHEXAVAC should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nHEXAVAC should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. The intradermal or \nsubcutaneous routes must not be used either. \n \nIf any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of the \nvaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines should be carefully \nconsidered: \n\nTemperature of â¥ 40.0 Â°C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \nCollapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episode) within 48 hours of \nvaccination. \nPersistent, inconsolable crying lasting â¥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination. \nConvulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. \n \n\nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local guidelines. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 4 \n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be readily \navailable for immediate use in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of \nvaccine. \n \nIn subjects who have a history of a severe reaction within 48 hours of a previous injection with a \nvaccine containing similar components, the course of vaccination should be carefully considered. \n \nBecause of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B \ninfection to be present at the time of immunisation. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection \nin such cases. \n \nHEXAVAC will not prevent hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C \nand hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens. \n \nHEXAVAC does not protect against invasive diseases due to serotypes other than Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b or against meningitis of other origins. \n \nAs each dose may contain undetectable traces of neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B, caution \nshould be exercised when the vaccine is administered to subjects with hypersensitivity to these \nantibiotics. \n \nThe immunogenicity of HEXAVAC could be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or \nimmunodeficiency. In such cases it is recommended to postpone the vaccination until the end of the \ndisease or treatment. Nevertheless, vaccination of subjects with chronic immunodeficiency such as \nHIV infection is recommended even if the antibody response might be limited. \n \nThere are currently no sufficient data available regarding immunogenicity of the concomitant \nadministration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine, \nadsorbed). However when HEXAVAC was co-administered with PREVENAR (pneumococcal \npolysaccharide conjugated vaccine, adsorbed) in clinical studies, the rate of febrile reactions was \nhigher compared to that occurring following the administration of hexavalent vaccines alone. These \nreactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39Â° C) and transient. \n \nHEXAVAC must not be mixed in the same syringe with other vaccines or other parenterally \nadministered drugs. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nExcept in the case of immunosuppressive therapy (see 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions \nfor use), no significant clinical interaction with other treatments or biological products has been  \ndocumented. \n \nThere are no data in regards to the efficacy and safety of concomitant administration of HEXAVAC \nwith Measles, Mumps and Rubella Virus Vaccine, live. \n \nThere are currently no sufficient data available regarding immunogenicity of the concomitant \nadministration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine, \nadsorbed). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nNot applicable \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot applicable \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nâ¢ Clinical trials experience \n \nIn clinical trials, more than 3,900 infants and 4,400 toddlers (from 12 to 20 months of age) have \nreceived HEXAVAC. \n \nCommonly reported reactions included redness and/or induration/swelling/pain at the injection site, \nfever equal to or greater than 38 Â°C, irritability, drowsiness, loss of appetite, insomnia, diarrhoea and \nvomiting. Less commonly, fever equal to or greater than 40 Â°C, tenderness at the injection site, \nprolonged inconsolable crying and redness and/or induration > 7 cm at the injection site or swelling of \nthe entire limb have been reported. Febrile convulsion and high-pitched crying have been reported \nrarely. A single bilateral oedematous reaction of the lower limbs and a single, hypotonic hypo-\nresponsive episode have been reported. \n \nThese signs and symptoms usually occurred within 48 hours following the vaccination. They were \nmostly mild, generally lasting for up to 72 hours and resolved spontaneously. \n \nNo increase in the number of undesirable reactions was noted between first, second and third doses of \nthe primary series except for an increase in the rate of fever equal to or greater than 38 Â°C after the \nsecond dose in the primary series. \n \nThe rate of fever equal to or greater than 40 Â°C increased after booster immunisation but remained \n< 1 %. Redness and/or induration > 7 cm at the injection site increased after booster immunisation but \nremained < 1 %. In rare instances, these cases were associated with swelling of the entire limb.  \n \nâ¢ Post marketing experience \nThe following additional undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of \nHEXAVAC.  \n \nCommon (>1/100 and <1/10) \nApplication site disorders (reactions at the injection site): Oedema /  Pruritus / Urticaria. \n \nRare (>1/10,000 and <1/1,000) \nBody as a whole - General disorders: Prolonged or abnormal crying. \n \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nBody as a whole - General disorders: Allergic reaction / Chills / Fatigue / Hypotonic-hyporesponsive \nepisode / Malaise / Oedema / Pallor / Swelling or oedema of the entire limb(s) / Transient local lymph \nnode swelling. \n\n \nCentral and peripheral nervous system disorders:  Convulsions (febrile and non febrile) /  \nEncephalitis / Encephalopathy with acute brain oedema / Eyes rolling  /  Guillain BarrÃ© Syndrome / \nHypotonia / Neuritis. \n \nGastro-intestinal system disorders: Abdominal pain / Meteorism / Nausea. \n \nPlatelets, bleeding & clotting disorders: Petechiae / Purpura / Purpura thrombocytopenic / \nThrombocytopenia. \n \nPsychiatric disorders: Agitation / Sleep disorder. \n \nRespiratory system disorders: Dyspnoea or Stridor inspiratory. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 6 \n\nSkin and appendages disorders:  Angioedema / Erythema / Pruritus / Rash / Urticaria . \n \nVascular (extracardiac) disorders: Flushing.  \n \nâ¢ Potential undesirable effects \nIn addition, other undesirable effects have been reported with the marketed use of vaccines closely \nrelated to HEXAVAC. \nUndesirable effects reported in clinical trials and the marketed use to date of Sanofi Pasteur MSD \ndiphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b and inactivated poliomyelitis \nadsorbed vaccine are included in the list of undesirable effects for HEXAVAC. \nVery rare reactions following the use of Sanofi Pasteur MSD hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine \ninclude alopecia, hypotension, optic neuritis, facial paralysis, erythema multiforme, and anaphylaxis. \nAs with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship to the vaccine has not \nbeen established. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNot applicable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines, combined, ATC code : J07CA \n\n \nThe diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are prepared from the toxins of cultures of Corynebacterium \ndiphtheriae and Clostridium tetani by formaldehyde detoxification followed by purification. The \nsurface antigen of hepatitis B virus is produced by culture of a recombinant strain of yeast cells \n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \nThe poliomyelitis vaccine is obtained from the propagation of poliomyelitis viruses types 1, 2 and 3 on \nVero cells, purified, then inactivated by formaldehyde. \n \nThe acellular pertussis components (pertussis toxin: PT and filamentous haemagglutinin: FHA) are \nextracted from Bordetella pertussis cultures then separately purified. The pertussis toxin (PT) is \ndetoxified separately with glutaraldehyde to create the toxoid (PTxd). The FHA is not detoxified. It \nhas been shown that PTxd and FHA play a major role in protection against pertussis. \nThis vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide (polyribosyl ribitol phosphate: PRP) of \nHaemophilus influenzae type b conjugated to tetanus toxoid. When administered alone PRP induces a \nserological response, but it is weakly immunogenic in infants. The covalent binding of PRP to tetanus \ntoxoid makes it a T-cell dependent antigen which induces a specific IgG anti-PRP response in infants \nand which elicits immune memory. \n \nThis vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) and against diphtheria \nand tetanus toxoids (anti-D and anti-T). Development of anti-HBs titre equal to or greater than 10 \nmIU/ml and of anti-D and anti-T equal to or greater than 0.01 IU/ml measured 1-2 months after the \nthird injection correlates with protection against hepatitis B infection and against diphtheria and \ntetanus respectively. \n \nImmune response after primary vaccination \nIn the pivotal clinical study, all infants (100 %) developed a seroprotective antibody level (equal to or \ngreater than 0.01 IU/ml) to both diphtheria and tetanus antigens one month after completion of the \nprimary series. For pertussis, 91.8 % and 90.5 % of infants achieved a four-fold rise in PT and FHA \nantibody titres respectively. The 4-fold increase in post immunisation titres is considered a sign of \nseroconversion of which the clinical significance is unknown in the absence of a serological correlate \nof protection. Protective levels of anti-HBs (equal to or greater than 10 mIU/ml) were achieved in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 7 \n\n96.6 % of infants ; the geometric mean titres (GMTs) were diminished compared to the control group. \nAnti-poliovirus titres above the threshold of 5 (reciprocal of dilution in seroneutralisation) against \npoliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were developed in 100 % of infants and these were considered protected \nagainst poliomyelitis. After primary vaccination, 93.7 % of infants had an anti-PRP titre equal to or \ngreater than 0.15 Âµg/ml; the GMTs were diminished compared to the control group (2.06 Âµg/ml versus \n3.69 Âµg/ml). \n \nImmune response after booster injection \nIn the pivotal clinical study where toddlers received HEXAVAC as a booster dose after having been \nprimed with HEXAVAC, antibody titres equal to or greater than 0.1 IU/ml were achieved by all \ntoddlers to tetanus and by 98.8 % to diphtheria. A mean 7.4 and 4.3-fold rise in antibody titres to PT \nand FHA respectively was achieved and all toddlers developed protective antibody titres against \npoliovirus types 1, 2 and 3. Just before the booster injection anti-PRP GMTs were 0.40 Âµg/ml and \n0.64 Âµg/ml for HEXAVAC and for the control group respectively. After booster, GMTs increased to \n16.7 Âµg/ml and 23.0 Âµg/ml in each group respectively, indicating a strong anamnestic response. Anti-\nPRP titres equal to or greater than 0.15 Âµg/ml and equal to or greater than 1 Âµg/ml were achieved in \n100 % and 96.6 % of toddlers respectively. Following the booster dose, 96.6 % of toddlers developed \nanti-HBs titres equal to or greater than 10 mIU/ml. A mean 20.5-fold rise in antibody titres to HBs was \nobserved after the booster dose. Other trials gave similar or higher results. Surveillance and antibody \nlong term persistence studies are ongoing and will provide additional information in regards to the \nduration of protection. \nAfter a 3, 5, 12 months schedule, immune responses were compatible with the sought clinical \nprotection and of the same magnitude as those reported previously for HEXAVAC or other licensed \ncombination vaccines during the second year of life \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEvaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data including single-dose, repeated dose and local tolerance studies revealed no \nunexpected findings and no target organ toxicity. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \n\nFormulation contains aluminium hydroxide and a buffer solution of disodium phosphate, \nmonopotassium phosphate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, trometamol, sucrose, medium 199 \n(complex blend of amino acids, mineral salts, vitamins and other ingredients) and water for injections. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThe vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with other vaccines or parenterally administered \nsubstances. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n 36 months \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore at 2 Â°C â 8 Â°C (in a refrigerator). \nDo not freeze. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 8 \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n0.5 ml of suspension in pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with a plunger stopper (chlorobromobutyl) \nwith attached needle - pack of 1, 10, 25 and 50. \n0.5 ml of suspension in pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with a plunger stopper (chlorobromobutyl) \nwithout needle - pack of 1, 10, 25 and 50. \n0.5 ml of suspension in pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with a plunger stopper (chlorobromobutyl), \nwith 1 or 2 separate needles - pack of 1 and 10. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Instructions for use and handling \n \nBefore use, the vaccine should be well shaken in order to obtain a homogeneous slightly opaque white \nsuspension. \n \nFor needle free syringes, the needle should be pushed firmly on to the end of the prefilled syringe and \nrotated through 90 degrees. \n \n \n7.

WHAT IS HEXAVAC AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nHEXAVAC is an injectable vaccine in a 0.5 ml single dose syringe. \n \nHEXAVAC is indicated to help protect your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, \ninfection of the liver caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus and invasive disease (infection \nof brain and spinal cord tissues, infection of the blood, etc.) caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b \n(Hib) bacterium in children 8 weeks to 18 months of age. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nHEXAVAC is available in packs of 1, 10, 25 and 50 with or without neddles. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE HEXAVAC \n \nDo not use HEXAVAC: \n \n- if your child is allergic to any component of the vaccine. \n- in case of newborns, adolescents or adults.  \n- if your child has  fever or other illness, particularly a cough, cold or flu (vaccination should be \n\ndelayed). \n- if your infant has suffered brain damage (encephalopathy) following a previous dose of a whole \n\ncell or acellular pertussis vaccine. \n \nTake special care with HEXAVAC: \n \n- if your child has an hypersensitivity to neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B, due to the use \n\nof these substances during production. \n- if your child has a thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following \n\nan intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n- if any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of the \n\nvaccine (The decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines to your child  \nshould be carefully considered if any of the following events are known to have occurred \nfollowing the administration of the vaccine) : \n\nTemperature of â¥ 40.0 Â°C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \nCollapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episode) within 48 hours of \nvaccination. \nPersistent, inconsolable crying lasting â¥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination. \nConvulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. \n\n- if your child has any present or past medical problems or allergies, including allergic reactions \nafter any dose of HEXAVAC.  \n\n- if you are a hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mother, your infant should \nreceive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine (Recombinant) at birth \nand should complete the hepatitis B vaccination series. The subsequent administration of \nHEXAVAC for completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series in infants who were born of \nHBsAg-positive mothers and received HBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has \nnot been studied. HEXAVAC should not be used as the birth dose or subsequent doses during \nthe first year of life for children born to HbsAg-positive mothers . \n\n- because as with other similar vaccines, cases of Haemophilus b disease may occur in the week \nafter vaccination prior to the onset of the protective effects of the vaccine.  \n\n- because hepatitis B infection can go undetected for a long period of time, it is possible that an \nindividual may already be infected at the time the vaccine is given. The vaccine may not prevent \nhepatitis B in these individuals. \n\n \nUsing other vaccines  \nThere are currently not sufficient data available regarding immune response of the concomitant \nadministration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine, \nadsorbed). However, when HEXAVAC was co-administered in clinical studies the rate of febrile \nreactions was higher compared to that occurring following administration of hexavalent vaccines \nalone. These reactions were mostly moderate and transient. If your child is due to be vaccinated with \nHEXAVAC and other vaccines simultaneously, please ask your doctor for further information. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\n3.  HOW TO USE HEXAVAC \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses of 0.5 ml administered within the first \nyear of life according to the official recommendations. There should be an interval of at least 1 month \nbetween doses : such as 2 , 3, 4 months; 2, 4, 6 months; 3, 5 months. \n \nAfter a primary vaccination with 2 doses of HEXAVAC (e.g 3, 5 months), a booster dose must  be \ngiven between 11 and 13 months of age; after a  primary vaccination with 3 doses of Hexavac (e.g. 2, \n3, 4 months; 2, 4, 6 months), a booster dose must be given between 12 and 18 months of age, \naccording to official recommendations.  \nHEXAVAC can be used for the booster dose provided the toddler has received a full primary \nvaccination course of each of the antigens contained in Hexavac regardless of whether they were \nadministered as monovalent or combination vaccines produced by Sanofi Pasteur MSD. \n \nHEXAVAC should be injected into the quadriceps or deltoid muscle preferably at alternating sites for \nsubsequent injections. \nHEXAVAC should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. The intradermal or \nsubcutaneous routes must not be used either.  \n \nHEXAVAC must not be mixed in the same syringe with other vaccines or other parenterally \nadministered drugs. \n \nFor needle free syringes, the needle should be pushed firmly on to the end of the prefilled syringe and \nrotated through 90 degrees. \n \nIf you forget to take HEXAVAC: \nYour doctor will decide when to give the missed dose. \n \n \n4.  POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nAs with other vaccines your child may have some side effects. HEXAVAC has been generally well \ntolerated in clinical trials. Side effects included injection-site reactions such as tenderness, redness, \nswelling and pain. Other side effects included irritability, sleepiness, fever, sleeplessness, diarrhoea, \nvomiting, loss of appetite and prolonged crying where the child cannot be consoled.  \n \nFollowing the widespread use of HEXAVAC, additional undesirable effects have been reported: \nAmong reactions found at the injection site, itching and hives have been also reported.   \nRarely, the patient may have prolonged or abnormal crying.   \nVery rarely there may be allergic reaction; chills; fatigue; malaise; oedema; swelling of the entire \nlimb(s); Guillain BarrÃ© Syndrome; hypotonic hyporesponsive episode; pallor; convulsions (with or \nwithout fever); brain inflammation, acute brain swelling; eyes rolling; decrease in muscle tone; \nneuritis; nausea; abdominal gas and/or pain; low platelet count; purple or red brown spots visible \nthrough the skin; agitation; difficulty sleeping; breathing difficulty ; wheezing ; swelling of the face, \nlips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing; rash; skin \nredness; generalized hives; generalized itching; flushing; temporary swelling of local lymph nodes. \n \nTell your doctor promptly about these symptoms. If the condition persists or worsens, you may have to \nbring your child to the doctor. \n \nIn addition, tell your doctor if your child experiences any symptoms that suggest an allergic reaction \nsuch as rash, redness, itching, pallor or oedema after any dose in the vaccination series. \n \nIf you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42 \n\n5.
