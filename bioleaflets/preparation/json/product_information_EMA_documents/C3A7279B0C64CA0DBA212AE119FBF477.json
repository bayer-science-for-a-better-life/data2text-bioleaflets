CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nMultiple myeloma \n\nLenalidomide Accord as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with \n\nnewly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide Accord as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and \n\ndexamethasone, or melphalan and prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult \n\npatients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. \n\n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nLenalidomide Accord in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple \n\nmyeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma \n\nLenalidomide Accord in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the \n\ntreatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nLenalidomide treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer \n\ntherapies. \n\n \n\nFor all indications described below: \n\n Dose is modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings (see section 4.4). \n\n Dose adjustments, during treatment and restart of treatment, are recommended to manage \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or other Grade 3 or 4 toxicity judged to be \n\nrelated to lenalidomide. \n\n In case of neutropenia, the use of growth factors in patient management should be considered. \n\n If less than 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose, the patient can take the dose. If more \nthan 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose at the normal time, the patient should not take \n\nthe dose, but take the next dose at the normal time on the following day.  \n \n\nPosology \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) \n\n \n\nLenalidomide maintenance in patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation \n\n(ASCT) \n\nLenalidomide maintenance should be initiated after adequate haematologic recovery following ASCT \n\nin patients without evidence of progression. Lenalidomide must not be started if the Absolute \n\nNeutrophil Count (ANC) is < 1.0 x 109/L, and/or platelet counts are < 75 x 109/L. \n\n \n\nRecommended dose \n\nThe recommended starting dose is lenalidomide 10 mg orally once daily continuously (on days 1 to 28 \n\nof repeated 28-day cycles) given until disease progression or intolerance. After 3 cycles of \n\nlenalidomide maintenance, the dose can be increased to 15 mg orally once daily if tolerated.  \n\n \n\nDose reduction steps \n\n Starting dose (10 mg) If dose increased (15 mg) a \n\nDose level -1 5 mg 10 mg \n\nDose level -2 5 mg (days 1-21 every 28 days) 5 mg \n\nDose level -3 Not applicable 5 mg (days 1-21 every 28 days) \n\n Do not dose below 5 mg (days 1-21 every 28 days) \na After 3 cycles of lenalidomide maintenance, the dose can be increased to 15 mg orally once daily if tolerated. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nWhen platelets Recommended course \n\nFalls to < 30 x 109/L Interrupt lenalidomide treatment \n\nReturns to ≥ 30 x 109/L Resume lenalidomide at dose level -1 once \n\ndaily \n\nFor each subsequent drop below 30 x 109/L Interrupt lenalidomide treatment \n\nReturns to ≥ 30 x 109/L Resume lenalidomide at next lower dose level \n\nonce daily \n\n \n\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC)-neutropenia \n\nWhen ANC Recommended coursea \n\nFalls to < 0.5 x 109/L Interrupt lenalidomide treatment  \n\nReturns to ≥ 0.5 x 109/L Resume lenalidomide at dose level -1 once \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nWhen ANC Recommended coursea \n\ndaily \n\nFor each subsequent drop below < 0.5 x 109/L Interrupt lenalidomide treatment \n\nReturns to ≥ 0.5 x 109/L Resume lenalidomide at next lower dose level \n\nonce daily \na At the physician’s discretion, if neutropenia is the only toxicity at any dose level, add granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and \n\nmaintain the dose level of lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until disease progression in patients who are not \n\neligible for transplant \n\nLenalidomide treatment must not be started if the ANC is < 1.0 x 109/L, and/or platelet counts are \n\n< 50 x 109/L. \n\n \n\nRecommended dose \n\nThe recommended starting dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 21 of repeated \n\n28-day cycles.  \n\nThe recommended dose of dexamethasone is 40 mg orally once daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of \n\nrepeated 28-day cycles. Patients may continue lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy until disease \n\nprogression or intolerance.  \n\n \n\nDose reduction steps \n\n Lenalidomidea Dexamethasonea \n\nStarting dose 25 mg 40 mg \n\nDose level -1 20 mg 20 mg \n\nDose level -2 15 mg 12 mg \n\nDose level -3 10 mg 8 mg \n\nDose level- 4 5 mg 4 mg \n\nDose level -5 2.5 mg Not applicable \nª Dose reduction for both medicinal  products can be managed independently \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nWhen platelets Recommended course \n\nFalls to < 25 x 109/L Stop lenalidomide dosing for remainder of \n\ncycleª \n\nReturns to ≥ 50 x 109/L Decrease by one dose level when dosing \n\nresumed at next cycle \n\nª If Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs on > day15 of a cycle, lenalidomide dosing will be interrupted for at least the remainder of the \ncurrent 28-day cycle. \n \n\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) - neutropenia \n\nWhen ANC Recommended course \n\nFirst falls to < 0.5 x 109/L Interrupt lenalidomide treatment \n\nReturns to ≥ 1 x 109/L when neutropenia is the only \n\nobserved toxicity \n\nResume lenalidomide at starting dose once \n\ndaily \n\nReturns to ≥ 0.5 x 109/L when dose-dependent \n\nhaematological toxicities other than neutropenia are \n\nobserved \n\nResume lenalidomide at dose level -1 once \n\ndaily \n\nFor each subsequent drop below < 0.5 x 109/L Interrupt lenalidomide treatment \n\nReturns to ≥ 0.5 x 109/L Resume lenalidomide at next lower dose level \n\nonce daily.  \na At the physician’s discretion, if neutropenia is the only toxicity at any dose level, add granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and \n\nmaintain the dose level of lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFor hematologic toxicity the dose of lenalidomide may be re-introduced to the next higher dose level \n\n(up to the starting dose) upon improvement in bone marrow function (no hematologic toxicity for at \n\nleast 2 consecutive cycles: ANC ≥1,5 x 109/L with a platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L at the beginning of a \n\nnew cycle). \n\n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n \n\n Lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by lenalidomide \nand dexamethasone until disease progression in patients who are not eligible for transplant \n\nInitial treatment: Lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nLenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone must not be started if the ANC is \n\n< 1.0 x 109/L, and/or platelet counts are < 50 x 109/L.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is lenalidomide 25 mg orally once daily days 1-14 of each 21-day \n\ncycle in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone.

To monitor for TLS, patients should have a chemistry panel drawn weekly \n\nduring the first cycle and as clinically indicated. \n\nLenalidomide may be continued (maintain dose) in patients with laboratory TLS or Grade 1 clinical \n\nTLS, or at the physician’s discretion, reduce dose by one level and continue lenalidomide. Vigorous \n\nintravenous hydration should be provided and appropriate medical management according to the local \n\nstandard of care, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Rasburicase therapy may be needed to \n\nreduce hyperuricaemia. Hospitalisation of the patient will be at physician’s discretion. \n\nIn patients with Grade 2 to 4 clinical TLS, interrupt lenalidomide and obtain a chemistry panel weekly \n\nor as clinically indicated. Vigorous intravenous hydration should be provided and appropriate medical \n\nmanagement according to the local standard of care, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities. \n\nRasburicase therapy and hospitalisation will be at physician’s discretion. When the TLS resolves to \n\nGrade 0, restart lenalidomide at next lower dose per physician’s discretion (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTumour flare reaction \n\nAt the physician’s discretion, lenalidomide may be continued in patients with Grade 1 or 2 tumour \n\nflare reaction (TFR) without interruption or modification. At the physician’s discretion, , therapy with \n\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), limited duration corticosteroids, and/or narcotic \n\nanalgesics may be administered. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, withhold treatment with \n\nlenalidomide and initiate therapy with NSAIDs, corticosteroids and/or narcotic analgesics. WhenTFR \n\nresolves to ≤ Grade 1 , restart lenalidomide treatment at the same dose level for the rest of the cycle. \n\nPatients may be treated for management of symptoms per the guidance for treatment of Grade 1 and 2 \n\nTFR (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nAll indications \n\nFor other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities judged to be related to lenalidomide, treatment should be stopped and \n\nonly restarted at next lower dose level when toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 2 depending on the \n\nphysician’s discretion. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2 or 3 skin rash. \n\nLenalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Drug Reaction with \n\nEosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is suspectedand should not be resumed following \n\ndiscontinuation from these reactions. \n\n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nCurrently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2. Lenalidomide has been used in \n\nclinical trials in multiple myeloma patients up to 91 years of age (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nBecause elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose \n\nselection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant \n\nPatients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed \n\nbefore treatment is considered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor patients older than 75 years of age treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone, \n\nthe starting dose of dexamethasone is 20 mg once daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day \n\ntreatment cycle. \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is proposed for patients older than 75 years who are treated with lenalidomide in \n\ncombination with melphalan and prednisone. \n\n \n\nIn patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older who received \n\nlenalidomide, there was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions that led \n\nto treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide combined therapy was less tolerated in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients \n\nolder than 75 years of age compared to the younger population. These patients discontinued at a higher \n\nrate due to intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events), when compared to \n\npatients < 75 years. \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy  \n\nThe percentage of multiple myeloma patients aged 65 or over was not significantly different between \n\nthe lenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups. No overall difference in safety \n\nor efficacy was observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater pre-disposition of \n\nolder individuals cannot be ruled out.  \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma \n\nFor follicular lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with rituximab, the overall \n\nrate of adverse events is similar for patients aged 65 years or over compared with patients under 65 \n\nyears of age. No overall difference in efficacy was observed between the two age groups. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nLenalidomide is primarily excreted by the kidney; patients with greater degrees of renal impairment \n\ncan have impaired treatment tolerance (see section 4.4). Care should be taken in dose selection and \n\nmonitoring of renal function is advised. \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustments are required for patients with mild renal impairment and multiple myeloma or \n\nfollicular lymphoma. The following dose adjustments are recommended at the start of therapy and \n\nthroughout treatment for patients with moderate or severe impaired renal function or end stage renal \n\ndisease. \n\nThere are no phase III trial experiences with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (CLcr < 30 mL/min, \n\nrequiring dialysis). \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma \n\nRenal function (CLcr) Dose adjustment \n\n \n\nModerate renal impairment \n\n(30  CLcr < 50 mL/min) \n\n10 mg once daily1 \n\nSevere renal impairment 7.5 mg once daily2 \n\n\n\n 11 \n\n(CLcr < 30 mL/min, not requiring dialysis) 15 mg every other day \n\nEnd Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) \n\n(CLcr < 30 mL/min, requiring dialysis) \n\n5 mg once daily.

Toxicity judged to be related to lenalidomide do not dose below 5 mg every other day or 2.5 mg once daily. \n 3 Patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD were excluded from study. \n\n \n\nAfter initiation of lenalidomide therapy, subsequent lenalidomide dose modification in renally \n\nimpaired patients should be based on individual patient treatment tolerance, as described above. \n\n \n\n Patients with hepatic impairment \nLenalidomide has not formally been studied in patients with impaired hepatic function and there are \n\nno specific dose recommendations. \n\n \n\n•       Paediatric population \n\nLenalidomide should not be used in children and adolescents from birth to less than 18 years because \n\nof safety concerns (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nOral use.  \n\nLenalidomide Accord hard  capsules should be taken orally at about the same time on the scheduled \n\ndays. The capsules should not be opened, broken or chewed. The capsules should be swallowed \n\nwhole, preferably with water, either with or without food. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended to press only on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister thereby \n\nreducing the risk of capsule deformation or breakage. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n Women who are pregnant.  \n\n Women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention \nProgramme are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nWhen lenalidomide is given in combination with other medicinal products, the corresponding \n\nSummary of Product Characteristics must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy warning \n\nLenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active \n\nsubstance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Lenalidomide induced in monkeys’  \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nmalformations similar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide \n\nis taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected. \n\n \n\nThe conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there \n\nis reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. \n\n \n\nCriteria for women of non-childbearing potential \n\nA female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential \n\nunless she meets at least one of the following criteria: \n\n Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (amenorrhoea following cancer therapy \nor during breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential). \n\n Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist \n\n Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy \n\n XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis. \n \n\nCounselling \n\nFor women of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are \n\nmet: \n\n She understands the expected teratogenic risk to the unborn child \n\n She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks \nbefore starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after \n\nthe end of treatment \n\n Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on \neffective contraception \n\n She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures \n\n She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to \nrapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy \n\n She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as lenalidomide is dispensed \nfollowing a negative pregnancy test \n\n She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing at least every 4 weeks \nexcept in case of confirmed tubal sterilisation \n\n She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with \nthe use of lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFor male patients taking lenalidomide, pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that lenalidomide is \n\npresent in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable in human semen \n\n3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a precaution and taking \n\ninto account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal impairment, all male \n\npatients taking lenalidomide must meet the following conditions: \n\n Understand the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or \na woman of childbearing potential \n\n Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant \nwoman or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (even if the man \n\nhas had a vasectomy), during treatment and for at least 7 days after dose interruptions and/or \n\ncessation of treatment. \n\n Understand that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking lenalidomide  or \nshortly after he has stopped taking lenalidomide , he should inform his treating physician \n\nimmediately and that it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or \n\nexperienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. \n\n \n\nThe prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing potential: \n\n The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, including \nconfirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding \n\n The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. \n \n\nContraception \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use at least one effective method of contraception for at least \n\n4 weeks before therapy, during therapy, and until at least 4 weeks after lenalidomide therapy and even \n\nin case of dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence \n\nconfirmed on a monthly basis. If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be \n\nreferred to an appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that \n\ncontraception can be initiated.  \n\n \n\nThe following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception: \n\n Implant \n\n Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) \n\n Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot \n\n Tubal sterilisation \n\n Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two \nnegative semen analyses \n\n Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel) \n \n\nBecause of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking \n\nlenalidomide in combination therapy, and to a lesser extent in patients with multiple myeloma, taking \n\nlenalidomide monotherapy, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see also \n\nsection 4.5).  \n\nIf a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the \n\neffective methods listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after \n\ndiscontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced \n\nduring co-treatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nImplants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of \n\ninfection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be \n\nconsidered particularly in patients with neutropenia. \n\n \n\nCopper-releasing intrauterine devices are generally not recommended due to the potential risks of \n\ninfection at the time of insertion and menstrual blood loss which may compromise patients with \n\nneutropenia or thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nPregnancy testing \n\nAccording to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of \n\n25 mIU/mL must be performed for women of childbearing potential as outlined below. This \n\nrequirement includes women of childbearing potential who practice absolute and continuous \n\nabstinence. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same \n\nday. Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the \n\nprescription. \n\n \n\nPrior to starting treatment \n\nA medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when \n\nlenalidomide is prescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been \n\nusing effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant \n\nwhen she starts treatment with lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFollow-up and end of treatment \n\nA medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated at least every 4 weeks, including at least \n\n4 weeks after the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy \n\ntests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the \n\nprescriber. \n\n \n\nAdditional precautions \n\nPatients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any \n\nunused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment for safe disposal. \n\n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nPatients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 7 daysfollowing discontinuation of \n\nlenalidomide. \n\n \n\nEducational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions \n\nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to lenalidomide, the marketing authorisation \n\nholder will provide educational material to health care professionals to reinforce the warnings about \n\nthe expected teratogenicity of lenalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before therapy is \n\nstarted, and to provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform male \n\nand female patients about the expected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures \n\nas specified in the Pregnancy Prevention Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient \n\neducational brochure, patient card and/or equivalent tool in accordance to the national implemented \n\npatient card system. A national controlled distribution system has been implemented in collaboration \n\nwith each National Competent Authority. The controlled distribution system includes the use of a \n\npatient card and/or equivalent tool for prescribing and/or dispensing controls, and the collecting of \n\ndetailed data relating to the indication in order to monitor closely the off-label use within the national \n\nterritory. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same \n\nday. Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the \n\nprescription and following a medically supervised negative pregnancy test result.  Prescriptions for \n\nwomen of childbearing potential can be for a maximum duration of treatment of 4 weeks, and \n\nprescriptions for all other patients can be for a maximum duration of treatment of 12 weeks. \n\n \n\nOther special warnings and precautions for use \n\nMyocardial infarction \n\nMyocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with \n\nknown risk factors and within the first 12 months when used in combination with dexamethasone. \n\nPatients with known risk factors – including prior thrombosis – should be closely monitored, and \n\naction should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (eg. smoking, hypertension, and \n\nhyperlipidaemia). \n\n \n\nVenous and arterial thromboembolic events \n\nIn patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated \n\nwith an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and \n\npulmonary embolism). The risk of venous thromboembolism was seen to a lesser extent with \n\nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone.  \n\n \n\nIn patients with multiple myeloma, , treatment with lenalidomide monotherapy was associated with a \n\nlower risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary \n\nembolism) than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide in combination therapy \n\n(see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated \n\nwith an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (predominantly myocardial infarction and \n\ncerebrovascular event) and was seen to a lesser extent with lenalidomide in combination with \n\nmelphalan and prednisone. The risk of arterial thromboembolismis lower in patients with multiple \n\nmyeloma treated with lenalidomide monotherapy than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with \n\nlenalidomide in combination therapy. \n\n \n\nConsequently, patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – including prior thrombosis – \n\nshould be closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g. \n\nsmoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or \n\nprevious history of thromboembolic events may also increase thrombotic risk in these patients. \n\nTherefore, erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as \n\nhormone replacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving \n\nlenalidomide with dexamethasone. A haemoglobin concentration above 12 g/dl should lead to \n\ndiscontinuation of erythropoietic agents. \n\n \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nPatients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of \n\nbreath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. Prophylactic antithrombotic medicines  should be \n\nrecommended, especially in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. The decision to take \n\nantithrombotic prophylactic measures should be made after careful assessment of an individual \n\npatient’s underlying risk factors. \n\n \n\nIf the patient experiences any thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued and standard \n\nanticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation treatment \n\nand any complications of the thromboembolic event have been managed, the lenalidomide treatment \n\nmay be restarted at the original dose dependent upon a benefit risk assessment. The patient should \n\ncontinue anticoagulation therapy during the course of lenalidomide treatment. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n\nThe major dose limiting toxicities of lenalidomide include neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. A \n\ncomplete blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential count, platelet count, \n\nhaemoglobin, and haematocrit should be performed at baseline, every week for the first 8 weeks of \n\nlenalidomide treatment and monthly thereafter to monitor for cytopenias. \n\nIn follicular lymphoma, the monitoring scheme should be weekly for the first 3 weeks of cycle 1 (28 \n\ndays), every 2 weeks during cycles 2 through 4, and then at the start of each cycle thereafter. A dose \n\ninterruption and/or a dose reduction may be required (see section 4.2).  \n\n  \n\nIn case of neutropenia, the physician should consider the use of growth factors in patient management. \n\nPatients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes.  \n\nPatients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including \n\npetechiae and epistaxis, especially in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to \n\ninduce bleeding (see section 4.8, Haemorrhagic disorders). \n\nCo-administration of lenalidomide with other myelosuppressive agents should be undertaken with \n\ncaution. \n\n \n\n Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with \nlenalidomide maintenance \n\nThe adverse reactions from CALGB 100104 included events reported post-high dose melphalan and \n\nASCT (HDM/ASCT) as well as events from the maintenance treatment period. A second analysis \n\nidentified events that occurred after the start of maintenance treatment. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse \n\nreactions were from the maintenance treatment period only. \n\n \n\nOverall, Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance \n\narms compared to the placebo maintenance arms in the 2 studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance \n\nin NDMM patients who have undergone ASCT (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of \n\nmaintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). \n\nTreatment-emergent AEs of neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in \n\n2.2% of patients in CALGB 100104 and 2.4% of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 \n\nfebrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms \n\ncompared to placebo maintenance arms in both studies (0.4% vs 0.5% [0.4% vs 0.5% after the start of \n\nmaintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients \n\nshould be advised to promptly report febrile episodes, a treatment interruption and/or dose reductions \n\nmay be required (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance \n\narms compared to the placebo maintenance arms in studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance in \n\nNDMM patients who have undergone ASCT (37.5% vs 30.3% [17.9% vs 4.1% after the start of \n\nmaintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). \n\nPatients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including \n\npetechiae and epistaxes, especially in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to \n\ninduce bleeding (see section 4.8, Haemorrhagic disorders). \n\n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \nlenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\n \n\nGrade 4 neutropenia was observed at a lower frequency in the lenalidomide in combination with \n\nbortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) arm compared to the Rd comparator arm (2.7% vs 5.9%) in the \n\nSWOG S0777 study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the RVd arm \n\nand Rd arm (0.0% vs 0.4%). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes; a \n\ntreatment interruption and/or dose reduction may be required (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the RVd arm compared to the \n\nRd comparator arm (17.2 % vs 9.4%). \n\n \n\n \n\n Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \nlenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone \n\nGrade 4 neutropenia was observed in the lenalidomide arms in combination with  dexamethasone to a \n\nlesser extent than in the comparator arm (8.5% in the Rd [continuous treatment] and Rd18 [treatment \n\nfor 18 four-week cycles] compared with 15% in the melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide arm, see \n\nsection 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were consistent with the comparator arm (0.6 % in \n\nthe Rd and Rd18 lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared with 0.7% in the \n\nmelphalan/prednisone/thalidomide arm, see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed to a lesser extent in the Rd and Rd18 arms than in the \n\ncomparator arm (8.1% vs 11.1%, respectively).  \n\n \n\n Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in clinical trials of newly diagnosed \n\nmultiple myeloma patients is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1% in \n\nmelphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide arm followed by lenalidomide [MPR+R] and melphalan, \n\nprednisone and lenalidomide followed by placebo [MPR+p] treated patients compared with 7.8% in \n\nMPp+p-treated patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed \n\ninfrequently (1.7% in MPR+R/MPR+p treated patients compared to 0.0 % in MPp+p treated patients; \n\nsee section 4.8). \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in multiple myeloma patients is \n\nassociated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (40.4% in \n\nMPR+R/MPR+p treated patients, compared with 13.7% in MPp+p-treated patients; see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy \nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients with at least one \n\nprior therapy is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared with 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated \n\npatients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed infrequently (0.6% in \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone treated \n\npatients; see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with \n\na higher incidence of grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in \n\nplacebo/dexamethasone-treated patients; see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n Follicular lymphoma \nThe combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma patients is associated with a \n\nhigher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia compared with patients on the placebo/rituximab arm. \n\nFebrile neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia were more commonly observed in the \n\nlenalidomide/ rituximab arm (see section 4.8).  \n\n\n\n 17 \n\n \n\nThyroid disorders \n\nCases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported. Optimal control of \n\nco-morbid conditions influencing thyroid function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline \n\nand ongoing monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\nLenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is known to induce severe peripheral \n\nneuropathy. There was no increase in peripheral neuropathy observed with lenalidomide in \n\ncombination with dexamethasone or melphalan and prednisone or lenalidomide monotherapy or with \n\nlong term use of lenalidomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone in multiple \n\nmyeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of peripheral neuropathy. The frequency was \n\nlower when bortezomib was administered subcutaneously. For additional information, see Section 4.8 \n\nand the SmPC for bortezomib. \n\nTumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome \n\nBecause lenalidomide has anti-neoplastic activity the complications of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) \n\nmay occur. TLS and tumour flare reaction (TFR) have commonly been observed in patients with \n\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and uncommonly in patients with lymphomas, who were treated \n\nwith lenalidomide. Fatal instances of TLS have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. The \n\npatients at risk of TLS and TFR are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. Caution should \n\nbe practiced when introducing these patients to lenalidomide. These patients should be monitored \n\nclosely, especially during the first cycle or dose-escalation, and appropriate precautions taken. There \n\nhave been rare reports of TLS in patients with MM treated with lenalidomide. \n\n \n\n Follicular lymphoma  \nCareful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Tumour flare may mimic PD. Patients \n\nwho experienced Grade 1 and 2 TFR were treated with corticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic \n\nanalgesics for management of TFR symptoms. The decision to take therapeutic measures for TFR \n\nshould be made after careful clinical assessment of the individual patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nCareful monitoring and evaluation for TLS is recommended.  Patients should be well hydrated and \n\nreceive TLS prophylaxis, in addition to weekly chemistry panels during the first cycle or longer, as \n\nclinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nCases of allergic reaction/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients treated with \n\nlenalidomide (see section 4.8). Patients who had previous allergic reactions while treated with \n\nthalidomide should be monitored closely, as a possible cross-reaction between lenalidomide and \n\nthalidomide has been reported in the literature.  \n\n \n\nSevere skin reactions \n\nSevere cutaneous reactions including SJS, and TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of \n\nlenalidomide. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their \n\nprescribers and should be told to seek medical attention immediately if they develop these \n\nsymptoms. Lenalidomide must be discontinued for exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or \n\nDRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed following discontinuation for these reactions. \n\nInterruption or discontinuation of lenalidomide should be considered for other forms of skin reaction \n\ndepending on severity. Patients with a history of severe rash associated with thalidomide treatment \n\nshould not receive lenalidomide. \n\n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nSecond primary malignancies \n\nAn increase of second primary malignancies (SPM) has been observed in clinical trials in previously \n\ntreated myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide/dexamethasone (3.98 per 100 person-years) \n\ncompared to controls (1.38 per 100 person-years). Non-invasive SPM comprise basal cell or squamous \n\ncell skin cancers. Most of the invasive SPMs were solid tumour malignancies. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients not eligible for transplant, a 4.9-fold \n\nincrease in incidence rate of hematologic SPM (cases of acute myeloid leukaemia [AML], \n\nmyelodysplastic syndrome [MDS)]) has been observed in patients receiving lenalidomide in \n\ncombination with melphalan and prednisone until progression (1.75 per 100 person-years) compared \n\nwith melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.36 per 100 person-years).  \n\n \n\nA 2.12-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving \n\nlenalidomide (9 cycles) in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.57 per 100 person-years) \n\ncompared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.74 per 100 person-years).  \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 \n\nmonths, the hematologic SPM incidence rate (0.16 per 100 person-years) was not increased as \n\ncompared to thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (0.79 per 100 person-years).  \n\n \n\nA 1.3-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving \n\nlenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 months (1.58 per 100 \n\nperson-years) compared to thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.19 per 100 \n\nperson-years). \n\n \n\nIn newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with \n\nbortezomib and dexamethasone, the hematologic SPM incidence rate was 0.00 – 0.16 per 100 person-\n\nyears and the incidence rate of solid tumour SPM 0.21 – 1.04 per 100 person-years. \n\n \n\nThe increased risk of secondary primary malignancies associated with lenalidomide is relevant also in \n\nthe context of NDMM after stem cell transplantation. Though this risk is not yet fully characterized, it \n\nshould be kept in mind when considering and using lenalidomide  in this setting. \n\n \n\nThe incidence rate of hematologic malignancies, most notably AML, MDS and B-cell malignancies \n\n(including Hodgkin’s lymphoma), was 1.31 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 0.58 \n\nper 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.02 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to \n\nlenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after \n\nASCT). The incidence rate of solid tumour SPMs was 1.36 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide \n\narms and 1.05 per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.26 per 100 person-years for patients \n\nexposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to \n\nlenalidomide after ASCT).   \n\n \n\nThe risk of occurrence of hematologic SPM must be taken into account before initiating treatment \n\nwith lenalidomide either in combination with melphalan or immediately following high-dose \n\nmelphalan and ASCT. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during treatment using \n\nstandard cancer screening for occurrence of SPM and institute treatment as indicated. \n\n \n\nSecond primary malignancies in follicular lymphoma \n\nIn a relapsed/refractory iNHL study which included follicular lymphoma patients, no increased risk of \n\nSPMs in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to the placebo/rituximab arm, was observed. \n\nHematologic SPM of AML occurred in 0.29 per 100 person-years in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm \n\ncompared with 0.29 per 100 person-years in patients receiving placebo/rituximab. The incidence rate \n\nof hematologic plus solid tumour SPMs (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) was 0.87 per 100 \n\nperson-years in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to 1.17 per 100 person-years in patients \n\nreceiving placebo/rituximab with a median follow-up of 30.59 months (range 0.6 to 50.9 months).  \n\n \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancers are identified risks and comprise squamous cell carcinomas of skin or \n\nbasal cell carcinomas. \n\n \n\nPhysicians should monitor patients for the development of SPMs. Both the potential benefit of \n\nlenalidomide and the risk of SPMs should be considered when considering treatment with \n\nlenalidomide. \n\n \n\nHepatic disorders \n\nHepatic failure, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide in \n\ncombination therapy: acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, and \n\nmixed cytolytic/cholestatic hepatitis have been reported. The mechanisms of severe drug-induced \n\nhepatotoxicity remain unknown although, in some cases, pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated \n\nbaseline liver enzymes, and possibly treatment with antibiotics might be risk factors. \n\n \n\nAbnormal liver function tests were commonly reported and were generally asymptomatic and \n\nreversible upon dosing interruption. Once parameters have returned to baseline, treatment at a lower \n\ndose may be considered.  \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is excreted by the kidneys. It is important to dose adjust patients with renal impairment \n\nin order to avoid plasma levels which may increase the risk for higher haematological adverse \n\nreactions or hepatotoxicity. Monitoring of liver function is recommended, particularly when there is a \n\nhistory of or concurrent viral liver infection or when lenalidomide is combined with medicinal \n\nproducts known to be associated with liver dysfunction. \n\n \n\nInfection with or without neutropenia \n\nPatients with multiple myeloma are prone to develop infections including pneumonia. A higher rate of \n\ninfections was observed with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone than with MPT in \n\npatients with NDMM who are not eligible for transplant, and with lenalidomide maintenance \n\ncompared to placebo in patients with NDMM who had undergone ASCT. Grade ≥ 3 infections \n\noccurred within the context of neutropenia in less than one-third of the patients. Patients with known \n\nrisk factors for infections should be closely monitored. All patients should be advised to seek medical \n\nattention promptly at the first sign of infection (eg, cough, fever, etc) thereby allowing for early \n\nmanagement to reduce severity. \n\n \n\nViral reactivation \n\nCases of viral reactivation have been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, including serious \n\ncases of herpes zoster or hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. \n\n \n\nSome of the cases of viral reactivation had a fatal outcome. \n\n \n\nSome of the cases of herpes zoster reactivation resulted in disseminated herpes zoster, meningitis \n\nherpes zoster or ophthalmic herpes zoster requiring a temporary hold or permanent discontinuation of \n\nthe treatment with lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. \n\n \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B has been reported rarely in patients receiving lenalidomide who have \n\npreviously been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Some of these cases have progressed to \n\nacute hepatic failure resulting in discontinuation of lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. \n\nHepatitis B virus status should be established before initiating treatment with lenalidomide. For \n\npatients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the \n\ntreatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when lenalidomide is used in \n\npatients previously infected with HBV, including patients who are anti-HBc positive but HBsAg \n\nnegative. These patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection \n\nthroughout therapy. \n\n \n\n Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients \nThere was a higher rate of intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, \n\ndiscontinuation) in patients with age > 75 years, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≤2 or CLcr<60 mL/min when \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nlenalidomide is given in combination. Patients should be carefully assessed for their ability to tolerate \n\nlenalidomide in combination, with consideration to age, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≤2 or CLcr<60 \n\nmL/min (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nCataract \n\nCataract has been reported with a higher frequency in patients receiving lenalidomide in combination \n\nwith dexamethasone particularly when used for a prolonged time. Regular monitoring of visual ability \n\nis recommended. \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n\nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have been reported \n\nwith lenalidomide. PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with \n\nlenalidomide. Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or \n\nprior treatment with other immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should monitor patients at \n\nregular intervals and should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or \n\nworsening neurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. Patients should also \n\nbe advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms \n\nthat the patient is not aware of.  \n\n \n\nThe evaluation for PML should be based on neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging of \n\nthe brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction \n\n(PCR) or a brain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional \n\nfollow-up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established.  \n\n \n\nIf PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is \n\nconfirmed, lenalidomide must be permanently discontinued. \n\n \n\nLactose intolerance \n\nLenalidomide Accord hard capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \n\ngalactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \n\nmedicinal product.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nErythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone \n\nreplacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide \n\nwith dexamethasone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nOral contraceptives \n\nNo interaction study has been performed with oral contraceptives. Lenalidomide is not an enzyme \n\ninducer. In an in vitro study with human hepatocytes, lenalidomide, at various concentrations tested \n\ndid not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Therefore, induction leading \n\nto reduced efficacy of medicinal products, including hormonal contraceptives, is not expected if \n\nlenalidomide is administered alone. However, dexamethasone is known to be a weak to moderate \n\ninducer of CYP3A4 and is likely to also affect other enzymes as well as transporters. It may not be \n\nexcluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during treatment. Effective measures \n\nto avoid pregnancy must be taken (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nCo-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of lenalidomide had no effect on the single dose \n\npharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin. Co-administration of a single 25 mg dose of warfarin had no \n\neffect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide. However, it is not known whether there is an \n\ninteraction during clinical use (concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Dexamethasone is a weak \n\nto moderate enzyme inducer and its effect on warfarin is unknown. Close monitoring of warfarin \n\nconcentration is advised during the treatment. \n\n \n\nDigoxin \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nConcomitant administration with lenalidomide 10 mg once daily increased the plasma exposure of \n\ndigoxin (0.5 mg, single dose) by 14% with a 90% CI (confidence interval) [0.52%-28.2%]. It is not \n\nknown whether the effect will be different in the clinical use (higher lenalidomide doses and \n\nconcomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Therefore, monitoring of the digoxin concentration is \n\nadvised during lenalidomide treatment. \n\n \n\nStatins \n\nThere is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when statins are administered with lenalidomide, which \n\nmay be simply additive. Enhanced clinical and laboratory monitoring is warranted notably during the \n\nfirst weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nDexamethasone \n\nCo-administration of single or multiple doses of dexamethasone (40 mg once daily) has no clinically \n\nrelevant effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg once daily). \n\n \n\nInteractions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors \n\nIn vitro, lenalidomide is a substrate of P-gp, but is not a P-gp inhibitor. Co-administration of multiple \n\ndoses of the strong P-gp inhibitor quinidine (600 mg, twice daily) or the moderate P-gp \n\ninhibitor/substrate temsirolimus (25 mg) has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nlenalidomide (25 mg). Co-administration of lenalidomide does not alter the pharmacokinetics of \n\ntemsirolimus. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nDue to the teratogenic potential, lenalidomide must be prescribed under a Pregnancy Prevention \n\nProgramme (see section 4.4) unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have \n\nchildbearing potential. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective method of contraception. If pregnancy occurs in \n\na woman treated with lenalidomide, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a \n\nphysician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. If pregnancy occurs in a \n\npartner of a male patient taking lenalidomide, it is recommended to refer the female partner to a \n\nphysician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable \n\nin human semen 3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a \n\nprecaution, and taking into account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal \n\nimpairment, all male patients taking lenalidomide should use condoms throughout treatment duration, \n\nduring dose interruption and for 1 week after cessation of treatment if their partner is pregnant or of \n\nchildbearing potential and has no contraception. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nLenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active \n\nsubstance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide induced malformation in monkeys similar to those described with thalidomide (see \n\nsection 5.3). Therefore, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide is expected and lenalidomide is \n\ncontraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether lenalidomide is excreted in breast milk. Therefore breast-feeding should be \n\ndiscontinued during therapy with lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nA fertility study in rats with lenalidomide doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 200 to 500 times the \n\nhuman doses of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively, based on body surface area) produced no adverse \n\n\n\n 22 \n\neffects on fertility and no parental toxicity. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nLenalidomide has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, \n\ndizziness, somnolence, vertigo and blurred vision have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. \n\nTherefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide \n\nmaintenance \n\nA conservative approach was applied to determine the adverse reactions from CALGB 100104. The \n\nadverse reactions described in Table 1 included events reported post-HDM/ASCT as well as events \n\nfrom the maintenance treatment period. A second analysis that identified events that occurred after the \n\nstart of maintenance treatment suggests that the frequencies described in Table 1 may be higher than \n\nactually observed during the maintenance treatment period. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse reactions \n\nwere from the maintenance treatment period only. \n\n \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with lenalidomide maintenance than \n\nplacebo were: \n\n Pneumonia (10.6%; combined term) from IFM 2005-02 \n\n Lung infection (9.4% [9.4% after the start of maintenance treatment]) from CALGB 100104 \n \n\nIn the IFM 2005-02 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide \n\nmaintenance than placebo were neutropenia (60.8%), bronchitis (47.4%), diarrhoea (38.9%), \n\nnasopharyngitis (34.8%), muscle spasms (33.4%), leucopenia (31.7%), asthenia (29.7%), cough \n\n(27.3%), thrombocytopenia (23.5%), gastroenteritis (22.5%) and pyrexia (20.5%). \n\n \n\nIn the CALGB 100104 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide \n\nmaintenance than placebo were neutropenia (79.0% [71.9% after the start of maintenance treatment]), \n\nthrombocytopenia (72.3% [61.6%]), diarrhoea (54.5% [46.4%]), rash (31.7% [25.0%]), upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection (26.8% [26.8%]), fatigue (22.8% [17.9%]), leucopenia (22.8% [18.8%]) and \n\nanaemia (21.0% [13.8%]). \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving lenalidomide \n\nin combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nIn the SWOG S0777 study, the serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥ 5%) with \n\nlenalidomide in combination with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone than with lenalidomide \n\nin combination with dexamethasone were:  \n\n Hypotension (6.5%), lung infection (5.7%), dehydration (5.0%) \n \n\nThe adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib \n\nand dexamethasone than with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone were: Fatigue \n\n(73.7%), peripheral neuropathy (71.8%), thrombocytopenia (57.6%), constipation (56.1%), \n\nhypocalcaemia (50.0%).  \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \n\nlenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with lenalidomide in combination with \n\nlow dose dexamethasone (Rd and Rd18) than with melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) \n\nwere: \n\n Pneumonia (9.8%) \n\n Renal failure (including acute) (6.3%) \n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nThe adverse reactions observed more frequently with Rd or Rd18 than MPT were: diarrhoea (45.5%), \n\nfatigue (32.8%), back pain (32.0%), asthenia (28.2%), insomnia (27.6%), rash (24.3%), decreased \n\nappetite (23.1%), cough (22.7%), pyrexia (21.4%), and muscle spasms (20.5%). \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \n\nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with melphalan, prednisone and \n\nlenalidomide followed by lenalidomide maintenance (MPR+R) or melphalan, prednisone and \n\nlenalidomide followed by placebo (MPR+p) than melphalan, prednisone and placebo followed by \n\nplacebo (MPp+p) were: \n\n Febrile neutropenia (6.0%) \n\n Anaemia  (5.3%) \n \n\nThe adverse reactions observed more frequently with MPR+R or MPR+p than MPp+p were: \n\nneutropenia (83.3%), anaemia  (70.7%), thrombocytopenia (70.0%), leucopenia (38.8%), constipation \n\n(34.0%), diarrhoea (33.3%), rash (28.9%), pyrexia (27.0%), peripheral oedema (25.0%), cough \n\n(24.0%), decreased appetite (23.7%), and asthenia (22.0%). \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy \n\nIn two phase III placebo-controlled studies, 353 patients with multiple myeloma were exposed to the \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone combination and 351 to the placebo/dexamethasone combination.  \n\n \n\nThe most serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in lenalidomide/dexamethasone than \n\nplacebo/dexamethasone combination were: \n\n Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.4) \n\n Grade 4 neutropenia (see section 4.4). \n \n\nThe observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently with lenalidomide and \n\ndexamethasone than placebo and dexamethasone in pooled multiple myeloma clinical trials (MM-009 \n\nand MM-010) were fatigue (43.9%), neutropenia (42.2%), constipation (40.5%), diarrhoea (38.5%), \n\nmuscle cramp (33.4%), anaemia (31.4%), thrombocytopenia (21.5%), and rash (21.2%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions observed in patients treated with lenalidomide are listed below by system organ \n\nclass and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions have been included under the appropriate category in the table below according to \n\nthe highest frequency observed in any of the main clinical trials. \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma  \n\nThe overall safety profile of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in patients with previously \n\ntreated follicular lymphoma is based on data from 294 patients from a Phase 3 randomised, controlled \n\nstudy NHL-007. Additionally, adverse drug reactions from supportive study NHL-008 have been \n\nincluded in Table 5. \n\n \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed most frequently (with a difference of at least 1 percentage \n\npoint) in study NHL-007 in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm compared with the placebo/rituximab arm \n\nwere: \n\n Febrile neutropenia (2.7%) \n\n Pulmonary embolism (2.7%) \n\n Pneumonia (2.7%) \n \n\nIn the NHL-007 study the adverse reactions observed more frequently in the lenalidomide/rituximab \n\narm compared with the placebo/rituximab arm (with at least 2% higher frequency between arms) were \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nneutropenia (58.2%), diarrhoea (30.8%), leucopenia (28.8%), constipation (21.9%), cough (21.9%)  \n\nand fatigue (21.9%). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary for monotherapy in MM \n\nThe following table is derived from data gathered during NDMM studies in patients who have \n\nundergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide maintenance.

Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active \n\nsubstance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. In monkeys , lenalidomide induced \n\nmalformations similar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide \n\nis taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide \n\nmaintenance \n\nLenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia \n\ncompared to placebo maintenance (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of maintenance \n\ntreatment] in CALGB 100104 and 16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Treatment-emergent \n\nAEs of neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 2.2% of patients in \n\nCALGB 100104 and 2.4% of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively.  Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was \n\nreported at similar frequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms compared to placebo \n\nmaintenance arms in both studies (0.4% vs 0.5% [0.4% vs 0.5% after the start of maintenance \n\ntreatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). \n\n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nLenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 \n\nthrombocytopenia compared to placebo maintenance (37.5% vs 30.3% [17.9% vs 4.1% after the start \n\nof maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). \n\n \n\n Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving \nlenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nGrade 4 neutropenia was observed in the RVd arm to a lesser extent than in the Rd comparator arm \n\n(2.7% vs 5.9%) in the SWOG S0777 study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar \n\nfrequencies in the RVd arm compared to the Rd arm (0.0% vs 0.4%).  \n\n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in the RVd arm to a greater extent than in the Rd \n\ncomparator arm (17.2 % vs 9.4%). \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \n\nlenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients \n\nis associated with a lower frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (8.5% in Rd and Rd18, compared with \n\nMPT (15%). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was observed infrequently (0.6% in Rd and Rd18 compared \n\nwith 0.7% in MPT). \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide withdexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients \n\nis associated with a lower frequency of Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (8.1% in Rd and Rd18) \n\ncompared with MPT (11%). \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \n\nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple \n\nmyeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1% in \n\nMPR+R/MPR+p) compared with MPp+p (7.8%). There was a higher frequency of grade 4 febrile \n\nneutropenia observed (1.7% in MPR+R/MPR+p compared to 0.0% in MPp+p).  \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple \n\nmyeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia \n\n(40.4% in MPR+R/MPR+p) compared with MPp+p (13.7%).  \n\nMultiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with \n\na higher incidence of grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients \n\ncompared with 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes \n\nwere observed infrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 0.0% \n\nin placebo/dexamethasone treated patients). \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with \n\na higher incidence of grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in \n\nplacebo/dexamethasone-treated patients). \n\n \n\n Follicular lymphoma patients \nThe combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma is associated with a higher \n\nrate of grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia (50.7% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared \n\nwith 12.2% in placebo/rituximab treated patients). All grade 3 or 4 neutropenia were reversible \n\nthrough dose interruption, reduction and/or supportive care with growth factors. Additionally, febrile \n\nneutropenia was observed infrequently (2.7% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared \n\nwith 0.7% in placebo/rituximab treated patients).   \n\n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nLenalidomide in combination with rituximab is also associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or \n\n4 thrombocytopenia (1.4% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared to 0% in \n\nplacebo/rituximab patients).  \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n\nAn increased risk of DVT and PE is associated with the use of the combination of lenalidomide with \n\ndexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma, and to a lesser extent in patients treated with \n\nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone or in patients with multiple myeloma, \n\ntreated with lenalidomide monotherapy (see section 4.5).  \n\nConcomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or previous history of DVT may also increase \n\nthrombotic risk in these patients. \n\n \n\nMyocardial infarction \n\nMyocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with \n\nknown risk factors. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhagic disorders \n\nHaemorrhagic disorders are listed under several system organ classes: Blood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders; nervous system disorders (intracranial haemorrhage); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders (epistaxis); gastrointestinal disorders (gingival bleeding, haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, rectal \n\nhaemorrhage); renal and urinary disorders (haematuria); injury, poisoning and procedural \n\ncomplications (contusion) and vascular disorders (ecchymosis). \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nCases of allergic reaction/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. A possible cross-reaction \n\nbetween lenalidomide and thalidomide has been reported in the literature. \n\n \n\nSevere skin reactions \n\nSevere cutaneous reactions including SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of \n\nlenalidomide. Patients with a history of severe rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not \n\nreceive lenalidomide (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSecond primary malignancies \n\nIn clinical trials in previously treated myeloma patients with lenalidomide/dexamethasone compared \n\nto controls, mainly comprising of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia  \n\nMultiple myeloma \n\nCases of AML have been observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients \n\ntaking lenalidomide treatment in combination with melphalan or immediately following HDM/ASCT \n\n(see section 4.4). This increase was not observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple \n\nmyeloma in patients taking lenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone compared to \n\nthalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone. \n\n \n\nHepatic disorders \n\nThe following post-marketing adverse reactions have been reported (frequency unknown): acute \n\nhepatic failure and cholestasis (both potentially fatal), toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, mixed \n\ncytolytic/cholestatic hepatitis. \n\n \nRhabdomyolysis \n\nRare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been observed, some of them when lenalidomide is administered \n\nwith a statin. \n\n \nThyroid disorders  \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nCases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported (see section 4.4 Thyroid \n\ndisorders). \n\n \n\nTumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome \n\n \n\nIn study NHL-007, TFR was reported in 19/146 (13.0%) of patients in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm \n\nversus 1/148 (0.7%) patients in the placebo/rituximab arm. Most TFRs (18 out of 19) reported in the \n\nlenalidomide/rituximab arm occurred during first two cycles of treatment. One FL patient in the \n\nlenalidomide/rituximab arm experienced a Grade 3 TFR event versus no patients in the \n\nplacebo/rituximab arm. In study NHL-008, 7/177 (4.0%) of FL patients experienced TFR; (3 reports \n\nwere Grade 1 and 4 reports were Grade 2 severity); while 1 report was considered serious. In study \n\nNHL-007, TLS occurred in 2 FL patients (1.4%) in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm and no FL patients \n\nin the placebo/rituximab arm; neither patient had a Grade 3 or 4 event. TLS occurred in 1 FL patient \n\n(0.6%) in study NHL-008. This single event was identified as a serious, Grade 3 adverse reaction. For \n\nstudy NHL-007 no patients had to discontinue lenalidomide/rituximab therapy due to TFR or TLS. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nGastrointestinal perforations have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. Gastrointestinal \n\nperforations may lead to septic complications and may be associated with fatal outcome. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nThere is no specific experience in the management of lenalidomide overdose in patients, although in \n\ndose-ranging studies some patients were exposed to up to 150 mg, and in single-dose studies, some \n\npatients were exposed to up to 400 mg. The DLT in these studies was essentially haematological. In \n\nthe event of overdose, supportive care is advised.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Other immunosuppressants. ATC code: L04AX04. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nLenalidomide binds directly to cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme \n\ncomplex that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 4 \n\n(CUL4), and regulator of cullins 1 (Roc1). In haematopoietic cells, lenalidomide binding to cereblon \n\nrecruits substrate proteins Aiolos and Ikaros lymphoid transcriptional factors, leading to their \n\nubiquitination and subsequent degradation resulting in direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory \n\neffects. \n\n \n\nSpecifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis of certain haematopoietic \n\ntumour cells (including MM plasma tumour cells and follicular lymphoma tumour cells), enhances T \n\ncell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and increases the number of NK, T and NK T \n\ncells. The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab increases ADCC and direct tumor apoptosis in \n\nfollicular lymphoma cells. \n\n \n\nThe lenalidomide mechanism of action also includes additional activities such as anti-angiogenic and \n\npro-erythropoietic properties. Lenalidomide inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 35 \n\nadhesion of endothelial cells and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin \n\nproduction by CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory \n\ncytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nLenalidomide efficacy and safety have been evaluated in five phase III studies in newly diagnosed \n\nmultiple myeloma, two phase III studies in relapsed refractory multiple myelomaas and one phase 3 \n\nand one phase 3b study in iNHL described below. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myelomaLenalidomide maintenance in patients who have undergone ASCT \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance was assessed in two phase 3 multicentre, \n\nrandomised, double-blind 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled studies: CALGB 100104 and IFM \n\n2005-02 \n\n \n\nCALGB 100104 \n\nPatients between 18 and 70 years of age with active MM requiring treatment and without prior \n\nprogression after initial therapy were eligible. \n\n \n\nPatients were randomised 1:1 within 90-100 days after ASCT to receive either lenalidomide or placebo \n\nmaintenance. The maintenance dose was 10 mg once daily on days 1-28 of repeated 28-day cycles \n\n(increased up to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity), and \n\ntreatment was continued until disease progression. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS) from randomisation to \n\nthe date of progression or death, whichever occurred first; the study was not powered for the overall \n\nsurvival endpoint. In total 460 patients were randomised: 231 patients to lenalidomide and 229 patients \n\nto placebo. The demographic and disease-related characteristics were balanced across both arms. \n\n \n\nThe study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after \n\nsurpassing the threshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients in the \n\nplacebo arm were allowed to cross over to receive lenalidomide before disease progression. \n\n \n\nThe results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 17 \n\nDecember 2009 (15.5 months follow up) showed a 62% reduction in risk of disease progression or \n\ndeath favouring lenalidomide (HR = 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.54; p <0.001). The median overall PFS was \n\n33.9 months (95% CI NE, NE) in the lenalidomide arm versus 19.0 months (95% CI 16.2, 25.6) in the \n\nplacebo arm.  \n\n \n\nThe PFS benefit was observed both in the subgroup of patients with CR and in the subgroup of \n\npatients who had not achieved a CR. \n\n \n\nThe results for the study, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016, are presented in Table 4 \n\n \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nTable 5: Summary of overall efficacy data \n\n Lenalidomide \n\n(N = 231) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N = 229) \n\nInvestigator-assessed PFS   \n\nMediana PFS time, months (95% CI)b 56.9 (41.9, 71.7) 29,4 (20.7, 35.5) \n\nHR [95% CI]c; p-valued 0.61 (0.48, 0.76); <0.001 \n\nPFS2e   \n\nMediana PFS2 time, months (95% CI) b 80.2 (63.3, 101.8) 52.8 (41.3, 64.0) \n\nHR [95% CI]c ; p-valued 0.61 (0.48, 0.78); <0.001 \n\nOverall survival   \n\nMediana OS time, months (95% CI)b 111.0 (101.8, NE) 84.2 (71.0, 102.7) \n\n8-year survival rate, % (SE) 60.9 (3.78) 44.6 (3.98) \n\nHR [95% CI]c ; p-valued 0.61 (0.46, 0.81); <0.001 \n\nFollow-up   \n\nMedianf (min, max), months: all surviving patients 81.9 (0.0, 119.8) 81.0 (4.1, 119.5) \nCI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; max = maximum; min = minimum; NE = not estimable; OS = overall survival; \n\nPFS = progression-free survival;  \na The median is based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate. \nb The 95% CI about the median. \nc Based on Cox proportional hazards model comparing the hazard functions associated with the indicated treatment arms. \nd The p-value is based on the unstratified log-rank test of Kaplan-Meier curve differences between the indicated treatment arms. \ne Exploratory endpoint (PFS2).

In total 614 \n\npatients were randomised: 307 patients to lenalidomide and 307 patients to placebo. \n\n \n\nThe study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after \n\nsurpassing the threshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients receiving \n\nplacebo were not crossed over to lenalidomide therapy prior to progressive disease. The lenalidomide \n\narm was discontinued, as a proactive safety measure, after observing an imbalance of SPMs (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 7 July \n\n2010 (31.4 months follow up) showed a 48% reduction in risk of disease progression or death favoring \n\nlenalidomide (HR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.41, 0.66; p <0.001). The median overall PFS was 40.1 months \n\n(95% CI 35.7, 42.4) in the lenalidomide arm versus 22.8 months (95% CI 20.7, 27.4) in the placebo \n\narm. \n\n \n\nThe PFS benefit was less in the subgroup of patients with CR than in the subgroup of patients who had \n\nnot achieved a CR. \n\n \n\nThe updated PFS, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016 (96.7 months follow up) continues to show a PFS \n\nadvantage: HR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.47, 0.68; p < 0.001). The median overall PFS was 44.4 months (39.6, \n\n52.0) in the lenalidomide arm versus 23.8 months (95% CI 21.2, 27.3) in the placebo arm. For PFS2, \n\nthe observed HR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.66, 0.98; p = 0.026) for lenalidomide versus placebo. The \n\nmedian overall PFS2 was 69.9 months (95% CI 58.1, 80.0) in the lenalidomide arm versus 58.4 \n\nmonths (95% CI 51.1, 65.0) in the placebo arm. For OS, the observed HR was 0.90: (95% CI 0.72, \n\n1.13; p = 0.355) for lenalidomide versus placebo. The median overall survival time was 105.9 months \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n(95% CI 88.8, NE) in the lenalidomide arm versus 88.1 months (95% CI 80.7, 108.4) in the placebo \n\narm. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who are not eligible \n\nfor stem cell transplantation \n\nThe SWOG S0777 study evaluated the addition of bortezomib to a foundation of lenalidomide and \n\ndexamethasone, as initial treatment, followed by continued Rd until disease progression, in patients \n\nwith previously untreated multiple myeloma who are either ineligible for transplant or eligible for \n\ntransplant with no plan to undertake immediate transplant.  \n \nPatients in the lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) arm received lenalidomide \n\n25 mg/day orally on days 1-14, intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and \n\ndexamethasone 20 mg/day orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of repeated 21-day cycles for up to \n\neight 21-day cycles (24 weeks). Patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) arm received \n\nlenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on days 1-21, and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on days 1, 8, 15, \n\nand 22 of repeated 28-day cycles for up to six 21-day cycles (24 weeks). Patients in both arms took \n\ncontinued Rd: lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on \n\ndays 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles. Treatment was to be continued until disease \n\nprogression. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 523 patients \n\nwere enrolled into the study, with 263 patients randomised to RVd and 260 patients randomised to Rd. \n\nThe demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the patients were well balanced \n\nbetween arms.  \n\n \n\nThe results of PFS, as assessed by IRAC, at the time of the primary analysis, using a cut-off of 05 \n\nNovember 2015 (50.6 months follow up) showed a 24% reduction in risk of disease progression or \n\ndeath favouring RVd (HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.61, 0.94; p = 0.010). The median overall PFS was 42.5 \n\nmonths (95% CI 34.0, 54.8) in the RVd arm versus 29.9 months (95% CI 25.6, 38.2) in the Rd arm. \n\nThe benefit was observed regardless of eligibility for stem cell transplant. \n\n \n\nThe results for the study, using a cut-off of 01 December 2016, where the median follow-up time for \n\nall surviving subjects was 69.0 months, are presented in Table 8.

Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Patients were \n\nstratified at randomisation by age (≤75 versus >75 years), stage (ISS Stages I and II versus Stage III), \n\nand country. \n\n \n\nPatients in the Rd and Rd18 arms took lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 of 28-day cycles \n\naccording to protocol arm. Dexamethasone 40 mg was dosed once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of \n\neach 28-day cycle. Initial dose and regimen for Rd and Rd18 were adjusted according to age and renal \n\nfunction (see section 4.2). Patients >75 years received a dexamethasone dose of 20 mg once daily on \n\ndays 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. All patients received prophylactic anticoagulation (low \n\nmolecular weight heparin, warfarin, heparin, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid  during the study. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 1623 patients \n\nwere enrolled into the study, with 535 patients randomised to Rd, 541 patients randomised to Rd18 \n\nand 547 patients randomised to MPT. The demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of \n\nthe patients were well balanced in all 3 arms. In general, study subjects had advanced-stage disease: of \n\nthe total study population, 41% had ISS stage III, 9% had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine \n\nclearance [CLcr] < 30 mL/min). The median age was 73 in the 3 arms. \n\n \n\nIn an updated analysis of PFS, PFS2 and OS using a cut off of 3 March 2014 where the median \n\nfollow-up time for all surviving subjects was 45.5 months, the results of the study are presented in \n\nTable 5: \n\n \n\nTable 7.

The study compared lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (MPR) \n\nwith or without lenalidomide maintenance therapy until disease progression, to that of melphalan and \n\nprednisone for a maximum of 9 cycles. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment \n\narms. Patients were stratified at randomisation by age ( 75 vs. > 75 years) and stage (ISS; Stages I \n\nand II vs. stage III). \n\n \n\nThis study investigated the use of combination therapy of MPR (melphalan 0.18 mg/kg orally on days \n\n1 to 4 of repeated 28-day cycles; prednisone 2 mg/kg orally on days 1 to 4 of repeated 28-day cycles; \n\nand lenalidomide 10 mg/day orally on days 1 to 21 of repeated 28-day cycles) for induction therapy, \n\nup to 9 cycles. Patients who completed 9 cycles or who were unable to complete 9 cycles due to \n\nintolerance proceeded to maintenance therapy starting with lenalidomide 10 mg orally on days 1 to 21 \n\nof repeated 28-day cycles until disease progression. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 459 patients \n\nwere enrolled into the study, with 152 patients randomised to MPR+R, 153 patients randomised to \n\nMPR+p and 154 patients randomised to MPp+p. The demographics and disease-related baseline \n\ncharacteristics of the patients were well balanced in all 3 arms; notably, approximately 50% of the \n\npatients enrolled in each arm had the following characteristics; ISS Stage III, and creatinine clearance \n\n< 60 mL/min.

Patients randomised to the \n\nlenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm received lenalidomide 25 mg/day, days 1 to 21 every 28 \n\ndays plus low dose dexamethasone – 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days. In the \n\nlenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone group, 20 patients (9.1%) underwent at least one dose \n\ninterruption compared to 65 patients (29.3%) in the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm. \n\n \n\nIn a post-hoc analysis, lower mortality was observed in the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm \n\n6.8% (15/220) compared to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm 19.3% (43/223), in the \n\nnewly diagnosed multiple myeloma patient population, with a median follow up of 72.3 weeks. \n\n \n\nHowever with a longer follow-up, the difference in overall survival in favour of lenalidomide/ low \n\ndose dexamethasone tends to decrease. \n\n\n\n 41 \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma with at least one prior therapy \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lenalidomide were evaluated in two phase III multi-centre, randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group controlled studies (MM-009 and MM-010) of \n\nlenalidomide plus dexamethasone therapy versus dexamethasone alone in previously treated patients \n\nwith multiple myeloma. Out of 353 patients in the MM-009 and MM-010 studies who received \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone, 45.6% were aged 65 or over. Of the 704 patients evaluated in the \n\nMM-009 and MM-010 studies, 44.6% were aged 65 or over. \n\n \n\nIn both studies, patients in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone (len/dex) group took 25 mg of \n\nlenalidomide orally once daily on days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on days 22 \n\nto 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in the placebo/dexamethasone (placebo/dex) group took 1 placebo \n\ncapsule on days 1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of \n\ndexamethasone orally once daily on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first \n\n4 cycles of therapy. The dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 4 \n\nof each 28-day cycle after the first 4 cycles of therapy. In both studies, treatment was to continue until \n\ndisease progression. In both studies, dose adjustments were allowed based on clinical and laboratory \n\nfinding. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to progression (TTP). In total, 353 patients \n\nwere evaluated in the MM-009 study; 177 in the len/dex group and 176 in the placebo/dex group and, \n\nin total, 351 patients were evaluated in the MM-010 study; 176 in the len/dex group and 175 in the \n\nplacebo/dex group. \n\n \n\nIn both studies, the baseline demographic and disease-related characteristics were comparable between \n\nthe len/dex and placebo/dex groups. Both patient populations presented a median age of 63 years, with \n\na comparable male to female ratio. The ECOG performance status was comparable between both \n\ngroups, as was the number and type of prior therapies. \n\n \n\nPre-planned interim analyses of both studies showed that len/dex was statistically significantly \n\nsuperior (p < 0.00001) to dexamethasone alone for the primary efficacy endpoint, TTP (median \n\nfollow-up duration of 98.0 weeks). Complete response and overall response rates in the len/dex arm \n\nwere also significantly higher than the placebo/dex arm in both studies. Results of these analyses \n\nsubsequently led to an unblinding in both studies, in order to allow patients in the placebo/dex group \n\nto receive treatment with the len/dex combination. \n\n \n\nAn extended follow-up efficacy analysis was conducted with a median follow-up of 130.7 weeks. \n\nTable 7 summarises the results of the follow-up efficacy analyses – pooled studies MM-009 and \n\nMM-010. \n \n\nIn this pooled extended follow-up analysis, the median TTP was 60.1 weeks (95% CI: 44.3, 73.1) in \n\npatients treated with len/dex (N = 353) versus 20.1 weeks (95% CI: 17.7, 20.3) in patients treated with \n\nplacebo/dex (N = 351). The median progression free survival was 48.1 weeks (95% CI: 36.4, 62.1) in \n\npatients treated with len/dex versus 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 16.1, 20.1) in patients treated with \n\nplacebo/dex. The median duration of treatment was 44.0 weeks (min: 0.1, max: 254.9) for len/dex and \n\n23.1 weeks (min: 0.3, max: 238.1) for placebo/dex. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR) \n\nand overall response (CR+PR) rates in the len/dex arm remain significantly higher than in the \n\nplacebo/dex arm in both studies. The median overall survival in the extended follow-up analysis of the \n\npooled studies is 164.3 weeks (95% CI: 145.1, 192.6) in patients treated with len/dex versus 136.4 \n\nweeks (95% CI: 113.1, 161.7) in patients treated with placebo/dex. Despite the fact that 170 out of the \n\n351 patients randomised to placebo/dex received lenalidomide after disease progression or after the \n\nstudies were unblinded, the pooled analysis of overall survival demonstrated a statistically significant \n\nsurvival advantage for len/dex relative to placebo/dex (HR = 0.833, 95% CI = [0.687, 1.009], \n\np=0.045). \n\n \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nTable 9.

All \n\ndosage calculations for rituximab were based on the patient’s body surface area (BSA), using actual \n\npatient weight. \n\n \n\nThe demographic and disease-related baseline characteristics were similar across the 2 treatment \n\ngroups. \n\n \n\nThe primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with \n\nrituximab to rituximab plus placebo in subjects with relapsed/refractory FL Grade 1, 2 or 3a or MZL. \n\nEfficacy determination was based upon PFS as the primary endpoint, as assessed by the IRC using the \n\n2007 International Working Group (IWG) criteria but without positron emission tomography (PET).  \n\n \n\nThe secondary objectives of the study were to compare the safety of lenalidomide in combination with \n\nrituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. Further secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of \n\nrituximab plus lenalidomide versus rituximab plus placebo using the following other parameters of \n\nefficacy: \n\nOverall response rate (ORR), CR rate, and duration of response (DoR) by IWG 2007 without PET and \n\nOS. \n\n \n\nResults from the overall population including FL and MZL showed that at a median follow up of \n\n28.3°months, the study met its primary endpoint of PFS with a hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence \n\ninterval [CI]) of 0.45 (0.33,0.61) p-value < 0.0001.

Subjects who achieved CR/CRu, PR, or SD by \n\nthe end of the induction treatment period were randomised to enter the maintenance treatment period. \n\nAll enrolled subjects must have previously been treated with at least one prior systemic antilymphoma \n\ntherapy. In contrast to study NHL-007, the NHL-008 study included patients who were refractory to \n\nrituximab (no response or relapsed within 6 months of rituximab treatment or who were double-\n\nrefractory to rituximab and chemotherapy). \n\n \n\nDuring the induction treatment period, lenalidomide 20 mg was given on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-\n\nday cycles for up to 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent or disease \n\nprogression. The dose of rituximab was 375 mg/m2 every week in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and \n\non Day 1 of every other 28-day cycle (cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) up to 12 cycles therapy. All dosage \n\ncalculations for rituximab were based on the patient body surface area (BSA) and actual weight. \n\n \n\nThe data presented are based on an interim analysis focusing on the single-arm induction treatment \n\nperiod.. Efficacy determinations are based on ORR by best response as the primary endpoint, using a \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nmodification of the 1999 International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC).

Percentage is based on the total number \nof responders. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted a product-specific waiver for Lenalidomide \n\nAccord that applies to all subsets of the paediatric population for mature B-cell neoplasm conditions., \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nLenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can therefore exist as the optically active forms S(-) \n\nand R(+). Lenalidomide is produced as a racemic mixture. Lenalidomide is generally more soluble in \n\norganic solvents but exhibits the greatest solubility in 0.1N HCl buffer. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nLenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration in healthy volunteers, under fasting \n\nconditions, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.5 and 2 hours post-dose. In \n\npatients, as well as in healthy volunteers, the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area-under-the-\n\nconcentration time curve (AUC) increase proportionally with increases in dose. Multiple dosing does \n\nnot cause marked medicinal product accumulation. In plasma, the relative exposures of the S- and R- \n\nenantiomers of lenalidomide are approximately 56% and 44%, respectively. \n\n \n\nCo-administration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal in healthy volunteers reduces the extent of \n\nabsorption, resulting in an approximately 20% decrease in area under the concentration versus time \n\ncurve (AUC) and 50% decrease in Cmax in plasma. However, in the main multiple myeloma \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nregistration trials where the efficacy and safety were established for lenalidomide, the medicinal \n\nproduct was administered without regard to food intake. Thus, lenalidomide can be administered with \n\nor without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nIn vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins was low with mean plasma protein binding at \n\n23% and 29% in multiple myeloma patients and healthy volunteers, respectively. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is present in human semen (< 0.01% of the dose) after administration of 25 mg/day and \n\nthe medicinal product is undetectable in semen of a healthy subject 3 days after stopping the substance \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nResults from human in vitro metabolism studies indicate that lenalidomide is not metabolised by \n\ncytochrome P450 enzymes suggesting that administration of lenalidomide with medicinal products \n\nthat inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes is not likely to result in metabolic medicinal product \n\ninteractions in humans. In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A, or UGT1A1. Therefore, lenalidomide is unlikely to \n\ncause any clinically relevant medicinal product interactions when co-administered with substrates of \n\nthese enzymes. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide is not a substrate of human breast cancer resistance protein \n\n(BCRP), multidrug resistance protein (MRP) transporters MRP1, MRP2, or MRP3, organic anion \n\ntransporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), \n\norganic cation transporters (OCT) OCT1 and OCT2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) \n\nMATE1, and organic cation transporters novel (OCTN) OCTN1 and OCTN2. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on human bile salt export pump \n\n(BSEP), BCRP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT2. \n\n \n\nA majority of lenalidomide is eliminated through urinary excretion. The contribution of renal \n\nexcretion to total clearance in subjects with normal renal function was 90%, with 4% of lenalidomide \n\neliminated in faeces. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is poorly metabolized as 82% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Hydroxy-\n\nlenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide represent 4.59% and 1.83% of the excreted dose, \n\nrespectively. The renal clearance of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is \n\nat least actively secreted to some extent. \n\n \n\nAt doses of 5 to 25 mg/day, half-life in plasma is approximately 3 hours in healthy volunteers and \n\nranges from 3 to 5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma. \n\n \n\nElderly  \n\nNo dedicated clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in the \n\nelderly. Population pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with ages ranging from 39 to 85 years \n\nold and indicate that age does not influence lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). Because \n\nelderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose \n\nselection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide was studied in subjects with renal impairment due to \n\nnonmalignant conditions. In this study, two methods were used to classify renal function: the urinary \n\ncreatinine clearance measured over 24 hours and the creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft-\n\nGault formula. The results indicate that as renal function decreases (< 50 mL/min), the total \n\nlenalidomide clearance decreases proportionally resulting in an increase in AUC. The AUC was \n\nincreased by approximately 2.5, 4 and 5-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment, severe renal \n\nimpairment, and end-stage renal disease, respectively, compared to the group combining subjects with \n\n\n\n 46 \n\nnormal renal function and subjects with mild renal impairment. The half-life of lenalidomide increased \n\nfrom approximately 3.5 hours in subjects with creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min to more than 9 hours \n\nin subjects with reduced renal function < 50 mL/min. However, renal impairment did not alter the oral \n\nabsorption of lenalidomide. The Cmax was similar between healthy subjects and patients with renal \n\nimpairment. Approximately 30% of the medicinal product in the body was removed during a single 4-\n\nhour dialysis session. Recommended dose adjustments in patients with impaired renal function are \n\ndescribed in section 4.2. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with mild hepatic impairment (N=16, total \n\nbilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN) and indicate that mild hepatic impairment does not \n\ninfluence lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). There are no data available for patients with \n\nmoderate to severe hepatic impairment.  \n\n \n\nOther intrinsic factors  \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that body weight (33- 135 kg), gender, race and type of \n\nhaematological malignancy  do not have a clinically relevant effect on lenalidomide clearance in adult \n\npatients.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nAn embryofoetal development study has been conducted in monkeys administered lenalidomide at \n\ndoses from 0.5 and up to 4 mg/kg/day. Findings from this study indicate that lenalidomide produced \n\nexternal malformations including non-patent anus and malformations of upper and lower extremities \n\n(bent, shortened, malformed, malrotated and/or absent part of the extremities, oligo and/or \n\npolydactyly) in the offspring of female monkeys who received the active substance during pregnancy.  \n\n \n\nVarious visceral effects (discoloration, red foci at different organs, small colourless mass above atrio-\n\nventricular valve, small gall bladder, malformed diaphragm) were also observed in single foetuses. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide has a potential for acute toxicity; minimum lethal doses after oral administration were \n\n> 2000 mg/kg/day in rodents. Repeated oral administration of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day to rats for \n\nup to 26 weeks produced a reversible treatment-related increase in kidney pelvis mineralisation in all \n\n3 doses, most notably in females. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be \n\nless than 75 mg/kg/day, and is approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure based on \n\nAUC exposure. Repeated oral administration of 4 and 6 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 20 weeks \n\nproduced mortality and significant toxicity (marked weight loss, reduced red and white blood cell and \n\nplatelet counts, multiple organ haemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract inflammation, lymphoid, and bone \n\nmarrow atrophy). Repeated oral administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 1 year \n\nproduced reversible changes in bone marrow cellularity, a slight decrease in myeloid/erythroid cell \n\nratio and thymic atrophy. Mild suppression of white blood cell count was observed at 1 mg/kg/day \n\ncorresponding to approximately the same human dose based on AUC comparisons. \n\n \n\nIn vitro (bacterial mutation, human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma, Syrian Hamster Embryo cell \n\ntransformation) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at \n\neither the gene or chromosomal level. Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been \n\nconducted. \n\n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies were previously conducted in rabbits. In these studies, rabbits were \n\nadministered 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day orally. An absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung was \n\nobserved at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day with dose dependence and displaced kidneys were observed at \n\n20 mg/kg/day. Although it was observed at maternotoxic levels they may be attributable to a direct \n\neffect. Soft tissue and skeletal variations in the foetuses were also observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Lenalidomide Accord is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat Lenalidomide Accord is  \n\nLenalidomide Accord  contains the active substance ‘lenalidomide’. This medicine belongs to a group \n\nof medicines which affect how your immune system works. \n\n \n\nWhat Lenalidomide Accord is used for \nLenalidomide Accord is used in adults for multiple myeloma and follicular lymphoma. \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma \n\nMultiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain kind of white blood cell, called the \n\nplasma cell. These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide, becoming out of control. This can \n\ndamage the bones and kidneys.  \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms can be greatly \n\nreduced or disappear for a period of time. This is called a ‘response’. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who have had a bone marrow transplant \n\nLenalidomide Accord is used on its own as maintenance therapy after patients have recovered enough \n\nfollowing a bone marrow transplant. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who cannot have a bone marrow transplant \n\nLenalidomide Accord is taken with other medicines: These may include: \n\n\n\n 81 \n\n a chemotherapy medicine called ‘bortezomib’ \n an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’ \n\n a chemotherapy medicine called ‘melphalan’ and \n\n an immunosuppressant medicine called ‘prednisone’.  \nYou will take these other medicines at the start of treatment and then continue to take lenalidomide  on \n\nits own. \n\n \n\nIf you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check \n\nyou carefully before starting treatment. \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma – in patients who have had treatment before \n\nLenalidomide Accord is taken together with an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’.  \n\n \n\nLenalidomide can stop the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma getting worse. It has also been \n\nshown to delay multiple myeloma from coming back following treatment.  \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma (FL) \n\nFL is a slow growing cancer that affects the B-lymphocytes. These are a type of white blood cells that \n\nhelp your body fight infection. When you have FL, too many of these B-lymphocytes may collect in \n\nyour blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is taken together with another medicine called ‘rituximab’ for the treatment of adult \n\npatients with previously treated follicular lymphoma. \n\n \n\nHow Lenalidomide Accord works \n\nLenalidomide works by affecting the body’s immune system and directly attacking the cancer. It \n\nworks in a number of different ways: \n\n by stopping the cancer cells developing \n\n by stopping blood vessels growing in the cancer \n\n by stimulating part of the immune system to attack the cancer cells. \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Lenalidomide Accord  \n\nYou must read the package leaflet of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with \n\nLenalidomide Accord before starting treament with Lenalidomide Accord. \n\n \n\nDo not take Lenalidomide Accord : \n\n if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, as \nlenalidomide  is expected to be harmful to an unborn child (see section 2, ‘Pregnancy, breast-\n\nfeeding and contraception – information for women and men’). \n\n if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow all the necessary measures to prevent you \nfrom becoming pregnant (see section 2, ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception – \n\ninformation for women and men’). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record \n\nwith each prescription that the necessary measures have been taken and provide you with this \n\nconfirmation. \n\n if you are allergic to lenalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in \nsection 6. If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, do not take lenalidomide. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking lenalidomide   \n\n if you have had blood clots in the past - you have an increased risk of developing blood clots in \nthe veins and arteries during treatment \n\n if you have any signs of an infection, such as a cough or fever  \n\n\n\n 82 \n\n if you have or have ever had previous viral infection, particularly hepatitis B infection, varicella \nzona, HIV. If you are in doubt, talk to your doctor. Treatment with lenalidomide may cause virus \n\nto become active again, in patients who carry the virus, resulting in a recurrence of the infection. \nYour doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection \n\n if you have kidney problems - your doctor may adjust your dose of lenalidomide if you have had a \nheart attack, have ever had a blood clot, or if you smoke, have high blood pressure or raised \n\ncholesterol levels \n\n if you have had an allergic reaction whilst taking thalidomide (another medicine used to treat \nmultiple myeloma) such as rash, itching, swelling, dizziness or difficulty breathing \n\n you have experienced in the past a combination of any of the following symptoms: widespread \nrash, red skin, high body temperature, flu-like symptoms, liver enzyme elevations, blood \n\nabnormalities (eosinophilia), enlarged lymph nodes – these are signs of a severe skin reaction \n\ncalled Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms which is also known as DRESS \n\nor drug hypersensitivity syndrome. (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before starting treatment. \n\n \n\nAt any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you:  \nexperience blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change \n\nin the way you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss \n\nof sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal \n\nbrain condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these \n\nsymptoms prior to treatment with lenalidomide, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. \n\n \n\nTests and checks \nBefore and during the treatment with lenalidomide you will have regular blood tests as it may cause a \n\nfall in the blood cells that help fight infection (white blood cells) and help the blood to clot (platelets).  \n\nYour doctor will ask you to have a blood test: \n\n before treatment  \n\n every week for the first 8 weeks of treatment \n\n then at least every month after that. \n \n\nFor patients with FL taking lenalidomide \n\nYour doctor will ask you to have a blood test: \n\n before treatment  \n\n every week for the first 3 weeks (1 cycle) of treatment \n\n then every 2 weeks in cycles 2 to 4 (see Section 3 ‘Treatment cycle’ for more information) \n\n After this it will happen at the start of each cycle and \n\n at least every month. \n \n\nYour doctor may check if you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your \n\nbone marrow. This could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels \n\nof chemicals in the blood which can lead to kidney failure (this condition is called ‘Tumour Lysis \n\nSyndrome’).  \n\n \n\nYour doctor may check you for changes to your skin such as red spots or rashes. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may adjust your dose of lenalidomide or stop your treatment based on the results of your \n\nblood tests and on your general condition. If you are newly diagnosed, your doctor may also assess \n\nyour treatment based on your age and other conditions you already have. \n\n \n\nBlood donation \n\nYou should not donate blood during treatment and for at least 7 days after the end of treatment. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nLenalidomide is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years.  \n\n\n\n 83 \n\n \n\nElderly and people with kidney problems \n\nIf you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check \n\nyou carefully before starting treatment. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Lenalidomide Accord \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking ,have recently taken or might take  any other medicines. \n\nThis is because lenalidomide  can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other \n\nmedicines can affect the way lenalidomide works.  \n\n \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n some medicines used to prevent pregnancy such as oral contraceptives, as they may stop working \n\n some medicines used for heart problems – such as digoxin \n\n some medicines used to thin the blood – such as warfarin \n\n some medicines used to treat raised cholesterol - such as statins \n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception - information for women and men \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nFor women taking  lenalidomide  \n\n You must not take lenalidomide  if you are pregnant, as it is expected to be harmful to an unborn \nbaby.  \n\n You must not become pregnant while taking lenalidomide.
