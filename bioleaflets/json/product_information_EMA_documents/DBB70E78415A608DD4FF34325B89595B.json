NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEXUBERA 1 mg inhalation powder pre-dispensed. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach unit dose blister contains 1 mg insulin human.  \n \nThe exposure of human insulin following administration of three 1 mg blisters is significantly greater \nthan that following a single 3 mg blister.  Therefore, the 3 mg blister is not interchangeable with three \n1 mg blisters (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nProduced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed. \n \nWhite powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEXUBERA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not \nadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin therapy.  \n \nEXUBERA is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in \naddition to long or intermediate acting subcutaneous insulin, for whom the potential benefits of \nadding inhaled insulin outweigh the potential safety concerns (see section 4.4).   \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEXUBERA (inhaled human insulin) is a fast-acting human insulin for use in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. \nInhaled human insulin may be used alone or in combination with oral antidiabetic agents and/or long \nor intermediate acting subcutaneously administered insulins to optimise glycaemic control. \n \nEXUBERA is available in 1 mg and 3 mg unit dose blisters which are for administration via the lungs \nby oral inhalation only with the insulin inhaler. \n \nConsecutive inhalation of three 1 mg unit dose blisters causes a significantly higher insulin exposure \nthan inhalation of one 3 mg unit dose blister. Therefore three 1 mg unit dose blisters should not be \nsubstituted for one 3 mg unit dose blister (see sections 2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nInhaled human insulin has a faster onset of activity than subcutaneously administered fast-acting \nhuman insulin. Due to the rapid onset of activity, inhaled human insulin should be given within 10 \nminutes before the start of a meal. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\nThe starting and subsequent dosage (dose and timings) should be determined individually by the \nphysician and adjusted according to the patient’s individual response and requirements (e.g. diet, \nphysical activity and life-style). \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \n \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dosage. However, a recommended starting daily dose is based on \nthe following formula: \n \nBody weight (kg) X 0.15 mg/kg = Total Daily Dose (mg).  The total daily dose should be divided into \nthree pre-meal doses. \n \nApproximate guidelines for initial, pre-meal EXUBERA doses, based on patient body weight, are \nindicated in Table 1: \n \n\nPatient Weight \nInitial Dose per \n\nMeal \nApproximate \n\nIU Dose \nNumber of 1 mg \nBlisters per Dose \n\nNumber of 3 mg \nBlisters per Dose \n\n30 to 39.9 kg 1 mg per meal 3 IU 1 - \n40 to 59.9 kg 2 mg per meal 6 IU 2 - \n60 to 79.9 kg 3 mg per meal 8 IU - 1 \n80 to 99.9 kg 4 mg per meal 11 IU 1 1 \n\n100 to 119.9 kg 5 mg per meal 14 IU 2 1 \n120 to 139.9 kg 6 mg per meal 16 IU - 2 \n\n \nTable 1: Approximate Guidelines for Initial, Pre-Meal EXUBERA Dose (based on patient \nbody weight). \n \nA 1 mg blister of inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 3 IU of subcutaneously injected fast-\nacting human insulin. A 3 mg blister of inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 8 IU of \nsubcutaneously injected fast-acting human insulin. Table 1 above presents the approximate IU dose of \nfast-acting human insulin for initial, pre-meal EXUBERA doses in mg. \n \nTherefore, EXUBERA should be used with caution in patients of low body weight. The use of \nEXUBERA in patients requiring dose titrations of less than 1 mg is not recommended (see section \n4.4). \n \nDose adjustment may be required based on the meal size and nutrient composition, time of day \n(higher insulin requirements in the morning), pre-meal blood glucose concentration, recent or \nanticipated exercise. \n \nDuring intercurrent respiratory illness (e.g. bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infections) close \nmonitoring of blood glucose concentrations and dose adjustment may be required on an individual \nbasis (see section 4.4). \n \nFor further details on how to use the insulin inhaler refer to the instructions for use (IFU). \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \n \nIn patients with hepatic or renal impairment insulin requirements may be diminished. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nLong-term safety of inhaled human insulin has not been established in paediatric patients with \ndiabetes and its use is therefore not recommended in patients under 18 years of age (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n4 \n\nElderly \n \nExperience with inhaled insulin in patients � 75 years of age is limited. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nExperience with inhaled insulin in patients with congestive heart failure is very limited and its use is \ntherefore not recommended in such patients where lung function is significantly compromised. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nHypoglycaemia. \n \nPatients must not smoke during therapy with EXUBERA and must have stopped smoking at least 6 \nmonths prior to starting EXUBERA therapy.  If a patient starts or resumes smoking, EXUBERA must \nbe discontinued immediately due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia and an alternative treatment \nutilised (see section 5.2). \n \nPoorly controlled, unstable, or severe asthma. \n \nSevere (GOLD stage III or IV) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients started on EXUBERA must receive comprehensive instructions in the use of the inhaler (see \nIFU). Patients should inhale the insulin powder from the mouthpiece in one slow and steady \ninhalation. Patients should then hold their breath for 5 seconds and exhale normally. A consistent and \nstandard inhalation technique should be employed to ensure both optimal and consistent drug \ndelivery. \n \nPatients should avoid exposing the product to high moisture or relative humidity conditions e.g. a \nsteamy bathroom, when taking their dose. \n \nIf the insulin inhaler is inadvertently exposed to extremely moist conditions during use this usually \nleads to a subsequent decreased insulin dose delivered from the inhaler. In this case, the Insulin \nRelease Unit (IRU) must be changed prior to the next inhalation (see section 6.6). \n \nDosing \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision as this may result in a change in dosage. \n \nConsecutive inhalation of three 1 mg unit dose blisters causes a significantly higher insulin exposure \nthan inhalation of one 3 mg unit dose blister. Therefore three 1 mg unit dose blisters should not be \nsubstituted for one 3 mg unit dose blister (see sections 2, 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nIf the 3 mg blister is temporarily unavailable, two 1 mg blisters should be substituted and blood \nglucose monitored closely. \n \nA 1 mg blister of inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 3 IU of subcutaneously injected fast-\nacting human insulin. Therefore, EXUBERA should be used with caution in patients of low body \nweight. The use of EXUBERA in patients requiring dose titrations of less than 1 mg is not \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\nHypoglycaemia \n \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy including \nEXUBERA and many oral antidiabetic agents, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to \nthe insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to \nneurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life threatening. \n \nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, \nfatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in \nconcentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. \nSevere hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary \nor permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \n \nHypoglycaemia can generally be corrected by immediate carbohydrate intake. In order to be able to \ntake action immediately, patients should carry glucose with them at all times. \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. \n \nUsual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source \ninsulin to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less \npronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the doctor, \nsince this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times. \n \nInadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment especially in insulin-dependant diabetics, may lead \nto hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. \n \nWhen used with other antidiabetic agents, the dose of each agent should be carefully adjusted to \ndetermine the optimal dose required to achieve the desired pharmacological effect. \n \nInsulin requirements may be altered during intercurrent conditions such as illness, emotional \ndisturbances, or stress. \n \nPulmonary Safety \n \nUnderlying respiratory disorders \n \nEXUBERA should not be used in patients with lung disease such as asthma and COPD, as there are \ninsufficient data to support the safe use in these patients. \n \nThe concomitant use of bronchodilators such as salbutamol may increase the absorption of \nEXUBERA and may therefore increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when used to relieve acute \nrespiratory symptoms (see section 4.5). \n \nRespiratory \n \nBronchospasm may rarely occur. Any patients experiencing such a reaction should discontinue \nEXUBERA and seek medical evaluation immediately. Re-administration of EXUBERA requires a \ncareful risk evaluation, and may only be done under close medical monitoring with appropriate \nclinical facilities. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n6 \n\nDecline in pulmonary function \n \nIn clinical trials small but consistent treatment group differences in decline of pulmonary function \n(particularly Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1)) favouring comparator treated subjects \nhave been observed. In clinical studies of up to two years duration, there was no accelerated decline \nbeyond 3-6 months. These small treatment group differences resolved within 6 weeks upon \ndiscontinuation after 2 years of treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nAll patients initiated on EXUBERA should have a baseline lung function examination (e.g. \nspirometry to measure FEV1). The efficacy and safety of inhaled human insulin in patients with \nbaseline FEV1 < 70% predicted have not been established and the use of inhaled human insulin in this \npopulation is not recommended. A follow-up lung function measurement is recommended after the \nfirst 6 months of therapy. If at 6 months a decline of < 15% FEV1 is observed, spirometry should be \nrepeated at one year and then annually. If at 6 months a decline of 15-20% or > 500ml from baseline \nlung function is observed, spirometry should be repeated after 3 months. \n \nIn patients with a confirmed (i.e. at least two consecutive tests, 3 to 4 weeks apart) FEV1  decline of  \n> 20% from baseline, EXUBERA therapy should be discontinued and the patient monitored as \nclinically indicated. There is no experience with the reinstitution of EXUBERA therapy in patients \nwhose lung function recovers. \n \nPatients developing dyspnoea while treated with EXUBERA should be examined for pulmonary or \ncardiac causes. Where pulmonary oedema is present, or there is a clinically relevant reduction in \npulmonary function, EXUBERA should be discontinued and the patient switched to injectable insulin. \n \nIntercurrent Respiratory Illness \n \nEXUBERA has been administered to patients with intercurrent respiratory illness (e.g. bronchitis, \nupper respiratory tract infections) during clinical trials. Increased risk of hypoglycaemia or poor \nglycaemic control has not been observed in these trials. During intercurrent respiratory illness close \nmonitoring of blood glucose concentrations and dose adjustment may be required on an individual \nbasis (see section 4.2). There is no experience with EXUBERA in patients with pneumonia. \n \nFormer Smokers \n \nIn clinical trials of Exubera, there have been 6 newly diagnosed cases of primary lung malignancies \namong Exubera-treated patients, and 1 newly diagnosed case among comparator treated patients. \nThere has also been 1 post-marketing report of a primary lung malignancy in an Exubera-treated \npatient. In controlled clinical trials of Exubera, the incidence of new primary lung cancer per 100 \npatient-years of study drug exposure was 0.130 (5 cases over 3800 patient-years) for Exubera-treated \npatients and 0.03 (1 case over 3900 patient-years) for comparator-treated patients. There were too few \ncases to determine whether the emergence of these events is related to Exubera. All patients who were \ndiagnosed with lung cancer had a prior history of cigarette smoking. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, \nmonoamino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, non-selective beta-blocking agents, salicylates and \nsulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nAdministration of salbutamol prior to EXUBERA may result in increased insulin absorption (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n7 \n\nAdministration of fluticasone prior to EXUBERA does not appear to affect insulin absorption (see \nsection 5.2). \n  \nActive smoking greatly enhances whereas passive exposure to tobacco smoke in non-smokers \ndecreases the rate and extent of absorption of EXUBERA (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, oral \ncontraceptives, thyroid hormones, growth hormone, sympathomimetic agents and thiazides. \nOctreotide/lanreotide may both decrease or increase insulin requirements. \n \nBeta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Alcohol may intensify and prolong \nthe hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \nAdministration of EXUBERA 10 minutes prior to administration of salbutamol did not affect the \nbronchodilatory response to salbutamol in non-diabetic subjects with mild-moderate asthma.   \n \nOther drugs that may alter pulmonary absorption or lung permeability have not been studied. Close \nmonitoring of blood glucose concentrations and dose titration as appropriate are recommended when \ninhaled human insulin is used in these patients. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of \nEXUBERA and such drugs. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere is no clinical experience with EXUBERA use in pregnancy. Inhaled insulin frequently induces \ninsulin antibodies, the risk of which to the foetus is not known. Therefore, EXUBERA should not be \nused during pregnancy.  When an EXUBERA treated patient becomes pregnant appropriate \nsubcutaneous insulin should be substituted for inhaled insulin. \n \nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAs with other insulins, the patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of \nhypoglycaemia. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance \n(e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of EXUBERA alone, or in combination with subcutaneous insulin or oral agents has been \nevaluated in clinical studies of more than 2700 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, including more \nthan 1975 adults exposed for greater than 6 months and more than 745 adults for greater than 2 years. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n8 \n\nThe table below contains adverse reactions seen in controlled clinical studies including more than \n1970 patients exposed to EXUBERA. \n \n\nBody System Very Common \n(� 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(� 1/100, < 1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(� 1/1000, < 1/100) \n\nInfections and \nInfestations \n\n  Pharyngitis \n\nMetabolism and \nNutritional \nDisorders \n\nHypoglycaemia   \n\nRespiratory, \nThoracic and \nMediastinal \nDisorders \n\nCough Dyspnoea \nProductive Cough \nThroat Irritation \n\n Dry Throat  \n\nEpistaxis \nBronchospasm \n\nWheezing \nDysphonia \n\nPharyngolaryngeal \nPain \n\nTonsillar Disorder \nGastrointestinal \n\nDisorders \n  Dry Mouth \n\nGeneral \nDisorders and \nAdministration \nSite Conditions \n\n  Chest Pain \n\n \nNote: In the overall clinical program, including uncontrolled extension studies, there were two \nreports of pleural effusion in which a treatment-related effect could not be excluded. \n\n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nAs with other insulins, hypoglycaemia was the most frequently observed undesirable effect in patients \ntreated with EXUBERA. \n \nCough \n \nThe cough tended to occur within seconds to minutes after insulin inhalation and was predominantly \nmild in severity. This cough decreased over time. One percent of patients discontinued EXUBERA \ntreatment due to cough. \n \nDyspnoea \n \nThe majority (> 95%) of dyspnoea was reported as mild to moderate. In EXUBERA treated subjects \n0.4% discontinued treatment due to dyspnoea.  \n \nChest pain \n \nA range of different chest symptoms were reported as treatment-related adverse reactions and were \nreferred to as non-specific chest pain. The majority (> 95%) of these events was reported as mild to \nmoderate. One subject in the EXUBERA and one in the comparator group discontinued treatment due \nto chest pain. Importantly, the incidence of all-causality adverse events related to coronary artery \ndisease, such as angina pectoris or myocardial infarction was not increased with the use of \nEXUBERA.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n9 \n\nOther reactions \n \nFEV1 decline \n \nSmall treatment group differences in decline of FEV1 were observed in the EXUBERA group relative \nto comparator therapy. In clinical studies of up to two years duration, there was no accelerated decline \nbeyond 3-6 months. Discontinuation of EXUBERA therapy after 2 years resulted in resolution of \ntreatment group differences within 6 weeks (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nA decline from baseline in FEV1 of > 15% occurred in 1.3% of EXUBERA-treated type 1 subjects \nand in 5.0% of EXUBERA-treated type 2 subjects. \n \nInsulin antibodies \n \nInsulin antibodies may develop during treatment with all insulins including EXUBERA. In clinical \ntrials, insulin antibodies developed more frequently and mean levels of insulin antibodies were higher \nin patients who switched their subcutaneous human insulin to EXUBERA compared to subjects who \nremained on subcutaneous human insulin. Insulin antibody levels were higher in patients with type 1 \ndiabetes compared to type 2 diabetes and plateaued within 6-12 months of exposure in both groups. \nNo clinical significance of these antibodies has been identified. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nAs with other insulins, generalised allergic reactions may occur very rarely. Such reactions to insulin \nor the excipients may, for example, be associated with generalised skin reactions, angio-oedema, \nbronchospasm, hypotension and shock and may be life-threatening (see section 4.4 Respiratory). \n \nOedema and refraction abnormalities of the eye  \n \nInsulin therapy may cause sodium retention and oedema. Refraction abnormalities of the eye may \noccur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These effects are usually transitory. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin relative to food intake, energy \nexpenditure or both. \n \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia usually can be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in drug \ndosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes, with coma, seizure, or neurological impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) or concentrated intravenous glucose. Glucose \nmust also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes.  \n \nUpon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in \norder to prevent relapse. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products used in diabetes, ATC code: A10AF01 \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n10 \n\nMode of Action \n \nHuman insulin lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic \neffects, increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the \nmuscles and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and \ngluconeogenesis, increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis. It also \npromotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis and enhances the uptake \nof potassium into cells. \n \nInhaled human insulin, like fast-acting insulin analogues, has a more rapid onset of glucose lowering \nactivity compared to subcutaneously administered soluble human insulin. Inhaled human insulin has a \nduration of glucose lowering activity comparable to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human \ninsulin and longer than fast-acting insulin analogues (see Figure 1). \n \n \n\n \nFigure 1. Mean Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) Normalised to GIRmax for Each Subject Treatment \nVersus Time in Healthy Volunteers. \n \nWhen human insulin is inhaled, the onset of glucose lowering activity is within 10-20 minutes, the \nmaximum effect is exerted approximately 2 hours after inhalation. The duration of action lasts \napproximately 6 hours. \n \nIn subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, inhaled human insulin has a faster onset of glucose \nlowering effect in the early hours after dosing when compared with subcutaneously administered fast-\nacting human insulin. \n \nThe intra-subject variability of glucose lowering activity of inhaled human insulin was generally \ncomparable to that of subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin in subjects with type 1 \nand 2 diabetes mellitus. \n \nUse of inhaled human insulin is associated with an increase in frequency, and levels of insulin \nantibodies. In a prospective exploratory 6 month study in subjects with type 1 diabetes, alterations in \nthe glucose pharmacodynamics with inhaled human insulin were not observed. \n \nInformation on Clinical Trials \n \nControlled clinical trials in type 1 or type 2 diabetes have shown that EXUBERA achieves and \nmaintains effective glycaemic control comparable to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human \ninsulin.  \n \n\n   \n\nM\nea\n\nn \nG\n\nIR\n (%\n\n o\nf M\n\nax\nim\n\num\n)   \n\nTime (min)   \n(\n\nSC Lispro (18 U)   \nExubera (6mg)  \n\n)\nFast-acting \nHuman Insulin \n(18 U) \n\n  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n11 \n\nType 1 Diabetes  \n \nIn clinical trials in type 1 diabetes, patients using a regimen of EXUBERA in combination with long- \nor intermediate-acting insulin had similar reductions in HbA1c compared with patients taking \nsubcutaneous insulin alone. The percentage of patients who achieved a goal of HbA1c < 7.0% was \ncomparable between the treatment groups. \n \nFasting plasma glucose levels were significantly lower in patients treated with regimens including \nEXUBERA compared with those treated with subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin \nonly regimens.  \n \nType 2 Diabetes \n \nPatients in a clinical trial for type 2 diabetes, who used a regimen of EXUBERA in combination with \nlong- or intermediate-acting insulin, had similar changes in HbA1c compared with patients treated \nwith subcutaneous insulin alone.  \nFasting plasma glucose levels were significantly lower in patients treated with EXUBERA regimens \ncompared with those treated with subcutaneous insulin.  \n \nIn clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes not sufficiently controlled with oral agents \nalone, patients using a regimen of EXUBERA alone or in combination with oral agents, had greater \nimprovements in HbA1c compared with patients treated with oral agents alone. In most of these \nstudies the percentages of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0% were higher for patients using a regimen \nincluding EXUBERA compared to patients on oral agents alone. Fasting plasma glucose was similar \nto or lower in patients using a regimen including EXUBERA compared to patients treated with oral \nagents alone. In patients with type 2 diabetes sufficiently controlled with oral agents the glycaemic \ncontrol was not further improved by inhaled insulin. \nFEV1 decline \n \nRandomised, open label parallel group studies were conducted to examine FEV1 changes following \ninitiation of EXUBERA therapy in type 1 and 2 subjects. Both EXUBERA and comparator treated \nsubjects experienced declines in lung function over time during these trials (Figures 2 and 3). Small \ntreatment group differences (favouring comparator) in change from baseline of 0.034L in type 1 and \n0.039L in type 2 occurred after 2 years of therapy. \n \nA decline from baseline in FEV1 of > 15% occurred in 1.3% of EXUBERA-treated and 1.0% of \ncomparator-treated type 1 subjects and in 5.0% of EXUBERA-treated and 3.4% of comparator-treated \ntype 2 subjects. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n12 \n\n \n Figure 2.

Inhaled human insulin is absorbed as \nrapidly as fast-acting insulin analogues and more rapidly than subcutaneously administered fast-acting \nhuman insulin in healthy subjects and in subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (see Figure 4). \n \n \n\nFigure 4: Mean changes in serum free insulin concentrations (µU/mL) after inhalation of 4mg of \nhuman insulin or subcutaneous injection of 12 IU fast-acting human insulin in obese subjects with \ntype 2 diabetes. \n \nThe time to peak insulin concentration (Tmax) is generally half of that for subcutaneously administered \nfast-acting human insulin. Peak insulin concentration is reached generally by 45 minutes for inhaled \nhuman insulin. Intrasubject variability of time to peak insulin concentrations was less for inhaled \nhuman insulin than for subcutaneous fast-acting human insulin in subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes. \n \nIn subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus, inhaled human insulin had a comparable intrasubject \nvariability of AUC to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin. For Cmax, the \nintrasubject variability of inhaled insulin is greater than that of subcutaneously administered fast-\nacting human insulin. In obese subjects with type 2 diabetes, intrasubject variability was comparable \nto or less than that of subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin for Cmax and AUC. \n \nThe relative bioavailability of EXUBERA compared to subcutaneous fast-acting human insulin is \napproximately 10%. Unlike subcutaneous insulin preparations, the bioavailability of EXUBERA is \nnot influenced by Body Mass Index. \n \nIn a study in healthy subjects, systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of inhaled human insulin \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360\n\nT im e (m in )\n\nC\nh\n\nan\nge\n\n F\nro\n\nm\n B\n\nas\nel\n\nin\ne \n\nS\ner\n\num\n F\n\nre\ne \n\nIn\nsu\n\nlin\n \n\nC\non\n\nce\nn\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(u\nU\n\n/m\nl) Inha led Insulin\n\nSubcutaneo us Insulin\n\nEXUBERA (4mg) \n\nFast-acting Human Insulin (12 IU) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n14 \n\nincreased in an approximately dose proportional fashion from 1 mg to 6 mg when a maximum of two \nblisters from either strength or their combination was administered. In a study where the dosage form \nof three 1 mg blisters was compared with one 3 mg blister, Cmax and AUC of inhaling three 1 mg \nblisters were approximately 30% and 40% greater, respectively, than that of inhaling from one 3 mg \nblister, indicating that three 1 mg blisters are not interchangeable with one 3 mg blister (see sections \n2, 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nAn approximately 40% higher bioavailability of three 1 mg unit dose blisters compared to one 3 mg \nunit dose blister was observed in healthy subjects. An explanation for the differences in \nbioavailability appears to be the different energy to mass ratio between the 1 and 3 mg unit blisters \nsince with less powder in the blister the inhaler is more efficient in breaking up or de-agglomerating \nthe powder leading to a larger proportion of smaller aerodynamic particle sizes for the 1 mg blister \n(see sections 2 and 4.4). \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing oral inhalation of a single dose of human insulin approximately 30% of the total blister \ncontent remains in the blister or device, 20% is deposited in the oropharynx, 10% in the conducting \nairways and 40% reaches the deep lung.   \n \nAnimal studies did not show that inhaled human insulin accumulates in the lung. \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nSmoking \n \nSmoking greatly increases the rate and extent of absorption of inhaled human insulin (Cmax about 3 to \n5 times and AUC about 2 to 3 times higher) and therefore could increase the risk of hypoglycaemia \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.5).  \n \nWhen EXUBERA was administered to healthy volunteers following 2-hours of passive exposure to \ncigarette smoke in a controlled experimental setting, insulin AUC and Cmax were reduced by \napproximately 17 and 30%, respectively (see section 4.5). \n \nRespiratory Diseases (Underlying Lung Disease) \n \nIn non-diabetic subjects with mild to moderate asthma, AUC and Cmax for inhaled human insulin in \nthe absence of treatment with a bronchodilator was slightly less than in subjects without asthma. \n \nIn non-diabetic subjects with COPD, the absorption of inhaled human insulin appeared greater \ncompared with that in subjects without COPD (see section 4.4).   \n \nAdministration of salbutamol 30 minutes prior to EXUBERA in non-diabetic subjects with mild-\nmoderate asthma resulted in an increase in insulin AUC and Cmax of between 25 and 51% compared to \nwhen EXUBERA was administered alone (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).  \n \nAdministration of fluticasone 30 minutes prior to EXUBERA did not affect the pharmacokinetics of \nEXUBERA in non-diabetic subjects with mild-moderate asthma (see section 4.5).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThe effect of renal impairment on the absorption of inhaled human insulin has not been studied (see \nsection 4.2). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n15 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the absorption of inhaled human insulin has not been studied (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nGender \n \nIn subjects with diabetes and in subjects without diabetes, no apparent differences in absorption of \ninhaled human insulin were observed between men and women. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nIn children (6-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years) with type 1 diabetes, inhaled human insulin \nwas absorbed more rapidly than fast-acting human insulin. Bioavailability of inhaled human insulin \nrelative to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin was comparable to that of adult \nsubjects with type 1 diabetes (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \n \nIn older subjects with type 2 diabetes, inhaled human insulin was absorbed more rapidly than \nsubcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin.  Bioavailability of inhaled human insulin \nrelative to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin was comparable to those in younger \nadult subjects with type 2 diabetes. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nInhalation toxicity studies in rats and monkeys for up to 6 months gave no evidence for a special risk \nto the respiratory tract due to insulin inhalation powder. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEXUBERA 3 mg inhalation powder pre-dispensed. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach unit dose blister contains 3 mg insulin human. \n \nThe exposure of human insulin following administration of three 1 mg blisters is significantly greater \nthan that following a single 3 mg blister.  Therefore, the 3 mg blister is not interchangeable with three \n1 mg blisters (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nProduced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed. \n \nWhite powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEXUBERA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not \nadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin therapy.  \n \nEXUBERA is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in \naddition to long or intermediate acting subcutaneous insulin, for whom the potential benefits of \nadding inhaled insulin outweigh the potential safety concerns (see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEXUBERA (inhaled human insulin) is a fast-acting human insulin for use in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. \nInhaled human insulin may be used alone or in combination with oral antidiabetic agents and/or long \nor intermediate acting subcutaneously administered insulins to optimise glycaemic control. \n \nEXUBERA is available in 1 mg and 3 mg unit dose blisters which are for administration via the lungs \nby oral inhalation only with the insulin inhaler. \n \nConsecutive inhalation of three 1 mg unit dose blisters causes a significantly higher insulin exposure \nthan inhalation of one 3 mg unit dose blister. Therefore three 1 mg unit dose blisters should not be \nsubstituted for one 3 mg unit dose blister (see sections 2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nInhaled human insulin has a faster onset of activity than subcutaneously administered fast-acting \nhuman insulin. Due to the rapid onset of activity, inhaled human insulin should be given within 10 \nminutes before the start of a meal. \n \nThe starting and subsequent dosage (dose and timings) should be determined individually by the \nphysician and adjusted according to the patient’s individual response and requirements (e.g. diet, \nphysical activity and life-style). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n19 \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dosage. However, a recommended starting daily dose is based on \nthe following formula: \n \nBody weight (kg) X 0.15 mg/kg = Total Daily Dose (mg).  The total daily dose should be divided into \nthree pre-meal doses. \n \nApproximate guidelines for initial, pre-meal EXUBERA doses, based on patient body weight, are \nindicated in Table 1: \n \n\nPatient Weight \nInitial Dose per \n\nMeal \nApproximate \n\nIU Dose \nNumber of 1 mg \nBlisters per Dose \n\nNumber of 3 mg \nBlisters per Dose \n\n30 to 39.9 kg 1 mg per meal 3 IU 1 - \n40 to 59.9 kg 2 mg per meal 6 IU 2 - \n60 to 79.9 kg 3 mg per meal 8 IU - 1 \n80 to 99.9 kg 4 mg per meal 11 IU 1 1 \n\n100 to 119.9 kg 5 mg per meal 14 IU 2 1 \n120 to 139.9 kg 6 mg per meal 16 IU - 2 \n\n \nTable 1: Approximate Guidelines for Initial, Pre-Meal EXUBERA Dose (based on patient \nbody weight). \n \nA 1 mg blister of inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 3 IU of subcutaneously injected fast-\nacting human insulin. A 3 mg blister of inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 8 IU of \nsubcutaneously injected fast-acting human insulin. Table 1 above presents the approximate IU dose of \nfast-acting human insulin for initial, pre-meal EXUBERA doses in mg. \n \nTherefore, EXUBERA should be used with caution in patients of low body weight. The use of \nEXUBERA in patients requiring dose titrations of less than 1 mg is not recommended (see section \n4.4). \n \nDose adjustment may be required based on the meal size and nutrient composition, time of day \n(higher insulin requirements in the morning), pre-meal blood glucose concentration, recent or \nanticipated exercise. \n \nDuring intercurrent respiratory illness (e.g. bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infections) close \nmonitoring of blood glucose concentrations and dose adjustment may be required on an individual \nbasis (see section 4.4). \n \nFor further details on how to use the insulin inhaler refer to the instructions for use (IFU). \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \n \nIn patients with hepatic or renal impairment insulin requirements may be diminished. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nLong-term safety of inhaled human insulin has not been established in paediatric patients with \ndiabetes and its use is therefore not recommended in patients under 18 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly \n \nExperience with inhaled insulin in patients � 75 years of age is limited. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n20 \n\nCongestive heart failure \n \nExperience with inhaled insulin in patients with congestive heart failure is very limited and its use is \ntherefore not recommended in such patients where lung function is significantly compromised. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \n \nHypoglycaemia. \n \nPatients must not smoke during therapy with EXUBERA and must have stopped smoking at least 6 \nmonths prior to starting EXUBERA therapy.  If a patient starts or resumes smoking, EXUBERA must \nbe discontinued immediately due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia and an alternative treatment \nutilised (see section 5.2). \n \nPoorly controlled, unstable, or severe asthma. \n \nSevere (GOLD stage III or IV) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients started on EXUBERA must receive comprehensive instructions in the use of the inhaler (see \nIFU). Patients should inhale the insulin powder from the mouthpiece in one slow and steady \ninhalation. Patients should then hold their breath for 5 seconds and exhale normally. A consistent and \nstandard inhalation technique should be employed to ensure both optimal and consistent drug \ndelivery. \n \nPatients should avoid exposing the product to high moisture or relative humidity conditions e.g. a \nsteamy bathroom, when taking their dose. \n \nIf the insulin inhaler is inadvertently exposed to extremely moist conditions during use this usually \nleads to a subsequent decreased the insulin dose delivered from the inhaler. In this case, the Insulin \nRelease Unit (IRU) must be changed prior to the next inhalation (see section 6.6). \n \nDosing \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision as this may result in a change in dosage. \n \nConsecutive inhalation of three 1 mg unit dose blisters causes a significantly higher insulin exposure \nthan inhalation of one 3 mg unit dose blister. Therefore three 1 mg unit dose blisters should not be \nsubstituted for one 3 mg unit dose blister (see sections 2, 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nIf the 3 mg blister is temporarily unavailable, two 1 mg blisters should be substituted and blood \nglucose monitored closely. \n \nA 1 mg blister of inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 3 IU of subcutaneously injected fast-\nacting human insulin. Therefore, EXUBERA should be used with caution in patients of low body \nweight. The use of EXUBERA in patients requiring dose titrations of less than 1 mg is not \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy including \nEXUBERA and many oral antidiabetic agents, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n21 \n\nthe insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to \nneurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life threatening. \n \nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, \nfatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in \nconcentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. \nSevere hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary \nor permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \n \nHypoglycaemia can generally be corrected by immediate carbohydrate intake. In order to be able to \ntake action immediately, patients should carry glucose with them at all times. \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. \n \nUsual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source \ninsulin to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less \npronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the doctor, \nsince this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times. \n \nInadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment especially in insulin-dependant diabetics, may lead \nto hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. \n \nWhen used with other antidiabetic agents, the dose of each agent should be carefully adjusted to \ndetermine the optimal dose required to achieve the desired pharmacological effect. \n \nInsulin requirements may be altered during intercurrent conditions such as illness, emotional \ndisturbances, or stress. \n \nPulmonary Safety \n  \nUnderlying respiratory disorders \n \nEXUBERA should not be used in patients with lung disease such as asthma and COPD, as there are \ninsufficient data to support the safe use in these patients. \n \nThe concomitant use of bronchodilators such as salbutamol may increase the absorption of \nEXUBERA and may therefore increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when used to relieve acute \nrespiratory symptoms (see section 4.5). \n \nRespiratory \n \nBronchospasm may rarely occur. Any patients experiencing such a reaction should discontinue \nEXUBERA and seek medical evaluation immediately. Re-administration of EXUBERA requires a \ncareful risk evaluation, and may only be done under close medical monitoring with appropriate \nclinical facilities. \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n22 \n\nDecline in pulmonary function \n \nIn clinical trials small but consistent treatment group differences in decline of pulmonary function \n(particularly Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1)) favouring comparator treated subjects \nhave been observed. In clinical studies of up to two years duration, there was no accelerated decline \nbeyond 3-6 months. These small treatment group differences resolved within 6 weeks upon \ndiscontinuation after 2 years of treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nAll patients initiated on EXUBERA should have a baseline lung function examination (e.g. \nspirometry to measure FEV1). The efficacy and safety of inhaled human insulin in patients with \nbaseline FEV1 < 70% predicted have not been established and the use of inhaled human insulin in this \npopulation is not recommended A follow-up lung function measurement is recommended after the \nfirst 6 months of therapy. If at 6 months a decline of < 15% FEV1 is observed, spirometry should be \nrepeated at one year and then annually. If at 6 months a decline of 15-20% or > 500ml from baseline \nlung function is observed, spirometry should be repeated after 3 months. \n \nIn patients with a confirmed (i.e. at least two consecutive tests, 3 to 4 weeks apart) FEV1  decline of  \n> 20% from baseline, EXUBERA therapy should be discontinued and the patient monitored as \nclinically indicated. There is no experience with the reinstitution of EXUBERA therapy in patients \nwhose lung function recovers. \n \nPatients developing dyspnoea while treated with EXUBERA should be examined for pulmonary or \ncardiac causes. Where pulmonary oedema is present, or there is a clinically relevant reduction in \npulmonary function, EXUBERA should be discontinued and the patient switched to injectable insulin. \n \nIntercurrent Respiratory Illness \n \nEXUBERA has been administered to patients with intercurrent respiratory illness (e.g. bronchitis, \nupper respiratory tract infections) during clinical trials. Increased risk of hypoglycaemia or poor \nglycaemic control has not been observed in these trials. During intercurrent respiratory illness close \nmonitoring of blood glucose concentrations and dose adjustment may be required on an individual \nbasis (see section 4.2). There is no experience with EXUBERA in patients with pneumonia. \n \nFormer Smokers \n \nIn clinical trials of Exubera, there have been 6 newly diagnosed cases of primary lung malignancies \namong Exubera-treated patients, and 1 newly diagnosed case among comparator treated patients. \nThere has also been 1 post-marketing report of a primary lung malignancy in an Exubera-treated \npatient. In controlled clinical trials of Exubera, the incidence of new primary lung cancer per 100 \npatient-years of study drug exposure was 0.130 (5 cases over 3800 patient-years) for Exubera-treated \npatients and 0.03 (1 case over 3900 patient-years) for comparator-treated patients. There were too few \ncases to determine whether the emergence of these events is related to Exubera. All patients who were \ndiagnosed with lung cancer had a prior history of cigarette smoking. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, \nmonoamino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, non-selective beta-blocking agents, salicylates and \nsulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nAdministration of salbutamol prior to EXUBERA may result in increased insulin absorption (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n23 \n\nAdministration of fluticasone prior to EXUBERA does not appear to affect insulin absorption (see \nsection 5.2).   \n \nActive smoking greatly enhances whereas passive exposure to tobacco smoke in non-smokers \ndecreases the rate and extent of absorption of EXUBERA (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, oral \ncontraceptives, thyroid hormones, growth hormone, sympathomimetic agents and thiazides. \nOctreotide/lanreotide may both decrease or increase insulin requirements. \n \nBeta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Alcohol may intensify and prolong \nthe hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \nAdministration of EXUBERA 10 minutes prior to administration of salbutamol did not affect the \nbronchodilatory response to salbutamol in non-diabetic subjects with mild-moderate asthma.  \n \nOther drugs that may alter pulmonary absorption or lung permeability have not been studied. Close \nmonitoring of blood glucose concentrations and dose titration as appropriate are recommended when \ninhaled human insulin is used in these patients. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of \nEXUBERA and such drugs. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere is no clinical experience with EXUBERA use in pregnancy. Inhaled insulin frequently induces \ninsulin antibodies, the risk of which to the foetus is not known. Therefore, EXUBERA should not be \nused during pregnancy.  When an EXUBERA treated patient becomes pregnant appropriate \nsubcutaneous insulin should be substituted for inhaled insulin. \n \nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAs with other insulins, the patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of \nhypoglycaemia. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance \n(e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). \n \n4.8    Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of EXUBERA alone, or in combination with subcutaneous insulin or oral agents has been \nevaluated in clinical studies of more than 2700 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, including more \nthan 1975 adults exposed for greater than 6 months and more than 745 adults for greater than 2 years. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n24 \n\nThe table below contains adverse reactions seen in controlled clinical studies including more than \n1970 patients exposed to EXUBERA. \n \n\nBody System Very Common \n(� 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(� 1/100, < 1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(� 1/1000, < 1/100) \n\nInfections and \nInfestations \n\n  Pharyngitis \n\nMetabolism and \nNutritional \nDisorders \n\nHypoglycaemia   \n\nRespiratory, \nThoracic and \nMediastinal \nDisorders \n\nCough Dyspnoea \nProductive Cough \nThroat Irritation \n\n Dry Throat  \n\nEpistaxis \nBronchospasm \n\nWheezing \nDysphonia \n\nPharyngolaryngeal Pain \nTonsillar Disorder \n\nGastrointestinal \nDisorders \n\n  Dry Mouth \n\nGeneral \nDisorders and \nAdministration \nSite Conditions \n\n  Chest Pain \n\n \nNote: In the overall clinical program, including uncontrolled extension studies, there were two \nreports of pleural effusion in which a treatment-related effect could not be excluded. \n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n \nAs with other insulins, hypoglycaemia was the most frequently observed undesirable effect in patients \ntreated with EXUBERA. \n \nCough \n \nThe cough tended to occur within seconds to minutes after insulin inhalation and was predominantly \nmild in severity. This cough decreased over time. One percent of patients discontinued EXUBERA \ntreatment due to cough. \n \nDyspnoea \n \nThe majority (> 95%) of dyspnoea was reported as mild to moderate. In EXUBERA treated subjects \n0.4% discontinued treatment due to dyspnoea.  \n \nChest pain \n \nA range of different chest symptoms were reported as treatment-related adverse reactions and were \nreferred to as non-specific chest pain.. The majority (> 95%) of these events was reported as mild to \nmoderate. One subject in the EXUBERA and one in the comparator group discontinued treatment due \nto chest pain. Importantly, the incidence of all-causality adverse events related to coronary artery \ndisease, such as angina pectoris or myocardial infarction was not increased with the use of \nEXUBERA.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n25 \n\nOther reactions \n \nFEV1 decline \n \nSmall treatment group differences in decline of FEV1 were observed in the EXUBERA group relative \nto comparator therapy. In clinical studies of up to two years duration, there was no accelerated decline \nbeyond 3-6 months. Discontinuation of EXUBERA therapy after 2 years resulted in resolution of \ntreatment group differences within 6 weeks (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nA decline from baseline in FEV1 of > 15% occurred in 1.3% of EXUBERA-treated type 1 subjects \nand in 5.0% of EXUBERA-treated type 2 subjects. \n \nInsulin antibodies \n \nInsulin antibodies may develop during treatment with all insulins including EXUBERA. In clinical \ntrials, insulin antibodies developed more frequently and mean levels of insulin antibodies were higher \nin patients who switched their subcutaneous human insulin to EXUBERA compared to subjects who \nremained on subcutaneous human insulin. Insulin antibody levels were higher in patients with type 1 \ndiabetes compared to type 2 diabetes and plateaued within 6-12 months of exposure in both groups. \nNo clinical significance of these antibodies has been identified. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nAs with other insulins, generalised allergic reactions may occur very rarely. Such reactions to insulin \nor the excipients may, for example, be associated with generalised skin reactions, angio-oedema, \nbronchospasm, hypotension and shock and may be life-threatening (see section 4.4 Respiratory). \n \nOedema and refraction abnormalities of the eye  \n \nInsulin therapy may cause sodium retention and oedema. Refraction abnormalities of the eye may \noccur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These effects are usually transitory. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin relative to food intake, energy \nexpenditure or both. \n \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia usually can be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in drug \ndosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes, with coma, seizure, or neurological impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) or concentrated intravenous glucose. Glucose \nmust also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes.  \n \nUpon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in \norder to prevent relapse. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products used in diabetes, ATC code: A10AF01 \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n26 \n\nMode of Action \n \nHuman insulin lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic \neffects, increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the \nmuscles and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and \ngluconeogenesis, increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis. It also \npromotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis and enhances the uptake \nof potassium into cells. \n \nInhaled human insulin, like fast-acting insulin analogues, has a more rapid onset of glucose lowering \nactivity compared to subcutaneously administered soluble human insulin. Inhaled human insulin has a \nduration of glucose lowering activity comparable to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human \ninsulin and longer than fast-acting insulin analogues (see Figure 1). \n \n\nFigure 1. Mean Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) Normalised to GIRmax for Each Subject Treatment \nVersus Time in Healthy Volunteers. \n \nWhen human insulin is inhaled, the onset of glucose lowering activity is within 10-20 minutes, the \nmaximum effect is exerted approximately 2 hours after inhalation. The duration of action lasts \napproximately 6 hours. \n \nIn subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, inhaled human insulin has a faster onset of glucose \nlowering effect in the early hours after dosing when compared with subcutaneously administered fast-\nacting human insulin. \n \nThe intra-subject variability of glucose lowering activity of inhaled human insulin was generally \ncomparable to that of subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin in subjects with type 1 \nand 2 diabetes mellitus. \n \nUse of inhaled human insulin is associated with an increase in frequency, and levels of insulin \nantibodies. In a prospective exploratory 6 month study in subjects with type 1 diabetes, alterations in \nthe glucose pharmacodynamics with inhaled human insulin were not observed \n \nInformation on Clinical Trials \n \nControlled clinical trials in type 1 or type 2 diabetes have shown that EXUBERA achieves and \nmaintains effective glycaemic control comparable to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human \ninsulin.  \n \n\n   \n\nM\nea\n\nn \nG\n\nIR\n (%\n\n o\nf M\n\nax\nim\n\num\n)   \n\nTime (min)   \n(\n\nSC Lispro (18 U)   \nExubera (6mg)  \n\n)\nFast-acting \nHuman Insulin \n(18 U) \n\n  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n27 \n\nType 1 Diabetes  \n \nIn clinical trials in type 1 diabetes, patients using a regimen of EXUBERA in combination with long- \nor intermediate-acting insulin had similar reductions in HbA1c compared with patients taking \nsubcutaneous insulin alone. The percentage of patients who achieved a goal of HbA1c < 7.0% was \ncomparable between the treatment groups. \n \nFasting plasma glucose levels were significantly lower in patients treated with regimens including \nEXUBERA compared with those treated with subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin \nonly regimens.  \n \nType 2 Diabetes \n \nPatients in a clinical trial for type 2 diabetes, who used a regimen of EXUBERA in combination with \nlong- or intermediate-acting insulin, had similar changes in HbA1c compared with patients treated \nwith subcutaneous insulin alone.  \n \nFasting plasma glucose levels were significantly lower in patients treated with EXUBERA regimens \ncompared with those treated with subcutaneous insulin.  \n \nIn clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes not sufficiently controlled with oral agents \nalone, patients using a regimen of EXUBERA alone or in combination with oral agents, had greater \nimprovements in HbA1c compared with patients treated with oral agents alone. In most of these \nstudies the percentages of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0% were higher for patients using a regimen \nincluding EXUBERA compared to patients on oral agents alone. Fasting plasma glucose was similar \nto or lower in patients using a regimen including EXUBERA compared to patients treated with oral \nagents alone. In patients with type 2 diabetes sufficiently controlled with oral agents the glycaemic \ncontrol was not further improved by inhaled insulin. \n \nFEV1 decline \n \nRandomised, open label parallel group studies were conducted to examine FEV1 changes following \ninitiation of EXUBERA therapy in type 1 and 2 subjects. Both EXUBERA and comparator treated \nsubjects experienced declines in lung function over time during these trials (Figures 2 and 3). Small \ntreatment group differences (favouring comparator) in change from baseline of 0.034L in type 1 and \n0.039L in type 2 occurred after 2 years of therapy. \n \nA decline from baseline in FEV1 of > 15% occurred in 1.3% of EXUBERA-treated and 1.0% of \ncomparator-treated type 1 subjects and in 5.0% of EXUBERA-treated and 3.4% of comparator-treated \ntype 2 subjects. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n28 \n\n \n Figure 2.

In a smaller group (n=36) of \nmixed type 1 and 2 subjects treated with EXUBERA for > 36 months, cessation of therapy resulted in \na mean FEV1 increase of 0.036L over the subsequent 6 months. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nInhaled human insulin is delivered by the pulmonary route. Inhaled human insulin is absorbed as \nrapidly as fast-acting insulin analogues and more rapidly than subcutaneously administered fast-acting \nhuman insulin in healthy subjects and in subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (see Figure 4). \n \nFigure 4: Mean changes in serum free insulin concentrations (µU/mL) after inhalation of 4mg of \nhuman insulin or subcutaneous injection of 12 IU fast-acting human insulin in obese subjects with \ntype 2 diabetes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe time to peak insulin concentration (Tmax) is generally half of that for subcutaneously administered \nfast-acting human insulin. Peak insulin concentration is reached generally by 45 minutes for inhaled \nhuman insulin. Intrasubject variability of time to peak insulin concentrations was less for inhaled \nhuman insulin than for subcutaneous fast-acting human insulin in subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes. \n \nIn subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus, inhaled human insulin had a comparable intrasubject \nvariability of AUC to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin. For Cmax, the \nintrasubject variability of inhaled insulin is greater than that of subcutaneously administered fast-\nacting human insulin. In obese subjects with type 2 diabetes, intrasubject variability was comparable \nto or less than that of subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin for Cmax and AUC. \n \nThe relative bioavailability of EXUBERA compared to subcutaneous fast-acting human insulin is \napproximately 10%. Unlike subcutaneous insulin preparations, the bioavailability of EXUBERA is \nnot influenced by Body Mass Index. \n \nIn a study in healthy subjects, systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of inhaled human insulin \n\nEXUBERA (4mg) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n30 \n\nincreased in an approximately dose proportional fashion from 1 mg to 6 mg when a maximum of two \nblisters from either strength or their combination was administered. In a study where the dosage form \nof three 1 mg blisters was compared with one 3 mg blister, Cmax and AUC of inhaling three 1 mg \nblisters were approximately 30% and 40% greater, respectively, than that of inhaling from one 3 mg \nblister, indicating that three 1 mg blisters are not interchangeable with one 3 mg blister (see sections \n2, 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nAn approximately 40% higher bioavailability of three 1 mg unit dose blisters compared to one 3 mg \nunit dose blister was observed in healthy subjects. An explanation for the differences in \nbioavailability appears to be the different energy to mass ratio between the 1 and 3 mg unit blisters \nsince with less powder in the blister the inhaler is more efficient in breaking up or de-agglomerating \nthe powder leading to a larger proportion of smaller aerodynamic particle sizes for the 1 mg blister \n(see sections 2 and 4.4). \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing oral inhalation of a single dose of human insulin approximately 30% of the total blister \ncontent remains in the blister or device, 20% is deposited in the oropharynx, 10% in the conducting \nairways and 40% reaches the deep lung.   \n \nAnimal studies did not show that inhaled human insulin accumulates in the lung. \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nSmoking \n \nSmoking greatly increases the rate and extent of absorption of inhaled human insulin (Cmax about 3 to \n5 times and AUC about 2 to 3 times higher) and therefore could increase the risk of hypoglycaemia \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.5).  \n \nWhen EXUBERA was administered to healthy volunteers following 2-hours of passive exposure to \ncigarette smoke in a controlled experimental setting, insulin AUC and Cmax were reduced by \napproximately 17 and 30%, respectively (see section 4.5). \n \nRespiratory Diseases (Underlying Lung Disease) \n \nIn non-diabetic subjects with mild to moderate asthma, AUC and Cmax for inhaled human insulin in \nthe absence of treatment with a bronchodilator was slightly less than in subjects without asthma. \n \nIn non-diabetic subjects with COPD, the absorption of inhaled human insulin appeared greater \ncompared with that in subjects without COPD (see section 4.4).   \n \nAdministration of salbutamol 30 minutes prior to EXUBERA in non-diabetic subjects with mild-\nmoderate asthma resulted in an increase in insulin AUC and Cmax of between 25 and 51% compared to \nwhen EXUBERA was administered alone (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).  \n \nAdministration of fluticasone 30 minutes prior to EXUBERA did not affect the pharmacokinetics of \nEXUBERA in non-diabetic subjects with mild-moderate asthma (see section 4.5).    \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n31 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nThe effect of renal impairment on the absorption of inhaled human insulin has not been studied (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the absorption of inhaled human insulin has not been studied (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nGender \n \nIn subjects with diabetes and in subjects without diabetes, no apparent differences in absorption of \ninhaled human insulin were observed between men and women. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nIn children (6-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years) with type 1 diabetes, inhaled human insulin \nwas absorbed more rapidly than fast-acting human insulin. Bioavailability of inhaled human insulin \nrelative to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin was comparable to that of adult \nsubjects with type 1 diabetes (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \n \nIn older subjects with type 2 diabetes, inhaled human insulin was absorbed more rapidly than \nsubcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin.  Bioavailability of inhaled human insulin \nrelative to subcutaneously administered fast-acting human insulin was comparable to those in younger \nadult subjects with type 2 diabetes. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nInhalation toxicity studies in rats and monkeys for up to 6 months gave no evidence for a special risk \nto the respiratory tract due to insulin inhalation powder. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have further questions, please ask your doctor, diabetes nurse or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1. What EXUBERA is and what it is used for \n2. Before you take EXUBERA \n3. How to take EXUBERA \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store EXUBERA \n6. Further information \n \nTaking three separate 1 mg unit dose blisters delivers more insulin to your lungs than a single 3 mg \nunit dose blister does. Three 1 mg unit dose blisters should not be substituted for one 3mg blister (see \nsection 2, “Take special care with EXUBERA”, section 3, “How to take EXUBERA” and section 6 \n“Further information”). \n \nA unit dose blister is the individual container in which the insulin powder is packaged and will be \ncalled a blister in the rest of this leaflet. \n \n \n1. WHAT EXUBERA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nEXUBERA is an inhalation powder contained in blisters. The contents of the blisters should be \nbreathed in through your mouth into your lungs using the insulin inhaler. \n \nEXUBERA is an anti-diabetic agent that lowers your blood sugar. \n \nEXUBERA is a fast-acting insulin. This means that it will start to lower your blood sugar 10-20 \nminutes after you take it, with a maximum effect at 2 hours and the effect will last for around 6 hours. \n \nEXUBERA is often given in combination with other diabetes treatments.  \n \nEXUBERA is used to reduce high blood sugar in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who \nneed insulin.  \n \nEXUBERA can also be used to treat type 1 diabetes in adults whose level of blood sugar is not well-\ncontrolled by insulin injections.  \n \nDiabetes is a disease in which your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood \nsugar. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n55 \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE EXUBERA \n \nDo not take EXUBERA \n \n• If you feel hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) coming on. See the information at the end of \n\nsection 4 “Possible side effects” of this leaflet for further advice.  \n• If you are allergic to insulin, the active ingredient contained in EXUBERA or any of the other \n\ningredients of EXUBERA. If you suspect an allergy to EXUBERA, speak to your doctor \nimmediately.  \n\n• If you smoke, or if you have smoked in the last six months you must not take EXUBERA as \nyou may have extra risk of hypoglycaemia (very low blood sugar). Please speak to your doctor \nimmediately if you take EXUBERA and resume smoking or have smoked in the last 6 months \nbefore starting to take EXUBERA. \n\n• If you have poorly controlled , unstable, or severe asthma. \n• If you have severe (GOLD stage III or IV), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). \n \nTake special care with EXUBERA \n \nPlease follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor or nurse. \n \nBefore you start taking EXUBERA your doctor or nurse will tell you how to use the inhaler properly. \nPlease also read the “Instructions for Use” of the inhaler at the end of the package leaflet carefully \nbefore taking EXUBERA. Make sure that you can use the inhaler properly as this could affect the \namount of insulin you breathe in.  \n \nYou should avoid taking EXUBERA in moist conditions e.g. a bathroom following a steamy shower \nas this will usually give you a lower insulin dose than you need (see “Instructions for Use” at the end \nof the package leaflet for advice).  \n \nIf you accidentally expose your inhaler to moist conditions during use, this will usually decrease the \ndose of insulin you take. In this case you must change the Insulin Release Unit (IRU) prior to your \nnext inhalation. \n \nDosing \n \nYour doctor will prescribe your starting pre-meal dose of EXUBERA based on your body weight. \nThis may include a mix of 1 mg (green coloured) and 3 mg (blue coloured) blisters.  It is important to \nfollow your doctor’s instructions exactly. \n \nA 1 mg unit dose blister is approximately equal to 3 IU of fast-acting subcutaneous insulin and a 3 mg \nunit dose blister is approximately equal to 8 IU of fast-acting subcutaneous insulin. \n \nDose adjustments may be required based on meal size and nutrient composition, time of day (higher \ninsulin requirements in the morning), pre-meal blood glucose concentration, recent or planned \nexercise. \n \nDo not use three separate 1 mg blisters in place of one 3 mg blister, as this will give you a much \nhigher insulin dose (see “How to take EXUBERA” for further advice). \n \nIf you have low body weight check with your doctor if you can use EXUBERA. If you need dose \ntitrations of less than 1 mg it is recommended you do not use EXUBERA (see section 3 “How to take \nEXUBERA” for further advice and section 6 “Further information”). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n56 \n\nSpecial patient groups \n \nIf your liver or kidneys do not function well speak to your doctor, who may advise that you use lower \ninsulin doses. \nIf you are under 18 years of age, please speak to your doctor, as use of EXUBERA is not \nrecommended for patients under 18 years of age. \n \nThere is little experience with EXUBERA in patients older than 75 years. \n \nThere is very little experience with EXUBERA in patients with congestive heart failure. EXUBERA \nis not recommended if you have breathing difficulties with congestive heart failure. \n \nLung diseases \n \nTalk to your doctor if you have any lung disease such as asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis. \nEXUBERA is not recommended for patients with lung disease. Also, if you experience breathing \ndifficulties that you have not previously discussed with your doctor, you should discuss them before \nstarting EXUBERA treatment.  \n \nBefore starting treatment your doctor will carry out a simple test on your lung function to decide \nwhether EXUBERA is the right treatment for you.  Once you start treatment, your doctor will check \nyour lung function again after 6 months and at other times to see how well you are tolerating \nEXUBERA. \n \nIf you notice an immediate and severe worsening of your breathing soon after taking a dose of \nEXUBERA, you should stop taking EXUBERA and tell your doctor immediately or go to the casualty \ndepartment at your nearest hospital. \n \nYou should also tell your doctor if you develop any other increasing breathing difficulties while \ntaking EXUBERA. \n \nIllness and injuries \n \nIf you are ill or have a major injury, then your blood sugar may increase (hyperglycaemia) or if you \nare not eating enough your blood sugar may become too low (hypoglycaemia). In such situations, the \nmanagement of your diabetes may require a lot of care and you may need to seek advice from your \ndoctor or nurse.  \n \nIf you have infection in your airways (such as bronchitis or upper respiratory tract infection) while \ntaking EXUBERA you should monitor your blood glucose frequently and you may need to adjust \nyour EXUBERA dose. Please talk to your doctor if you have problems administering EXUBERA or \ncontrolling your blood glucose. There is no experience with EXUBERA in patients with infection of \nthe deep lung (pneumonia). \n \nPlease see the end of section 4 for important information about hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia \nand its treatment. \n \nTravel \n \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor or nurse to talk about timings of meals and insulin \nadministration while travelling, the possible effects of changing to different time zones on blood sugar \nlevels and control and the availability of EXUBERA in the countries you are visiting. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n57 \n\nTaking other medicines \n \nSome medicines cause the blood sugar level to fall, some cause it to rise, others may have both \neffects, depending on the situation. In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to \navoid too low or too high blood sugar levels. Be careful not only when you start another medicine, but \nalso when you stop it.  \n \nTell your doctor about all medicines that you are taking, including those you have bought without a \nprescription (such as from a Pharmacy or other shop). Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it \ncan affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar to fall include diabetes tablets, angiotensin converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used for the treatment of certain heart conditions, high blood pressure or \nelevated protein/albumin in the urine), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used \nfor the treatment of depression), certain beta-blockers (used for the treatment of certain heart \nconditions and high blood pressure), salicylates (e.g. aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever) and \nsulphonamide antibiotics.  \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar to rise include corticosteroids (used to treat inflammatory \nconditions, except topical administration), danazol (used for the treatment of some female hormonal \ndisorders), oral contraceptives (used for birth control), thyroid hormones (used for the treatment of \nmalfunction of the thyroid gland), growth hormones (used in endocrine conditions), sympathomimetic \nagents (used for the treatment of asthma) and thiazides (used in special endocrine conditions).  \n \nThe use of a bronchodilator (reliever inhaler) for asthma or other airway conditions may cause a more \npronounced fall in blood sugar in response to inhaled insulin (see section 2 “Do not take EXUBERA” \nand section 2 “Take special care with EXUBERA”). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either fall or rise if you take beta-blockers or drink alcohol.  Beta-\nblockers may weaken the warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemic reaction or suppress them entirely.  \nAlcohol may increase the action of insulin and cause low blood sugar levels. Octreotide/lanreotide \n(used in special endocrine conditions) may change the need for insulin. \n \nIf you smoke, the amount of insulin your body absorbs will be increased and you will have a greater \nrisk of hypoglycaemia.  If you are taking EXUBERA, do not smoke (see section 2, “Do not take \nEXUBERA”). \n \nIn contrast, exposure to other people’s cigarette smoke may decrease the amount of insulin your body \nabsorbs. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nThere is no experience on the use of EXUBERA in pregnant women. EXUBERA should not be taken \nduring pregnancy. Inform your doctor or nurse if you are planning to become pregnant or if you are \nalready pregnant. Your doctor may replace EXUBERA with an injectable insulin for your diabetes. \nYour insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Careful control \nof your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n58 \n\nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if you have too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). \nPlease keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at \nrisk (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability \nof driving if you have: \n- frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia. \n \n \n3. HOW TO TAKE EXUBERA \n \nEXUBERA should be taken within 10 minutes before the start of a meal. \n \nYour doctor will decide how much EXUBERA you will initially need based on your weight and \nrecommend any changes after that based on your diet and amount of exercise. \n \nA 1 mg blister of EXUBERA gives you about the same insulin dose as 3 IU of subcutaneously \ninjected fast-acting insulin human. A 3 mg blister of EXUBERA gives you about the same insulin \ndose as 8 IU of subcutaneously injected fast-acting insulin human. If you have low body weight check \nwith your doctor if you can use EXUBERA. If you need dose titrations of less than 1 mg it is \nrecommended you do not use EXUBERA. \n \nAlways make sure you have the correct strength and number of EXUBERA blisters available before \ntaking your dose. It is important that you take the number of 1 mg and 3 mg blisters that your doctor \nrecommends in the combination that he or she recommends.  \n \nDo not use three 1 mg blisters in place of one 3 mg blister, as this will give you a much higher \ndose of insulin. If you temporarily run out of 3 mg blisters, two 1 mg blisters should be used and \nyou should monitor your blood glucose levels closely. You should contact your doctor or \npharmacist as soon as possible to get more 3 mg blisters.  If you are unsure contact your doctor, \nnurse or pharmacist. \n \nPreparing to take EXUBERA \n \nTo use an EXUBERA blister, first separate the blister from the spine by tearing along the tear line \n(perforation). \n \nDo not open the blister containing EXUBERA.  The blister will be punctured inside the inhaler when \nyou use it.  Do not swallow the contents of the blister. \n \nEXUBERA should only be breathed in through your mouth and should only be taken with your \ninsulin inhaler. \n \nAlways follow your doctor’s instructions about when and how to take EXUBERA. Please see the \n“Instructions for Use” at the end of the package leaflet for advice on how to use your insulin inhaler, \nand how to care for it. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you have any questions \nregarding EXUBERA or the insulin inhaler.  \n \nMistakes in dosage \n \nPlease discuss with your doctor what you should do if you were to take too much or too little \nEXUBERA, or if you miss a dose, so that you know what to do. \n \n–If you have taken too much insulin, you may develop hypoglycaemia. Check your blood sugar \nfrequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n59 \n\nsugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see the end of section 4 “Possible side \neffects”. \n \n–If you have missed a dose of insulin or if you have taken too low a dose, your blood sugar level \nmay become too high. Check your blood sugar frequently. For further information on hyperglycaemia, \nsee the end of section 4 “Possible side effects”. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, EXUBERA can have side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects reported very commonly  \n(Seen in more than 1 in 10 patients) \n \nHypoglycaemia - As with all insulin therapy, the most common side effect with EXUBERA is \nhypoglycaemia (too low blood sugar). Please see the end of this section for important further \ninformation about hypoglycaemia and its treatment. \n \nCough - A cough may occur within seconds to minutes after inhaling EXUBERA. The cough is \nusually mild and often gets better over time. \n \nSide effects reported commonly \n(Seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) \n \nCommonly reported side effects are mild to moderate shortness of breath (dyspnoea), productive \ncough, throat irritation and dry throat. \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly \n(Seen in less than 1 in 100 but more than 1 in 1000 patients). \n \nUncommon side effects are inflammation of the throat (pharyngitis), nose bleed (epistaxis), airway \nconstriction with difficulties breathing (bronchospasm), wheezing, voice alteration (dysphonia), throat \npain (pharyngolaryngeal pain), tonsillar disorder, dry mouth and chest pain. \n \nOther side effects \n \nSome patients have experienced fluid in the lung lining (pleural effusion). \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that bind to insulin).  \nDevelopment of such antibodies is seen more commonly in patients treated with EXUBERA \ncompared to subcutaneous insulin. Although these antibodies may be produced, they do not have any \neffect on your blood glucose control. \n \nA small decrease in your lung function may occur during EXUBERA treatment, although you should \nnot notice any symptoms. This change occurs within the first months of treatment and usually doesn’t \nworsen as you continue treatment. If you stop therapy with EXUBERA, your lung function will \nusually return to your normal level. If you notice a change in your breathing while taking EXUBERA \ninform your doctor. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin are very rare. Such reactions to insulin or to the other ingredients \ncan cause skin reactions, severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angio-oedema), shortness of \nbreath, a fall in blood pressure and may become life threatening. \n \nChanges to your sight may occur upon starting insulin therapy. These changes are usually mild and go \naway with time. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n60 \n\nInsulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves \nand ankles. \n  \nIf any of these side effects get serious or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia) \nYour blood sugar levels may fall too much, if for example: \n– you take too much insulin, \n– you miss meals or delay them, \n– you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances \nsimilar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), \n– you lose or are unable to consume carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n– you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n– you take more physical exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n– you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n– you are recovering from a feverish illness or from another illness, \n– you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, “Taking other \nmedicines”). \n \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels) are also more likely to occur if: \n– you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n– your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n– you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nSymptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast may be, for \nexample: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heartbeat, high blood pressure, palpitations and \nirregular heartbeat, chest pain (angina pectoris). These symptoms often develop before the symptoms \nof a low sugar level in the brain. \n \nThe following symptoms indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (“warning symptoms”) may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if: \n– you are elderly,  \n– you have had diabetes for a long time  \n– due to diabetes, you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (autonomic neuropathy), \n– you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (e.g. the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n– you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n– you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, “Taking other medicines”). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even lose consciousness) before you are \naware of the problem. Try always to keep familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more \nfrequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that might otherwise be \noverlooked. While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations \n(e.g. driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n61 \n\n \nWhat to do in case of hypoglycaemia \n1. Do not take more insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 gram sugar, e.g. as glucose, sugar cubes \nor a sugar-sweetened drink. (Measure once as spoonfuls or lumps of sugar or glucose tablets to see \nhow much this means). Caution: please remember that artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial \nsweeteners (e.g. diet drinks) are of no help in hypoglycaemia. \n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (e.g. bread). Your \ndoctor or nurse will have discussed this with you. \n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 gram sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nAlways carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.  \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections may be justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia) \nYour blood sugar level may be too high, if for example: \n– you have not taken enough insulin, or if it has become less effective, e.g. through incorrect storage, \n– you are doing less physical exercise, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or if you \nhave an injury, operation, feverish illness or certain other diseases, \n– you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, “Taking other medicines”). \n \nSymptoms that may tell you that your blood sugar levels are too high: \nthirst, increased need to pass water, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low \nblood pressure, fast heartbeat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine may be signs of too high blood \nsugar. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs \nof a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin. \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any such symptoms of \nhyperglycaemia occur as described above. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be \ntreated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. \n \nCarry some information with you to show you are diabetic. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE EXUBERA \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nStore below 30°C. Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture. \n \nAfter opening the foil overwrap: store below 25oC and use within 3 months of opening.  \nDo not refrigerate or freeze the blisters. \n \nDo not use EXUBERA if you notice that a blister is not properly sealed or damaged. \n \nDo not use EXUBERA after the expiry date (EXP) stated on the pack or unit dose blisters. \n \nFor instructions on how to look after your insulin inhaler see “Instructions for Use” at the end of the \npackage leaflet. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n62 \n\n6. FURTHER INFORMATION \n \nWhat EXUBERA contains \n \n- The active substance is insulin human. Each unit dose blister contains 1 mg or 3 mg of the \n\nactive substance insulin human. \n- The other ingredients are: mannitol, glycine, sodium citrate (as dihydrate) and sodium \n\nhydroxide. \n \nTaking three separate 1 mg blisters delivers more insulin to your lungs than a single 3 mg blister does. \nThree 1 mg blisters should not be substituted for one 3 mg blister (see section 2, “Take special care \nwith EXUBERA” and section 3, “How to take EXUBERA”). \n \nWhat EXUBERA looks like and contents of the pack \n \nEXUBERA is an inhalation powder, pre-dispensed, and is supplied as tear-off unit dose blisters \nmarked with either ‘1 mg EXUBERA’ with green ink or ‘3 mg EXUBERA’ with blue ink. For the \n1 mg product, the spine of the blister card has one raised ridge with the individual blisters embossed \nwith one raised dot each. For the 3 mg product, the spine of the blister card has three raised ridges \nwith the individual blisters embossed with three raised dots each. There are 6 blisters on each card \nand 5 cards per tray. The tray is sealed in a plastic foil pouch with a desiccant, which keeps the \nmedicine dry and should not be eaten. \n \nEXUBERA is available in the following pack sizes: \n \n• A pack containing 30, 60, 90, 180 and 270 x 1 of 1 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose \n\nblisters  \n \n• A pack containing 30, 60, 90, 180 and 270 x 1 of 3 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose \n\nblisters \n \n• A pack containing 60 x 1 of 1 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters (2 pouches) \n\nand 2 spare Insulin Release Units (IRU) \n \n• A pack containing 270 x 1 of 1 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters (9 pouches) \n\nand 6 spare Insulin Release Units (IRU) \n \n• A pack containing 60 x 1 of 3 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters (2 pouches) \n\nand 2 spare Insulin Release Units (IRU) \n \n• A pack containing 90 x 1 of 3 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters (3 pouches) \n\nand 2 spare Insulin Release Units (IRU) \n \n• A pack containing 180 x 1 of 3 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters (6 pouches) \n\nand 2 spare Insulin Release Units (IRU) \n \n• A pack containing 270 x 1 of 3 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters (9 pouches) \n\nand 6 spare Insulin Release Units (IRU) \n \n• A kit containing 90 x 1 of 1 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters (3 pouches), 1 \n\ninsulin inhaler, 1 spare chamber and 6 spare Insulin Release Units (IRU) \n \n• A kit containing 90 x 1 of 3 mg PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters (3 pouches), 1 \n\ninsulin inhaler, 1 spare chamber and 6 spare Insulin Release Units (IRU) \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n63 \n\nAdditional insulin inhaler, insulin release units and chamber packages are available. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nThe marketing authorisation holder is Pfizer Limited, Ramsgate Road, Sandwich, Kent CT13 9NJ, \nUnited Kingdom. \n \nThe manufacturer is Heinrich Mack Nachf.

You \nwill see a blue line on it.  While holding the IRU \nwith one hand, turn the top counter-clockwise as \nfar as it will go. \n\n \n\n \nLine up the blue line on the top of the IRU with \nthe unlock symbol on the top of the base. \n \nPush the IRU gently into the base.  Do not force, \nit should easily drop into place. (If the new IRU \ndoes not drop into place or fits tightly, remove \nand try again). \n\n \n\nTurn the top of the IRU clockwise until the blue \nline points to the lock symbol on the top of the \nbase.  The new IRU is now locked in place. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
