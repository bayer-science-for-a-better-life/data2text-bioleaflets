NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nFebuxostat Krka 80 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 80 mg febuxostat.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect\n- lactose: 73 mg\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet)\n\nOff pink, oval, biconvex, film-coated tablets scored on one side. Tablet dimension: approximatelly \n16 mm \u00d7 8 mm. The score line is only to facilitate breaking for ease of swallowing and not to divide \ninto equal doses.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFebuxostat Krka is indicated for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate \ndeposition has already occurred (including a history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis).\n\nFebuxostat Krka is indicated in adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended oral dose of Febuxostat Krka is 80 mg once daily without regard to food. If serum \nuric acid is > 6 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) after 2-4 weeks, Febuxostat Krka 120 mg once daily may be \nconsidered.\n\nFebuxostat Krka works sufficiently quickly to allow retesting of the serum uric acid after 2 weeks. The \ntherapeutic target is to decrease and maintain serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L).\n\nGout flare prophylaxis of at least 6 months is recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, see section 5.2).\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child Pugh Class C).\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe recommended dose in patients with mild hepatic impairment is 80 mg. Limited information is \navailable in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Febuxostat Krka in children below the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use\nFebuxostat Krka should be taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. (see also \nsection 4.8).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCardiovascular disorders\n\nTreatment with febuxostat in patients with pre-existing major cardiovascular diseases (e.g. myocardial \ninfarction, stroke or unstable angina) should be avoided, unless no other therapy options are \nappropriate.\n\nA numerical greater incidence of investigator-reported cardiovascular APTC events (defined endpoints \nfrom the Anti-Platelet Trialists\u2019 Collaboration (APTC) including cardiovascular death, non-fatal \nmyocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke) was observed in the febuxostat total group compared to the \nallopurinol group in the APEX and FACT studies (1.3 vs. 0.3 events per 100 Patient Years (PYs)), but \nnot in the CONFIRMS study (see section 5.1 for detailed characteristics of the studies). The incidence \nof investigator-reported cardiovascular APTC events in the combined Phase 3 studies (APEX, FACT \nand CONFIRMS studies) was 0.7 vs. 0.6 events per 100 PYs. In the long-term extension studies the \nincidences of investigator-reported APTC events were 1.2 and 0.6 events per 100 PYs for febuxostat \nand allopurinol, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found and no causal \nrelationship with febuxostat was established. Identified risk factors among these patients were a \nmedical history of atherosclerotic disease and/or myocardial infarction, or of congestive heart failure.\nIn the post registrational CARES trial (see section 5.1 for detailed characteristics of the study) the rate \nof MACE events was similar in febuxostat versus allopurinol treated patients (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.87-\n1.23), but a higher rate of cardiovascular deaths was observed (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; \n95% CI 1.03-1.73). \n\nMedicinal product allergy / hypersensitivity\n\nRare reports of serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute anaphylactic reaction/shock, have been collected in \nthe post-marketing experience. In most cases, these reactions occurred during the first month of \ntherapy with febuxostat. Some, but not all of these patients reported renal impairment and/or previous \nhypersensitivity to allopurinol. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Drug Reaction with \nEosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) were associated with fever, haematological, renal or \nhepatic involvement in some cases.\n\nPatients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for symptoms of \nallergic/hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). Febuxostat treatment should be immediately \nstopped if serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, occur \nsince early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis. If patient has developed \nallergic/hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and acute anaphylactic \nreaction/shock, febuxostat must not be re-started in this patient at any time.\n\n\n\n4\n\nAcute gouty attacks (gout flare)\n\nFebuxostat treatment should not be started until an acute attack of gout has completely subsided. Gout \nflares may occur during initiation of treatment due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in \nmobilization of urate from tissue deposits (see section 4.8 and 5.1). At treatment initiation with \nfebuxostat flare prophylaxis for at least 6 months with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nIf a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, it should not be discontinued. The gout flare should \nbe managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment with \nfebuxostat decreases frequency and intensity of gout flares.\n\nXanthine deposition\n\nIn patients in whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g. malignant disease and its \ntreatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, \nrise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract. As there has been no experience with \nfebuxostat, its use in these populations is not recommended.\n\nMercaptopurine/azathioprine\n\nFebuxostat use is not recommended in patients concomitantly treated with \nmercaptopurine/azathioprine as inhibition of xanthine oxidase by febuxostat may cause increased \nplasma concentrations of mercaptopurine/azathioprine that could result in severe toxicity. No \ninteraction studies have been performed in humans.\nWhere the combination cannot be avoided, a reduction of the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine is \nrecommended. Based on modelling and simulation analysis of data from a pre-clinical study in rats, \nwhen coadministered with febuxostat, the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to \nthe 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see \nsection 4.5 and 5.3).\n\nThe patients should be closely monitored and the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be \nsubsequently adjusted based on the evaluation of the therapeutic response and the onset of eventual \ntoxic effects.\n\nOrgan transplant recipients\n\nAs there has been no experience in organ transplant recipients, the use of febuxostat in such patients is \nnot recommended (see section 5.1).\n\nTheophylline\n\nCo-administration of febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline 400 mg single dose in healthy subjects \nshowed absence of any pharmacokinetic interaction (see section 4.5). Febuxostat 80 mg can be used in \npatients concomitantly treated with theophylline without risk of increasing theophylline plasma levels. \nNo data is available for febuxostat 120 mg.\n\nLiver disorders\n\nDuring the combined phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in \npatients treated with febuxostat (5.0%). Liver function test is recommended prior to the initiation of \ntherapy with febuxostat and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgment (see section 5.1).\n\nThyroid disorders\n\nIncreased TSH values (>5.5 \u03bcIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term treatment with \n\n\n\n5\n\nfebuxostat (5.5%) in the long term open label extension studies. Caution is required when febuxostat is \nused in patients with alteration of thyroid function (see section 5.1).\n\nExcipients\n\nFebuxostat Krka contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nMercaptopurine/azathioprine\n\nOn the basis of the mechanism of action of febuxostat on XO inhibition concomitant use is not \nrecommended. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these \ndrugs leading to toxicity . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with drugs (except theophylline) that \nare metabolized by XO have not been performed in humans.\nModelling and simulation analysis of data from a pre-clinical study in rats indicates that, in case of \nconcomitant administration with febuxostat, the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be \nreduced to 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose (see section 4.4 and 5.3).\n\nDrug interaction studies of febuxostat with other cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No \ndata is available regarding the safety of febuxostat during other cytotoxic therapy.\n\nRosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates\n\nFebuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, \ncoadministration of 120 mg febuxostat QD with a single 4 mg oral dose of rosiglitazone had no effect \non the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone and its metabolite N-desmethyl rosiglitazone, indicating that \nfebuxostat is not a CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor in vivo. Thus, co-administration of febuxostat with \nrosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those \ncompounds.\n\nTheophylline\n\nAn interaction study in healthy subjects has been performed with febuxostat to evaluate whether the \ninhibition of XO may cause an increase in the theophylline circulating levels as reported with other \nXO inhibitors. The results of the study showed that the co-administration of febuxostat 80 mg QD \nwith theophylline 400 mg single dose has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety of theophylline. \nTherefore no special caution is advised when febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline are given \nconcomitantly. No data is available for febuxostat 120 mg.\n\nNaproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation\n\nFebuxostat metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal \nproducts that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the \nelimination of febuxostat. In healthy subjects concomitant use of febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg \ntwice daily was associated with an increase in febuxostat exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1/2 \n26%). In clinical studies the use of naproxen or other NSAIDs/Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to any \nclinically significant increase in adverse events.\n\nFebuxostat can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of febuxostat or naproxen \nbeing necessary.\n\nInducers of glucuronidation\n\n\n\n6\n\nPotent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy \nof febuxostat. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of \ntreatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer \nmight lead to increased plasma levels of febuxostat.\n\nColchicine/indometacin/hydrochlorothiazide/warfarin\n\nFebuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of \nfebuxostat or the co-administered active substance being necessary.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when administered with hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when administered with febuxostat. Administration of \nfebuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nwarfarin in healthy subjects. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the co-\nadministration of febuxostat.\n\nDesipramine/CYP2D6 substrates\n\nFebuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, \n120 mg febuxostat QD resulted in a mean 22% increase in AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate \nindicating a potential weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo. Thus, co-\nadministration of febuxostat with other CYP2D6 substrates is not expected to require any dose \nadjustment for those compounds.\n\nAntacids\n\nConcomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has \nbeen shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in \nCmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without \nregard to antacid use.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nData on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies have not indicated any adverse effects of \nfebuxostat on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/new born child. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development or \nparturition (see section 5.3). The potential risk for human is unknown. Febuxostat should not be used \nduring pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether febuxostat is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of this active substance in breast milk and an impaired development of suckling pups. A risk \nto a suckling infant cannot be excluded. Febuxostat should not be used while breastfeeding.\n\nFertility\n\nIn animals, reproduction studies up to 48 mg/kg/day showed no dose-dependent adverse effects on \nfertility (see section 5.3). The effect of Febuxostat Krka on human fertility is unknown.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSomnolence, dizziness, paraesthesia and blurred vision have been reported with the use of febuxostat. \nPatients should exercise caution before driving, using machinery or participating in dangerous \n\n\n\n7\n\nactivities until they are reasonably certain that Febuxostat Krka does not adversely affect performance.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials (4,072 subjects treated at least with a \ndose from 10 mg to 300 mg) and post-marketing experience are gout flares, liver function \nabnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly \nmild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, some of which \nwere associated to systemic symptoms, and rare events of sudden cardiac death, have occurred in the \npost-marketing experience.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) and rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nadverse reactions occurring in patients treated with febuxostat are listed below.\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions in combined phase 3, long-term extension studies and post-marketing \nexperience\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Rare\n\nPancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, \nagranulocytosis* \n\nImmune system disorders Rare\nAnaphylactic reaction*, drug hypersensitivity* \n\nEndocrine disorders Uncommon\nBlood thyroid stimulating hormone increased \n\nEye disorders Rare\nBlurred vision \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common***\nGout flares\nUncommon\nDiabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, decrease \nappetite, weight increase\nRare\nWeight decrease, increase appetite, anorexia \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon\nLibido decreased, insomnia\nRare\nNervousness \n\nNervous system disorders Common\nHeadache\nUncommon\nDizziness, paraesthesia, hemiparesis, \nsomnolence, altered taste, hypoaesthesia, \nhyposmia \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Rare\nTinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon\nAtrial fibrillation, palpitations, ECG abnormal\nRare\nSudden cardiac death*\n\nVascular disorders Uncommon\nHypertension, flushing, hot flush\n\nRespiratory system disorders Uncommon\n\n\n\n8\n\nDyspnoea, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract \ninfection, cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common\nDiarrhoea**, nausea\nUncommon\nAbdominal pain, abdominal distension, gastro-\noesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, dry mouth, \ndyspepsia, constipation, frequent stools, \nflatulence, gastrointestinal discomfort\nRare\nPancreatitis, mouth ulceration \n\nHepato-biliary disorders Common\nLiver function abnormalities**\nUncommon\nCholelithiasis\nRare\nHepatitis, jaundice*, liver injury* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common\nRash (including various types of rash reported \nwith lower frequencies, see below)\nUncommon\nDermatitis, urticaria, pruritus, skin \ndiscolouration, skin lesion, petechiae, rash \nmacular, rash maculopapular, rash papular\nRare\nToxic epidermal necrolysis*, Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome*, angioedema*, drug reaction with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms*, \ngeneralized rash (serious)*, erythema, exfoliative \nrash, rash follicular, rash vesicular, rash pustular, \nrash pruritic*, rash erythematous, rash \nmorbillifom, alopecia, hyperhidrosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Uncommon\nArthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, musculoskeletal \npain, muscle weakness, muscle spasm, muscle \ntightness, bursitis\nRare\nRhabdomyolysis*, joint stiffness, \nmusculoskeletal stiffness \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon\nRenal failure, nephrolithiasis, haematuria, \npollakiuria, proteinuria\nRare\nTubulointerstitial nephritis*, micturition urgency \n\nReproductive system and breast disorder Uncommon\nErectile dysfunction \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nCommon\nOedema\nUncommon\nFatigue, chest pain, chest discomfort\nRare\nThirst \n\nInvestigations Uncommon\nBlood amylase increase, platelet count decrease, \nWBC decrease, lymphocyte count decrease, \nblood creatine increase, blood creatinine \nincrease, haemoglobin decrease, blood urea \n\n\n\n9\n\nincrease, blood triglycerides increase, blood \ncholesterol increase, haematocritic decrease, \nblood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood \npotassium increase\nRare\nBlood glucose increase, activated partial \nthromboplastin time prolonged, red blood cell \ncount decrease, blood alkaline phosphatase \nincrease, blood creatine phosphokinase increase* \n\n* Adverse reactions coming from post-marketing experience\n** Treatment-emergent non-infective diarrhoea and abnormal liver function tests in the combined \nPhase 3 studies are more frequent in patients concomitantly treated with colchicine.\n*** See section 5.1 for incidences of gout flares in the individual Phase 3 randomized controlled \nstudies.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic \nepidermal necrolysis and anaphylactic reaction/shock, have occurred in the post-marketing experience. \nStevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic epidermal necrolysis are characterised by progressive skin \nrashes associated with blisters or mucosal lesions and eye irritation. Hypersensitivity reactions to \nfebuxostat can be associated to the following symptoms: skin reactions characterised by infiltrated \nmaculopapular eruption, generalised or exfoliative rashes, but also skin lesions, facial oedema, fever, \nhaematologic abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia, and single or multiple organ \ninvolvement (liver and kidney including tubulointerstitial nephritis) (see section 4.4).\n\nGout flares were commonly observed soon after the start of treatment and during the first months. \nThereafter, the frequency of gout flare decreases in a time-dependent manner. Gout flare prophylaxis \nis recommended (see section 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nPatients with an overdose should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antigout preparations, preparations inhibiting uric acid production; ATC \ncode: M04AA03.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nUric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of \nhypoxanthine \u2192 xanthine \u2192 uric acid. Both steps in the above transformations are catalyzed by \nxanthine oxidase (XO). Febuxostat is a 2-arylthiazole derivative that achieves its therapeutic effect of \ndecreasing serum uric acid by selectively inhibiting XO. Febuxostat is a potent, non-purine selective \ninhibitor of XO (NP-SIXO) with an in vitro inhibition Ki value less than one nanomolar. Febuxostat \nhas been shown to potently inhibit both the oxidized and reduced forms of XO. At therapeutic \n\nIJ\n\n\n\n10\n\nconcentrations febuxostat does not inhibit other enzymes involved in purine or pyrimidine \nmetabolism, namely, guanine deaminase, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, orotate \nphosphoribosyltransferase, orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase or purine nucleoside \nphosphorylase.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three Phase 3 pivotal studies (the two pivotal APEX \nand FACT studies, and the additional CONFIRMS study described below) that were conducted in \n4101 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout. In each phase 3 pivotal study, febuxostat demonstrated \nsuperior ability to lower and maintain serum uric acid levels compared to allopurinol. The primary \nefficacy endpoint in the APEX and FACT studies was the proportion of patients whose last 3 monthly \nserum uric acid levels were < 6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L). In the additional phase 3 CONFIRMS study, \nfor which results became available after the marketing authorisation for febuxostat was first issued, the \nprimary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients whose serum urate level was < 6.0 mg/dL at \nthe final visit. No patients with organ transplant have been included in these studies (see section 4.2).\n\nAPEX Study: The Allopurinol and Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Study of Febuxostat (APEX) was a \nPhase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 28-week study. One thousand and seventy-two (1072) \npatients were randomized: placebo (n=134), febxuostat 80 mg QD (n=267), febuxostat 120 mg QD \n(n=269), febuxostat 240 mg QD (n=134) or allopurinol (300 mg QD [n=258] for patients with a \nbaseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg QD [n=10] for patients with a baseline serum \ncreatinine >1.5 mg/dL and \u22642.0 mg/dL). Two hundred and forty mg febuxostat (2 times the \nrecommended highest dose) was used as a safety evaluation dose.\n\nThe APEX study showed statistically significant superiority of both the febuxostat 80 mg QD and the \nfebuxostat 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n \n= 258) /100 mg (n = 10) treatment arm in reducing the sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) (see Table 2 \nand Figure 1).\n\nFACT Study: The Febuxostat Allopurinol Controlled Trial (FACT) Study was a Phase 3, randomized, \ndouble-blind, multicenter, 52-week study. Seven hundred sixty (760) patients were randomized: \nfebuxostat 80 mg QD (n=256), febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=251), or allopurinol 300 mg QD (n=253).\n\nThe FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of both febuxostat 80 mg and \nfebuxostat 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 300 mg \ntreatment arm in reducing and maintaining sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L).\n\nTable 2 summarises the primary efficacy endpoint results:\n\nTable 2\nProportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels <6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L)\n\nLast Three Monthly Visits\n\nStudy Febuxostat\n80 mg QD\n\nFebuxostat \n120 mg QD\n\nAllopurinol 300 / \n100 mg QD1\n\nAPEX\n(28 weeks)\n\n48%*\n\n(n=262)\n65%*, #\n\n(n=269)\n22%\n\n(n=268)\nFACT\n\n(52 weeks)\n53%*\n\n(n=255)\n62%*\n\n(n=250)\n21 %\n\n(n=251)\nCombined\n\nResults\n51%*\n\n(n=517)\n63%*, #\n\n(n=519)\n22%\n\n(n=519)\n1results from subjects receiving either 100 mg QD (n=10: patients with serum \ncreatinine >1.5 and \u22642.0 mg/dL) or 300 mg QD (n=509) were pooled for \nanalyses.\n* p < 0.001 vs allopurinol, # p < 0.001 vs 80 mg \n\n\n\n11\n\nThe ability of febuxostat to lower serum uric acid levels was prompt and persistent.

Two thousand and two hundred-sixty \nnine (2269) patients were randomized: febuxostat 40 mg QD (n=757), febuxostat 80 mg QD (n=756), \nor allopurinol 300/200 mg QD (n=756). At least 65% of the patients had mild-moderate renal \nimpairment (with creatinine clearance of 30-89 mL/min). Prophylaxis against gout flares was \nobligatory over the 26-week period.\nThe proportion of patients with serum urate levels of < 6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) at the final visit, was \n45% for 40 mg febuxostat, 67% for febuxostat 80 mg and 42% for allopurinol 300/200 mg, \nrespectively.\n\nPrimary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with renal impairment\nThe APEX Study evaluated efficacy in 40 patients with renal impairment (i.e., baseline serum \ncreatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642.0 mg/dL). For renally impaired subjects who were randomized to \nallopurinol, the dose was capped at 100 mg QD. Febuxostat achieved the primary efficacy endpoint in \n44% (80 mg QD), 45% (120 mg QD), and 60% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 0% in the \nallopurinol 100 mg QD and placebo groups.\n\nThere were no clinically significant differences in the percent decrease in serum uric acid \nconcentration in healthy subjects irrespective of their renal function (58% in the normal renal function \ngroup and 55% in the severe renal dysfunction group).\n\nAn analysis in patients with gout and renal impairment was prospectively defined in the CONFIRMS \n\n\n\n12\n\nstudy, and showed that febuxostat was significantly more efficacious in lowering serum urate levels to \n< 6 mg/dL compared to allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg in patients who had gout with mild to moderate \nrenal impairment (65% of patients studied).\n\nPrimary endpoint in the sub group of patients with sUA \u2265 10 mg/dL\nApproximately 40% of patients (combined APEX and FACT) had a baseline sUA of \u2265 10 mg/dL. In \nthis subgroup febuxostat achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < 6.0 mg/dL at the last 3 visits) \nin 41% (80 mg QD), 48% (120 mg QD), and 66% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 9% in the \nallopurinol 300 mg/100 mg QD and 0 % in the placebo groups.\n\nIn the CONFIRMS study, the proportion of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < \n6.0 mg/dL at the final visit) for patients with a baseline serum urate level of \u2265 10 mg/dL treated with \nfebuxostat 40 mg QD was 27% (66/249), with febuxostat 80 mg QD 49% (125/254) and with \nallopurinol 300 mg/200 mg QD 31% (72/230), respectively.\n\nClinical Outcomes: proportion of patients requiring treatment for a gout flare\nAPEX study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the febuxostat \n120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for gout flare compared to febuxostat 80 mg (28%), \nallopurinol 300 mg (23%) and placebo (20%). Flares increased following the prophylaxis period and \ngradually decreased over time. Between 46% and 55% of subjects received treatment for gout flares \nfrom Week 8 and Week 28. Gout flares during the last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 24-28) were \nobserved in 15% (febuxostat 80, 120 mg), 14% (allopurinol 300 mg) and 20% (placebo) of subjects.\n\nFACT study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the febuxostat \n120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for a gout flare compared to both the febuxostat \n80 mg (22%) and allopurinol 300 mg (21%) treatment groups. After the 8-week prophylaxis period, \nthe incidences of flares increased and gradually decreased over time (64% and 70% of subjects \nreceived treatment for gout flares from Week 8-52). Gout flares during the last 4 weeks of the study \n(Weeks 49-52) were observed in 6-8% (febuxostat 80 mg, 120 mg) and 11% (allopurinol 300 mg) of \nsubjects.\n\nThe proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare (APEX and FACT Study) was \nnumerically lower in the groups that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate level <6.0 mg/dL, \n<5.0 mg/dL, or <4.0 mg/dL compared to the group that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate \nlevel \u22656.0 mg/dL during the last 32 weeks of the treatment period (Week 20-Week 24 to Week 49 - 52 \nintervals).\n\nDuring the CONFIRMS study, the percentages of patients who required treatment for gout flares (Day \n1 through Month 6) were 31% and 25% for the febuxostat 80 mg and allopurinol groups, respectively. \nNo difference in the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares was observed between \nthe febuxostat 80 mg and 40 mg groups.\n\nLong-term, open label extension studies\nEXCEL Study (C02-021): The Excel study was a three years Phase 3, open label, multicenter, \nrandomised, allopurinol-controlled, safety extension study for patients who had completed the pivotal \nPhase 3 studies (APEX or FACT). A total of 1,086 patients were enrolled: febuxostat 80 mg QD \n(n=649), febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=292) and allopurinol 300/100 mg QD (n=145). About 69 % of \npatients required no treatment change to achieve a final stable treatment. Patients who had 3 \nconsecutive sUA levels >6.0 mg/dL were withdrawn.\nSerum urate levels were maintained over time (i.e. 91% and 93% of patients on initial treatment with \nfebuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg, respectively, had sUA <6 mg/dL at Month 36).\nThree years data showed a decrease in the incidence of gout flares with less than 4% of patients \nrequiring treatment for a flare (i.e. more than 96% of patients did not require treatment for a flare) at \nMonth 16-24 and at Month 30-36.\n\n46% and 38%, of patients on final stable treatment of febuxostat 80 or 120 mg QD, respectively, had \ncomplete resolution of the primary palpable tophus from baseline to the Final Visit.\n\n\n\n13\n\nFOCUS Study (TMX-01-005) was a 5 years Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, safety extension study \nfor patients who had completed the febuxostat 4 weeks of double blind dosing in study TMX-00-004.\n\n116 patients were enrolled and received initially febuxostat 80 mg QD. 62% of patients required no \ndose adjustment to maintain sUA <6 mg/dL and 38% of patients required a dose adjustment to achieve \na final stable dose.\n\nThe proportion of patients with serum urate levels of <6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) at the final visit was \ngreater than 80% (81-100%) at each febuxostat dose.\n\nDuring the phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in patients \ntreated with febuxostat (5.0%). These rates were similar to the rates reported on allopurinol (4.2%) \n(see section 4.4). Increased TSH values (>5.5 \u03bcIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term \ntreatment with febuxostat (5.5%) and patients with allopurinol (5.8%) in the long term open label \nextension studies (see section 4.4).\n\nPost Marketing long term studies\nCARES Study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, non inferiority trial comparing CV \noutcomes with febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout and a history of major CV \ndisease including MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary or cerebral revascularization \nprocedure, stroke, hospitalized transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes \nmellitus with evidence of microvascular or macrovascular disease. To achieve sUA less than 6 \nmg/dL, the dose of febuxostat was titrated from 40 mg up to 80 mg (regardless of renal \nfunction) and the dose of allopurinol was titrated in 100 mg increments from 300 to 600 mg in \npatients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment and from 200 to 400 mg in \npatients with moderate renal impairment.\nThe primary endpoint in CARES was the time to first occurrence of MACE, a composite of non-fatal \nMI, non-fatal stroke, CV death and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization.\nThe endpoints (primary and secondary) were analysed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) \nanalysis including all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind \nstudy medication.\nOverall 56.6% of patients discontinued trial treatment prematurely and 45% of patients did not \ncomplete all trial visits.\nIn total, 6,190 patients were followed for a median of 32 months and the median duration of exposure \nwas 728 days for patients in febuxostat group (n 3098) and 719 days in allopurinol group (n 3092).\nThe primary MACE endpoint occurred at similar rates in the febuxostat and allopurinol treatment \ngroups (10.8% vs. 10.4% of patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; two-sided repeated 95%\nconfidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.23).\nIn the analysis of the individual components of MACE, the rate of CV deaths was higher with \nfebuxostat than allopurinol (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73). The rates of the \nother MACE events were similar in the febuxostat and allopurinol groups, i.e. non-fatal MI (3.6% vs. \n3.8% of patients; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.72-1.21), non-fatal stroke (2.3% vs. 2.3% of patients; HR 1.01; \n95% CI 0.73-1.41) and urgent revascularization due to unstable angina (1.6% vs. 1.8% of patients; \nHR 0.86; 95% CI 0.59-1.26).  The rate of all-cause mortality was also higher with febuxostat than \nallopurinol (7.8% vs. 6.4% of patients; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47), which was mainly driven by the \nhigher rate of CV deaths in that group (see section 4.4).\nRates of adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure, hospital admissions for arrhythmias not \nassociated with ischemia, venous thromboembolic events and hospitalization for transient ischemic \nattacks were comparable for febuxostat and allopurinol.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nIn healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration \ntime curve (AUC) of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple \ndoses of 10 mg to 120 mg. For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a greater than dose proportional \n\n\n\n14\n\nincrease in AUC is observed for febuxostat. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of \n10 mg to 240 mg are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal \nelimination half-life (t1/2) of approximately 5 to 8 hours.\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted in 211 patients with \nhyperuricaemia and gout, treated with febuxostat 40-240 mg QD. In general, febuxostat \npharmacokinetic parameters estimated by these analyses are consistent with those obtained from \nhealthy subjects, indicating that healthy subjects are representative for \npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment in the patient population with gout.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFebuxostat is rapidly (tmax of 1.0-1.5 h) and well absorbed (at least 84%). After single or multiple oral \n80 and 120 mg once daily doses, Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 \u03bcg/mL, and 5.0-5.3 \u03bcg/mL, \nrespectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet formulation has not been studied.\n\nFollowing multiple oral 80 mg once daily doses or a single 120 mg dose with a high fat meal, there \nwas a 49% and 38% decrease in Cmax and a 18% and 16% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no \nclinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed \nwhere tested (80 mg multiple dose). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 L after oral \ndoses of 10-300 mg. The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to \nalbumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 80 and 120 mg doses. Plasma \nprotein binding of the active metabolites ranges from about 82% to 91%.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nFebuxostat is extensively metabolized by conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase \n(UDPGT) enzyme system and oxidation via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Four \npharmacologically active hydroxyl metabolites have been identified, of which three occur in plasma of \nhumans. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that those oxidative metabolites were \nformed primarily by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 and febuxostat glucuronide was \nformed mainly by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9.\n\nElimination\n\nFebuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14C-\nlabeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat \n(3%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their \nconjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, \napproximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the \nacyl glucuronide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates\n(25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%).\n\nRenal impairment\n\nFollowing multiple doses of 80 mg of febuxostat in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment, the Cmax of febuxostat did not change, relative to subjects with normal renal function. The \nmean total AUC of febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8-fold from 7.5 \u03bcg\u22c5h/mL in the normal \nrenal function group to 13.2 \u03bcg.h/mL in the severe renal dysfunction group. The Cmax and AUC of \nactive metabolites increased up to 2- and 4-fold, respectively. However, no dose adjustment is \nnecessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\n\n\n15\n\nFollowing multiple doses of 80 mg of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or \nmoderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the Cmax and AUC of febuxostat and its \nmetabolites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. No \nstudies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\n\nAge\n\nThere were no significant changes observed in AUC of febuxostat or its metabolites following \nmultiple oral doses of febuxostat in elderly as compared to younger healthy subjects.\n\nGender\n\nFollowing multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the Cmax and AUC were 24% and 12% higher in females \nthan in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar between the \ngenders. No dose adjustment is needed based on gender.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were generally observed at exposures in excess of the maximum human \nexposure.\n\nPharmacokinetic modelling and simulation of rat data suggests that, when co-administered with \nfebuxostat, the clinical dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to 20% or less of the \npreviously prescribed dose in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see section 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility\n\nIn male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell papilloma \nand carcinoma) was found only in association with xanthine calculi in the high dose group, at \napproximately 11 times human exposure. There was no significant increase in any other tumour type \nin either male or female mice or rats. These findings are considered a consequence of species specific \npurine metabolism and urine composition and of no relevance to clinical use.\n\nA standard battery of test for genotoxicity did not reveal any biologically relevant genotoxic effects \nfor febuxostat.\n\nFebuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive \nperformance of male and female rats.\n\nThere was no evidence of impaired fertility, teratogenic effects, or harm to the foetus due to \nfebuxostat. There was high dose maternal toxicity accompanied by a reduction in weaning index and \nreduced development of offspring in rats at approximately 4.3 times human exposure. Teratology \nstudies, performed in pregnant rats at approximately 4.3 times and pregnant rabbits at approximately \n13 times human exposure did not reveal any teratogenic effects.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nFebuxostat Krka 120 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 120 mg febuxostat.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect\n- lactose: 109 mg\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet)\n\nBrownish yellow, slightly biconvex, capsule shaped film-coated tablets scored on both sides. Tablet \ndimension: approximatelly 19 mm \u00d7 8 mm. The score line is only to facilitate breaking for ease of \nswallowing and not to divide into equal doses.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFebuxostat Krka is indicated for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate \ndeposition has already occurred (including a history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis).\n\nFebuxostat Krka is indicated for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in adult patients \nundergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at intermediate to high risk of Tumor Lysis \nSyndrome (TLS).\n\nFebuxostat Krka is indicated in adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nGout: The recommended oral dose of Febuxostat Krka is 80 mg once daily without regard to food. If \nserum uric acid is > 6 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) after 2-4 weeks, Febuxostat Krka 120 mg once daily may \nbe considered.\n\nFebuxostat Krka works sufficiently quickly to allow retesting of the serum uric acid after 2 weeks. The \ntherapeutic target is to decrease and maintain serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L).\n\nGout flare prophylaxis of at least 6 months is recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nTumor Lysis Syndrome:\nThe reccomended oral dose of  Febuxostat Krka is 120 mg once daily without regard to food. \nFebuxostat Krka should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued \nfor a minimum of 7 days; however treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to \nchemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.\n\nElderly\n\n\n\n19\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, see section 5.2).\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child Pugh Class C).\nGout: The recommended dose in patients with mild hepatic impairment is 80 mg. Limited information \nis available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nTumour Lysis Syndrome: in the pivotal Phase III trial (FLORENCE) only subjects with severe hepatic \ninsufficiency were excluded from trial participation. No dose adjustment was required for enrolled \npatients on the basis of hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Febuxostat Krka in children below the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use\nFebuxostat Krka should be taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. (see also \nsection 4.8).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCardiovascular disorders\n\nTreatment of chronic hyperuricaemia\nTreatment with febuxostat in patients with pre-existing major cardiovascular diseases (e.g. myocardial \ninfarction, stroke or unstable angina) should be avoided, unless no other therapy options are \nappropriate.\n\nA numerical greater incidence of investigator-reported cardiovascular APTC events (defined endpoints \nfrom the Anti-Platelet Trialists\u2019 Collaboration (APTC) including cardiovascular death, non-fatal \nmyocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke) was observed in the febuxostat total group compared to the \nallopurinol group in the APEX and FACT studies (1.3 vs. 0.3 events per 100 Patient Years (PYs)), but \nnot in the CONFIRMS study (see section 5.1 for detailed characteristics of the studies). The incidence \nof investigator-reported cardiovascular APTC events in the combined Phase 3 studies (APEX, FACT \nand CONFIRMS studies) was 0.7 vs. 0.6 events per 100 PYs. In the long-term extension studies the \nincidences of investigator-reported APTC events were 1.2 and 0.6 events per 100 PYs for febuxostat \nand allopurinol, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found and no causal \nrelationship with febuxostat was established. Identified risk factors among these patients were a \nmedical history of atherosclerotic disease and/or myocardial infarction, or of congestive heart failure.\nIn the post registrational CARES trial (see section 5.1 for detailed characteristics of the study) the rate \nof MACE events was similar in febuxostat versus allopurinol treated patients (HR 1.03;95% CI 0.87-\n1.23), but a higher rate of cardiovascular deaths was observed (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; \n95% CI 1.03-1.73). \n\nPrevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in patients at risk of TLS\n\n\n\n20\n\nPatients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at intermediate to high risk of \nTumor Lysis Syndrome treated with febuxostat should be under cardiac monitoring as clinically \nappropriate.\n\nMedicinal product allergy / hypersensitivity\n\nRare reports of serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute anaphylactic reaction/shock, have been collected in \nthe post-marketing experience. In most cases, these reactions occurred during the first month of \ntherapy with febuxostat. Some, but not all of these patients reported renal impairment and/or previous \nhypersensitivity to allopurinol. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Drug Reaction with \nEosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) were associated with fever, haematological, renal or \nhepatic involvement in some cases.\n\nPatients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for symptoms of \nallergic/hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). Febuxostat treatment should be immediately \nstopped if serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, occur \nsince early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis. If patient has developed \nallergic/hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and acute anaphylactic \nreaction/shock, febuxostat must not be re-started in this patient at any time.\n\nAcute gouty attacks (gout flare)\n\nFebuxostat treatment should not be started until an acute attack of gout has completely subsided. Gout \nflares may occur during initiation of treatment due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in \nmobilization of urate from tissue deposits (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). At treatment initiation with \nfebuxostat flare prophylaxis for at least 6 months with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nIf a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, it should not be discontinued. The gout flare should \nbe managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment with \nfebuxostat decreases frequency and intensity of gout flares.\n\nXanthine deposition\n\nIn patients in whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g. malignant disease and its \ntreatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, \nrise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract. This has not been observed in the pivotal \nclinical study with febuxostat in the Tumor Lysis Syndrome. As there has been no experience with \nfebuxostat, its use in patients with Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome is not recommended.\n\nMercaptopurine/azathioprine\n\nFebuxostat use is not recommended in patients concomitantly treated with \nmercaptopurine/azathioprine as inhibition of xanthine oxidase by febuxostat may cause increased \nplasma concentrations of mercaptopurine/azathioprine that could result in severe toxicity. No \ninteraction studies have been performed in humans. \nWhere the combination cannot be avoided, a reduction of the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine is \nrecommended. Based on modelling and simulation analysis of data from a pre-clinical study in rats, \nwhen coadministered with febuxostat, the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to \nthe 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see \nsection 4.5 and 5.3).\n\nThe patients should be closely monitored and the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be \nsubsequently adjusted based on the evaluation of the therapeutic response and the onset of eventual \ntoxic effects.\n\n\n\n21\n\nOrgan transplant recipients\n\nAs there has been no experience in organ transplant recipients, the use of febuxostat in such patients is \nnot recommended (see section 5.1).\n\nTheophylline\n\nCo-administration of febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline 400 mg single dose in healthy subjects \nshowed absence of any pharmacokinetic interaction (see section 4.5). Febuxostat 80 mg can be used in \npatients concomitantly treated with theophylline without risk of increasing theophylline plasma levels. \nNo data is available for febuxostat 120 mg.\n\nLiver disorders\n\nDuring the combined phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in \npatients treated with febuxostat (5.0%). Liver function test is recommended prior to the initiation of \ntherapy with febuxostat and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgment (see section 5.1).\n\nThyroid disorders\n\nIncreased TSH values (>5.5 \u03bcIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term treatment with \nfebuxostat (5.5%) in the long term open label extension studies. Caution is required when febuxostat is \nused in patients with alteration of thyroid function (see section 5.1).\n\nExcipients\n\nFebuxostat Krka contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nMercaptopurine/azathioprine\n\nOn the basis of the mechanism of action of febuxostat on XO inhibition concomitant use is not \nrecommended. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these \ndrugs leading to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with drugs (except theophylline) that \nare metabolized by XO have not been performed in humans.\nModelling and simulation analysis of data from a pre-clinical study in rats indicates that, in case of \nconcomitant administration with febuxostat, the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be \nreduced to the 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose (see section 4.4 and 5.3).\n\nDrug interaction studies of febuxostat with other cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. In \nthe Tumor Lysis Syndrome pivotal trial febuxostat 120 mg daily was administered to patients \nundergoing several chemotherapy regimens, including monoclonal antibodies. However, drug-drug \nand drug-disease interactions were not explored during this study. Therefore, possible interactions \nwith any concomitantly administered cytotoxic drug cannot be ruled out.\n\nRosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates\n\nFebuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, \ncoadministration of 120 mg febuxostat QD with a single 4 mg oral dose of rosiglitazone had no effect \non the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone and its metabolite N-desmethyl rosiglitazone, indicating that \nfebuxostat is not a CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor in vivo. Thus, co-administration of febuxostat with \nrosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those \ncompounds.\n\n\n\n22\n\nTheophylline\n\nAn interaction study in healthy subjects has been performed with febuxostat to evaluate whether the \ninhibition of XO may cause an increase in the theophylline circulating levels as reported with other \nXO inhibitors. The results of the study showed that the co-administration of febuxostat 80 mg QD \nwith theophylline 400 mg single dose has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety of theophylline. \nTherefore no special caution is advised when febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline are given \nconcomitantly. No data is available for febuxostat 120 mg.\n\nNaproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation\n\nFebuxostat metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal \nproducts that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the \nelimination of febuxostat. In healthy subjects concomitant use of febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg \ntwice daily was associated with an increase in febuxostat exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1/2 \n26%). In clinical studies the use of naproxen or other NSAIDs/Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to any \nclinically significant increase in adverse events.\n\nFebuxostat can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of febuxostat or naproxen \nbeing necessary.\n\nInducers of glucuronidation\n\nPotent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy \nof febuxostat. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of \ntreatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer \nmight lead to increased plasma levels of febuxostat.\n\nColchicine/indometacin/hydrochlorothiazide/warfarin\n\nFebuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of \nfebuxostat or the co-administered active substance being necessary.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when administered with hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when administered with febuxostat. Administration of \nfebuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nwarfarin in healthy subjects. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the co-\nadministration of febuxostat.\n\nDesipramine/CYP2D6 substrates\n\nFebuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, \n120 mg febuxostat QD resulted in a mean 22% increase in AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate \nindicating a potential weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo. Thus, co-\nadministration of febuxostat with other CYP2D6 substrates is not expected to require any dose \nadjustment for those compounds.\n\nAntacids\n\nConcomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has \nbeen shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in \nCmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without \nregard to antacid use.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\n\n\n23\n\nPregnancy\n\nData on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies have not indicated any adverse effects of \nfebuxostat on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/new born child. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development or \nparturition (see section 5.3). The potential risk for human is unknown. Febuxostat should not be used \nduring pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether febuxostat is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of this active substance in breast milk and an impaired development of suckling pups. A risk \nto a suckling infant cannot be excluded. Febuxostat should not be used while breastfeeding.\n\nFertility\n\nIn animals, reproduction studies up to 48 mg/kg/day showed no dose-dependent adverse effects on \nfertility (see section 5.3). The effect of Febuxostat Krka on human fertility is unknown.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSomnolence, dizziness, paraesthesia and blurred vision have been reported with the use of febuxostat. \nPatients should exercise caution before driving, using machinery or participating in dangerous \nactivities until they are reasonably certain that Febuxostat Krka does not adversely affect performance.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials (4,072 subjects treated at least with a \ndose from 10 mg to 300 mg) and post-marketing experience in gout patients are gout flares, liver \nfunction abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were \nmostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, some of \nwhich were associated to systemic symptoms, and rare events of sudden cardiac death, have occurred \nin the post-marketing experience.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) and rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nadverse reactions occurring in patients treated with febuxostat are listed below.\nThe frequencies are based on studies and post-marketing experience in gout patients.\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions in combined phase 3, long-term extension studies and post-marketing \nexperience in gout patients.\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Rare\n\nPancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, \nagranulocytosis* \n\nImmune system disorders Rare\nAnaphylactic reaction*, drug hypersensitivity* \n\nEndocrine disorders Uncommon\nBlood thyroid stimulating hormone increased \n\nEye disorders Rare\nBlurred vision \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common***\n\n\n\n24\n\nGout flares\nUncommon\nDiabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, decrease \nappetite, weight increase\nRare\nWeight decrease, increase appetite, anorexia \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon\nLibido decreased, insomnia\nRare\nNervousness \n\nNervous system disorders Common\nHeadache\nUncommon\nDizziness, paraesthesia, hemiparesis, \nsomnolence, altered taste, hypoaesthesia, \nhyposmia \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Rare\nTinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon\nAtrial fibrillation, palpitations, ECG abnormal,\nleft bundle branch block (see section Tumor \nLysis Syndrome), sinus tachycardia (see section \nTumor Lysis Syndrome)\nRare\nSudden cardiac death*\n\nVascular disorders Uncommon\nHypertension, flushing, hot flush,\nhaemorrhage (see section Tumor Lysis \nSyndrome) \n\nRespiratory system disorders Uncommon\nDyspnoea, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract \ninfection, cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common\nDiarrhoea**, nausea\nUncommon\nAbdominal pain, abdominal distension, gastro-\noesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, dry mouth, \ndyspepsia, constipation, frequent stools, \nflatulence, gastrointestinal discomfort\nRare\nPancreatitis, mouth ulceration \n\nHepato-biliary disorders Common\nLiver function abnormalities**\nUncommon\nCholelithiasis\nRare\nHepatitis, jaundice*, liver injury* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common\nRash (including various types of rash reported \nwith lower frequencies, see below)\nUncommon\nDermatitis, urticaria, pruritus, skin \ndiscolouration, skin lesion, petechiae, rash \nmacular, rash maculopapular, rash papular\nRare\nToxic epidermal necrolysis*, Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome*, angioedema*, drug reaction with \n\n\n\n25\n\neosinophilia and systemic symptoms*, \ngeneralized rash (serious)*, erythema, exfoliative \nrash, rash follicular, rash vesicular, rash pustular, \nrash pruritic*, rash erythematous, rash \nmorbillifom, alopecia, hyperhidrosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Uncommon\nArthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, musculoskeletal \npain, muscle weakness, muscle spasm, muscle \ntightness, bursitis\nRare\nRhabdomyolysis*, joint stiffness, \nmusculoskeletal stiffness \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon\nRenal failure, nephrolithiasis, haematuria, \npollakiuria, proteinuria\nRare\nTubulointerstitial nephritis*, micturition urgency \n\nReproductive system and breast disorder Uncommon\nErectile dysfunction \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nCommon\nOedema\nUncommon\nFatigue, chest pain, chest discomfort\nRare\nThirst \n\nInvestigations Uncommon\nBlood amylase increase, platelet count decrease, \nWBC decrease, lymphocyte count decrease, \nblood creatine increase, blood creatinine \nincrease, haemoglobin decrease, blood urea \nincrease, blood triglycerides increase, blood \ncholesterol increase, haematocritic decrease, \nblood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood \npotassium increase\nRare\nBlood glucose increase, activated partial \nthromboplastin time prolonged, red blood cell \ncount decrease, blood alkaline phosphatase \nincrease, blood creatine phosphokinase increase* \n\n* Adverse reactions coming from post-marketing experience\n** Treatment-emergent non-infective diarrhoea and abnormal liver function tests in the combined \nPhase 3 studies are more frequent in patients concomitantly treated with colchicine.\n*** See section 5.1 for incidences of gout flares in the individual Phase 3 randomized controlled \nstudies.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic \nepidermal necrolysis and anaphylactic reaction/shock, have occurred in the post-marketing experience. \nStevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic epidermal necrolysis are characterised by progressive skin \nrashes associated with blisters or mucosal lesions and eye irritation. Hypersensitivity reactions to \nfebuxostat can be associated to the following symptoms: skin reactions characterised by infiltrated \nmaculopapular eruption, generalised or exfoliative rashes, but also skin lesions, facial oedema, fever, \nhaematologic abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia, and single or multiple organ \ninvolvement (liver and kidney including tubulointerstitial nephritis) (see section 4.4).\n\nGout flares were commonly observed soon after the start of treatment and during the first months. \n\n\n\n26\n\nThereafter, the frequency of gout flare decreases in a time-dependent manner. Gout flare prophylaxis \nis recommended (see section 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nTumor Lysis Syndrome\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn the randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 pivotal FLORENCE (FLO-01) study comparing febuxostat \nwith allopurinol (346 patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies and at \nintermediate-to-high risk of TLS), only 22 (6.4%) patients overall experienced adverse reactions, \nnamely 11 (6.4%) patients in each treatment group. The majority of adverse reactions were either mild \nor moderate.\nOverall, the FLORENCE trial did not highlight any particular safety concern in addition to the \nprevious experience with febuxostat in gout, with the exception of the following three adverse \nreactions (listed above in table 1).\n\nCardiac disorders:\nUncommon: Left bundle branch block, sinus tachycardia\n\nVascular disorders:\nUncommon: haemorrhage\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nPatients with an overdose should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antigout preparations, preparations inhibiting uric acid production; ATC \ncode: M04AA03.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nUric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of \nhypoxanthine \u2192 xanthine \u2192 uric acid. Both steps in the above transformations are catalyzed by \nxanthine oxidase (XO). Febuxostat is a 2-arylthiazole derivative that achieves its therapeutic effect of \ndecreasing serum uric acid by selectively inhibiting XO. Febuxostat is a potent, non-purine selective \ninhibitor of XO (NP-SIXO) with an in vitro inhibition Ki value less than one nanomolar. Febuxostat \nhas been shown to potently inhibit both the oxidized and reduced forms of XO. At therapeutic \nconcentrations febuxostat does not inhibit other enzymes involved in purine or pyrimidine \nmetabolism, namely, guanine deaminase, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, orotate \nphosphoribosyltransferase, orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase or purine nucleoside \nphosphorylase.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nGout\n\n\n\n27\n\nThe efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three Phase 3 pivotal studies (the two pivotal APEX \nand FACT studies, and the additional CONFIRMS study described below) that were conducted in \n4101 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout. In each phase 3 pivotal study, febuxostat demonstrated \nsuperior ability to lower and maintain serum uric acid levels compared to allopurinol. The primary \nefficacy endpoint in the APEX and FACT studies was the proportion of patients whose last 3 monthly \nserum uric acid levels were < 6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L). In the additional phase 3 CONFIRMS study, \nfor which results became available after the marketing authorisation for febuxostat was first issued, the \nprimary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients whose serum urate level was < 6.0 mg/dL at \nthe final visit. No patients with organ transplant have been included in these studies (see section 4.2).\n\nAPEX Study: The Allopurinol and Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Study of Febuxostat (APEX) was a \nPhase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 28-week study. One thousand and seventy-two (1072) \npatients were randomized: placebo (n=134), febxuostat 80 mg QD (n=267), febuxostat 120 mg QD \n(n=269), febuxostat 240 mg QD (n=134) or allopurinol (300 mg QD [n=258] for patients with a \nbaseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg QD [n=10] for patients with a baseline serum \ncreatinine >1.5 mg/dL and \u22642.0 mg/dL). Two hundred and forty mg febuxostat (2 times the \nrecommended highest dose) was used as a safety evaluation dose.\n\nThe APEX study showed statistically significant superiority of both the febuxostat 80 mg QD and the \nfebuxostat 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n \n= 258) /100 mg (n = 10) treatment arm in reducing the sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) (see Table 2 \nand Figure 1).\n\nFACT Study: The Febuxostat Allopurinol Controlled Trial (FACT) Study was a Phase 3, randomized, \ndouble-blind, multicenter, 52-week study. Seven hundred sixty (760) patients were randomized: \nfebuxostat 80 mg QD (n=256), febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=251), or allopurinol 300 mg QD (n=253).\n\nThe FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of both febuxostat 80 mg and \nfebuxostat 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 300 mg \ntreatment arm in reducing and maintaining sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L).\n\nTable 2 summarises the primary efficacy endpoint results:\n\nTable 2\nProportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels <6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L)\n\nLast Three Monthly Visits\n\nStudy Febuxostat\n80 mg QD\n\nFebuxostat \n120 mg QD\n\nAllopurinol 300 / \n100 mg QD1\n\nAPEX\n(28 weeks)\n\n48%*\n\n(n=262)\n65%*, #\n\n(n=269)\n22%\n\n(n=268)\nFACT\n\n(52 weeks)\n53%*\n\n(n=255)\n62%*\n\n(n=250)\n21 %\n\n(n=251)\nCombined\n\nResults\n51%*\n\n(n=517)\n63%*, #\n\n(n=519)\n22%\n\n(n=519)\n1results from subjects receiving either 100 mg QD (n=10: patients with serum \ncreatinine >1.5 and \u22642.0 mg/dL) or 300 mg QD (n=509) were pooled for \nanalyses.\n* p < 0.001 vs allopurinol, # p < 0.001 vs 80 mg \n\nThe ability of febuxostat to lower serum uric acid levels was prompt and persistent. Reduction in \nserum uric acid level to <6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) was noted by the Week 2 visit and was maintained \nthroughout treatment. The mean serum uric acid levels over time for each treatment group from the \ntwo pivotal Phase 3 studies are shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n28\n\nFigure 1 Mean Serum Uric Acid Levels in Combined Pivotal Phase 3 Studies\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nBL 2 4 6 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52\n\nM\nea\n\nn\n (\n\n\u00b1\nS\n\nE\nM\n\n) \nS\n\ner\num\n\n U\nri\n\nc \nA\n\nci\nd \n\nL\nev\n\nel\n (\n\nm\ng/\n\nd\nL\n\n)\n\nWeek\n\nFebuxostat 80 mg\n\nAllopurinol \n\nPlacebo\n\nFebuxostat 120 mg\n\nFebuxostat 240 mg\n\nBL=baseline      SEM=standard error of the mean\n\nNote: 509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg QD; 10 patients with serum creatinine >1.5 and \n\u22642.0 mg/dL were dosed with 100 mg QD. (10 patients out of 268 in APEX study).\n240 mg febuxostat was used to evaluate the safety of febuxostat at twice the recommended \nhighest dose.\n\nCONFIRMS Study: The CONFIRMS study was a Phase 3, randomized, controlled, 26-week study to \nevaluate the safety and efficacy of febuxostat 40 mg and 80 mg, in comparison with allopurinol \n300 mg or 200 mg, in patients with gout and hyperuricaemia. Two thousand and two hundred-sixty \nnine (2269) patients were randomized: febuxostat 40 mg QD (n=757), febuxostat 80 mg QD (n=756), \nor allopurinol 300/200 mg QD (n=756). At least 65% of the patients had mild-moderate renal \nimpairment (with creatinine clearance of 30-89 mL/min). Prophylaxis against gout flares was \nobligatory over the 26-week period.\nThe proportion of patients with serum urate levels of < 6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) at the final visit, was \n45% for 40 mg febuxostat, 67% for febuxostat 80 mg and 42% for allopurinol 300/200 mg, \nrespectively.\n\nPrimary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with renal impairment\nThe APEX Study evaluated efficacy in 40 patients with renal impairment (i.e., baseline serum \ncreatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642.0 mg/dL). For renally impaired subjects who were randomized to \nallopurinol, the dose was capped at 100 mg QD. Febuxostat achieved the primary efficacy endpoint in \n44% (80 mg QD), 45% (120 mg QD), and 60% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 0% in the \nallopurinol 100 mg QD and placebo groups.\n\nThere were no clinically significant differences in the percent decrease in serum uric acid \nconcentration in healthy subjects irrespective of their renal function (58% in the normal renal function \ngroup and 55% in the severe renal dysfunction group).\n\nAn analysis in patients with gout and renal impairment was prospectively defined in the CONFIRMS \nstudy, and showed that febuxostat was significantly more efficacious in lowering serum urate levels to \n< 6 mg/dL compared to allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg in patients who had gout with mild to moderate \nrenal impairment (65% of patients studied).\n\nPrimary endpoint in the sub group of patients with sUA \u2265 10 mg/dL\nApproximately 40% of patients (combined APEX and FACT) had a baseline sUA of \u2265 10 mg/dL. In \nthis subgroup febuxostat achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < 6.0 mg/dL at the last 3 visits) \n\n\n\n29\n\nin 41% (80 mg QD), 48% (120 mg QD), and 66% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 9% in the \nallopurinol 300 mg/100 mg QD and 0 % in the placebo groups.\n\nIn the CONFIRMS study, the proportion of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < \n6.0 mg/dL at the final visit) for patients with a baseline serum urate level of \u2265 10 mg/dL treated with \nfebuxostat 40 mg QD was 27% (66/249), with febuxostat 80 mg QD 49% (125/254) and with \nallopurinol 300 mg/200 mg QD 31% (72/230), respectively.\n\nClinical Outcomes: proportion of patients requiring treatment for a gout flare\nAPEX study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the febuxostat \n120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for gout flare compared to febuxostat 80 mg (28%), \nallopurinol 300 mg (23%) and placebo (20%). Flares increased following the prophylaxis period and \ngradually decreased over time. Between 46% and 55% of subjects received treatment for gout flares \nfrom Week 8 and Week 28. Gout flares during the last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 24-28) were \nobserved in 15% (febuxostat 80, 120 mg), 14% (allopurinol 300 mg) and 20% (placebo) of subjects.\n\nFACT study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the febuxostat \n120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for a gout flare compared to both the febuxostat \n80 mg (22%) and allopurinol 300 mg (21%) treatment groups. After the 8-week prophylaxis period, \nthe incidences of flares increased and gradually decreased over time (64% and 70% of subjects \nreceived treatment for gout flares from Week 8-52). Gout flares during the last 4 weeks of the study \n(Weeks 49-52) were observed in 6-8% (febuxostat 80 mg, 120 mg) and 11% (allopurinol 300 mg) of \nsubjects.\n\nThe proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare (APEX and FACT Study) was \nnumerically lower in the groups that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate level <6.0 mg/dL, \n<5.0 mg/dL, or <4.0 mg/dL compared to the group that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate \nlevel \u22656.0 mg/dL during the last 32 weeks of the treatment period (Week 20-Week 24 to Week 49 - 52 \nintervals).\n\nDuring the CONFIRMS study, the percentages of patients who required treatment for gout flares (Day \n1 through Month 6) were 31% and 25% for the febuxostat 80 mg and allopurinol groups, respectively. \nNo difference in the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares was observed between \nthe febuxostat 80 mg and 40 mg groups.\n\nLong-term, open label extension studies\nEXCEL Study (C02-021): The Excel study was a three years Phase 3, open label, multicenter, \nrandomised, allopurinol-controlled, safety extension study for patients who had completed the pivotal \nPhase 3 studies (APEX or FACT). A total of 1,086 patients were enrolled: febuxostat 80 mg QD \n(n=649), febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=292) and allopurinol 300/100 mg QD (n=145). About 69 % of \npatients required no treatment change to achieve a final stable treatment. Patients who had 3 \nconsecutive sUA levels >6.0 mg/dL were withdrawn.\nSerum urate levels were maintained over time (i.e. 91% and 93% of patients on initial treatment with \nfebuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg, respectively, had sUA <6 mg/dL at Month 36).\nThree years data showed a decrease in the incidence of gout flares with less than 4% of patients \nrequiring treatment for a flare (i.e. more than 96% of patients did not require treatment for a flare) at \nMonth 16-24 and at Month 30-36.\n\n46% and 38%, of patients on final stable treatment of febuxostat 80 or 120 mg QD, respectively, had \ncomplete resolution of the primary palpable tophus from baseline to the Final Visit.\n\nFOCUS Study (TMX-01-005) was a 5 years Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, safety extension study \nfor patients who had completed the febuxostat 4 weeks of double blind dosing in study TMX-00-004.\n\n116 patients were enrolled and received initially febuxostat 80 mg QD. 62% of patients required no \ndose adjustment to maintain sUA <6 mg/dL and 38% of patients required a dose adjustment to achieve \na final stable dose.\n\n\n\n30\n\nThe proportion of patients with serum urate levels of <6.0 mg/dL (357 \u03bcmol/L) at the final visit was \ngreater than 80% (81-100%) at each febuxostat dose.\n\nDuring the phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in patients \ntreated with febuxostat (5.0%). These rates were similar to the rates reported on allopurinol (4.2%) \n(see section 4.4). Increased TSH values (>5.5 \u03bcIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term \ntreatment with febuxostat (5.5%) and patients with allopurinol (5.8%) in the long term open label \nextension studies (see section 4.4).\n\nPost Marketing long term studies\nCARES Study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, non inferiority trial comparing CV \noutcomes with febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout and a history of major CV \ndisease including MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary or cerebral revascularization \nprocedure, stroke, hospitalized transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes \nmellitus with evidence of microvascular or macrovascular disease. To achieve sUA less than 6 \nmg/dL, the dose of febuxostat was titrated from 40 mg up to 80 mg (regardless of renal \nfunction) and the dose of allopurinol was titrated in 100 mg increments from 300 to 600 mg in \npatients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment and from 200 to 400 mg in \npatients with moderate renal impairment.\nThe primary endpoint in CARES was the time to first occurrence of MACE, a composite of non-fatal \nMI, non-fatal stroke, CV death and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization.\nThe endpoints (primary and secondary) were analysed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) \nanalysis including all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind \nstudy medication.\nOverall 56.6% of patients discontinued trial treatment prematurely and 45% of patients did not \ncomplete all trial visits.\nIn total, 6,190 patients were followed for a median of 32 months and the median duration of exposure \nwas 728 days for patients in febuxostat group (n 3098) and 719 days in allopurinol group (n 3092).\nThe primary MACE endpoint occurred at similar rates in the febuxostat and allopurinol treatment \ngroups (10.8% vs. 10.4% of patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; two-sided repeated 95%\nconfidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.23).\nIn the analysis of the individual components of MACE, the rate of CV deaths was higher with \nfebuxostat than allopurinol (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73). The rates of the \nother MACE events were similar in the febuxostat and allopurinol groups, i.e. non-fatal MI (3.6% vs. \n3.8% of patients; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.72-1.21), non-fatal stroke (2.3% vs. 2.3% of patients; HR 1.01; \n95% CI 0.73-1.41) and urgent revascularization due to unstable angina (1.6% vs. 1.8% of patients; \nHR 0.86; 95% CI 0.59-1.26).  The rate of all-cause mortality was also higher with febuxostat than \nallopurinol (7.8% vs. 6.4% of patients; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47), which was mainly driven by the \nhigher rate of CV deaths in that group (see section 4.4).\nRates of adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure, hospital admissions for arrhythmias not \nassociated with ischemia, venous thromboembolic events and hospitalization for transient ischemic \nattacks were comparable for febuxostat and allopurinol.\n\nTumor Lysis Syndrome\n\nThe efficacy and safety of febuxostat in the prevention and treatment of Tumor Lysis Syndrome was \nevaluated in the FLORENCE (FLO-01) study. Febuxostat showed a superior and faster urate lowering \nactivity compared to allopurinol.\nFLORENCE was a randomized (1:1), double blind, phase III, pivotal trial comparing febuxostat \n120 mg once daily with allopurinol 200 to 600 mg daily (mean allopurinol daily dose [\u00b1 standard \ndeviation]: 349.7 \u00b1 112.90 mg) in terms of control of serum uric acid level. Eligible patients had to be \ncandidates for allopurinol treatment or have no access to rasburicase. Primary endpoints were serum \nuric acid area under the curve (AUCsUA1-8) and change in serum creatinine (sC) level both from \nbaseline to Day 8.\nOverall, 346 patients with haematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and at intermediate \n\n\n\n31\n\n/ high risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome were included. Mean AUC sUA1-8 (mgxh/dl) was significantly \nlower with febuxostat (514.0 \u00b1 225.71 vs 708.0 \u00b1 234.42; least square means difference: -196.794 \n[95% confidence interval: -238.600; -154.988]; p <.0001). Furthermore, the mean serum uric acid \nlevel was significantly lower with febuxostat since the first 24 hours of treatment and at any following \ntime point. No significant difference in mean serum creatinine change (%) occurred between \nfebuxostat and allopurinol (-0.83 \u00b1 26.98 vs -4.92 \u00b1 16.70 respectively; least square means difference: \n4.0970 [95% confidence interval: -0.6467; 8.8406]; p=0.0903). With regard to secondary endpoints, \nno significant difference was detected in terms of incidence of laboratory TLS (8.1% and 9.2% in \nfebuxostat and allopurinol arm, respectively; relative risk: 0.875 [95% confidence interval: 0.4408; \n1.7369]; p=0.8488) nor of clinical TLS (1.7% and 1.2% in febuxostat and allopurinol arm, \nrespectively; relative risk: 0.994 [95% confidence interval: 0.9691; 1.0199]; p=1.0000). Incidence of \noverall treatment-emergent signs and symptoms and adverse drug reactions was 67.6% vs 64.7% and \n6.4% vs 6.4% with febuxostat and allopurinol respectively. In the FLORENCE study febuxostat \ndemonstrated a superior control of serum uric acid level compared to allopurinol in patients scheduled \nto receive the latter drug. No data comparing febuxostat with rasburicase are currently available.\nThe efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been established in patients with acute severe TLS, e.g. \nin patients who failed on other urate lowering therapies.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nIn healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration \ntime curve (AUC) of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple \ndoses of 10 mg to 120 mg. For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a greater than dose proportional \nincrease in AUC is observed for febuxostat. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of \n10 mg to 240 mg are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal \nelimination half-life (t1/2) of approximately 5 to 8 hours.\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted in 211 patients with \nhyperuricaemia and gout, treated with febuxostat 40-240 mg QD. In general, febuxostat \npharmacokinetic parameters estimated by these analyses are consistent with those obtained from \nhealthy subjects, indicating that healthy subjects are representative for \npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment in the patient population with gout.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFebuxostat is rapidly (tmax of 1.0-1.5 h) and well absorbed (at least 84%). After single or multiple oral \n80 and 120 mg once daily doses, Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 \u03bcg/mL, and 5.0-5.3 \u03bcg/mL, \nrespectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet formulation has not been studied.\n\nFollowing multiple oral 80 mg once daily doses or a single 120 mg dose with a high fat meal, there \nwas a 49% and 38% decrease in Cmax and a 18% and 16% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no \nclinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed \nwhere tested (80 mg multiple dose). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 L after oral \ndoses of 10-300 mg. The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to \nalbumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 80 and 120 mg doses. Plasma \nprotein binding of the active metabolites ranges from about 82% to 91%.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nFebuxostat is extensively metabolized by conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase \n(UDPGT) enzyme system and oxidation via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Four \npharmacologically active hydroxyl metabolites have been identified, of which three occur in plasma of \nhumans. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that those oxidative metabolites were \n\n\n\n32\n\nformed primarily by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 and febuxostat glucuronide was \nformed mainly by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9.\n\nElimination\n\nFebuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14C-\nlabeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat \n(3%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their \nconjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, \napproximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the \nacyl glucuronide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates\n(25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%).\n\nRenal impairment\n\nFollowing multiple doses of 80 mg of febuxostat in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment, the Cmax of febuxostat did not change, relative to subjects with normal renal function. The \nmean total AUC of febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8-fold from 7.5 \u03bcg\u22c5h/mL in the normal \nrenal function group to 13.2 \u03bcg.h/mL in the severe renal dysfunction group. The Cmax and AUC of \nactive metabolites increased up to 2- and 4-fold, respectively. However, no dose adjustment is \nnecessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nFollowing multiple doses of 80 mg of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or \nmoderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the Cmax and AUC of febuxostat and its \nmetabolites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. No \nstudies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\n\nAge\n\nThere were no significant changes observed in AUC of febuxostat or its metabolites following \nmultiple oral doses of febuxostat in elderly as compared to younger healthy subjects.\n\nGender\n\nFollowing multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the Cmax and AUC were 24% and 12% higher in females \nthan in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar between the \ngenders. No dose adjustment is needed based on gender.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were generally observed at exposures in excess of the maximum human \nexposure.\n\nPharmacokinetic modelling and simulation of rat data suggests that, when co-administered with \nfebuxostat, the clinical dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to 20% or less of the \npreviously prescribed dose in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see section 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility\n\nIn male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell papilloma \nand carcinoma) was found only in association with xanthine calculi in the high dose group, at \napproximately 11 times human exposure. There was no significant increase in any other tumour type \nin either male or female mice or rats. These findings are considered a consequence of species specific \npurine metabolism and urine composition and of no relevance to clinical use.\n\n\n\n33\n\nA standard battery of test for genotoxicity did not reveal any biologically relevant genotoxic effects \nfor febuxostat.\n\nFebuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive \nperformance of male and female rats.\n\nThere was no evidence of impaired fertility, teratogenic effects, or harm to the foetus due to \nfebuxostat. There was high dose maternal toxicity accompanied by a reduction in weaning index and \nreduced development of offspring in rats at approximately 4.3 times human exposure. Teratology \nstudies, performed in pregnant rats at approximately 4.3 times and pregnant rabbits at approximately \n13 times human exposure did not reveal any teratogenic effects.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Febuxostat Krka is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Febuxostat Krka\n3. How to take Febuxostat Krka\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Febuxostat Krka\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Febuxostat Krka is and what it is used for\n\nFebuxostat Krka tablets contain the active substance febuxostat and are used to treat gout, which is \nassociated with an excess of a chemical called uric acid (urate) in the body. In some people, the \namount of uric acid builds up in the blood and may become too high to remain soluble. When this \nhappens, urate crystals may form in and around the joints and kidneys. These crystals can cause \nsudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint (known as a gout attack). Left untreated, \nlarger deposits called tophi may form in and around joints. These tophi may cause joint and bone \ndamage.\n\nFebuxostat Krka works by reducing uric acid levels. Keeping uric acid levels low by taking Febuxostat \nKrka once every day stops crystals building up, and over time it reduces symptoms. Keeping uric acid \nlevels sufficiently low for a long enough period can also shrink tophi.\n\nFebuxostat Krka 120 mg tablets are also used to treat and prevent high blood levels of uric acid that \nmay occur when you start to receive chemotherapy for blood cancers.\nWhen chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, and uric acid levels increase in the blood \naccordingly, unless the formation of uric acid is prevented.\n\nFebuxostat Krka is for adults.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Febuxostat Krka\n\nDo not take Febuxostat Krka\n- if you are allergic to febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Febuxostat Krka:\n- if you have or have had heart failure or heart problems or stroke,\n- if you have or have had kidney disease and/or serious allergic reaction to Allopurinol (a \n\nmedicine used for the treatment of gout),\n\n\n\n47\n\n- if you have or have had liver disease or liver function test abnormalities,\n- if you are being treated for high uric acid levels as a result of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare \n\ninherited condition in which there is too much uric acid in the blood),\n- if you have thyroid problems.\n\nShould you experience allergic reactions to Febuxostat Krka, stop taking this medicine (see also \nsection 4). Possible symptoms of allergic reactions might be:\n- rash including severe forms (e.g. blisters, nodules, itchy, exfoliative rash), itchiness\n- swelling of limbs or face\n- difficulties in breathing\n- fever with enlarged lymph nodes\n- but also serious life threatening allergic conditions with cardiac and circulatory arrest.\nYour doctor might decide to permanently stop treatment with Febuxostat Krka.\n\nThere have been rare reports of potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) \nwith the use of febuxostat, appearing initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with \ncentral blister on the trunk. It may also include ulcers in the mouth, throat, nose, genitals and \nconjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). The rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the \nskin.\nIf you have developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome with the use of febuxostat, you must not be \nre-started on Febuxostat Krka at any time. If you develop a rash or these skin symptoms, seek \nimmediate advice from a doctor and tell that you are taking this medicine.\n\nIf you are having a gout attack at the moment (a sudden onset of severe pain, tenderness, redness, \nwarmth and swelling in a joint), wait for the gout attack to subside before first starting treatment with \nFebuxostat Krka.\n\nFor some people, gout attacks may flare up when starting certain medicines that control uric acid \nlevels. Not everyone gets flares, but you could get a flare-up even if you are taking Febuxostat Krka, \nand especially during the first weeks or months of treatment. It is important to keep taking Febuxostat \nKrka even if you have a flare, as Febuxostat Krka is still working to lower uric acid. Over time, gout \nflares will occur less often and be less painful if you keep taking Febuxostat Krka every day.\n\nYour doctor will often prescribe other medicines, if they are needed, to help prevent or treat the \nsymptoms of flares (such as pain and swelling in a joint).\n\nIn patients with very high urate levels (e.g. those undergoing cancer chemotherapy), treatment with \nuric acid-lowering medicines could lead to the build-up of xanthine in the urinary tract, with possible \nstones, even though this has not been observed in patients being treated with febuxostat for Tumor \nLysis Syndrome.\n\nYour doctor may ask you to have blood tests to check that your liver is working normally.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 18 because the safety and efficacy have not \nbeen established.\n\nOther medicines and Febuxostat Krka\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\nIt is especially important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines containing any \nof the following substances as they may interact with Febuxostat Krka and your doctor may wish to \nconsider necessary measures:\n- Mercaptopurine (used to treat cancer)\n- Azathioprine (used to reduce immune response)\n- Theophylline (used to treat asthma)\n\n\n\n48\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nIt is not known if Febuxostat Krka may harm your unborn child. Febuxostat Krka should not be used \nduring pregnancy. It is not known if Febuxostat Krka may pass into human breast milk. You should \nnot take Febuxostat Krka if you are breast feeding, or if you are planning to breastfeed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nBe aware that you may experience dizziness, sleepiness, blurred vision and numbness or tingling \nsensation during treatment with this medicine and should not drive or operate machines if affected.\n\nFebuxostat Krka contains lactose and sodium\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor\nbefore taking this medicinal product.\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019.\n\n3. How to take Febuxostat Krka\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\n- The usual dose is one tablet daily.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what febuxostat krka is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "febuxostat krka tablets contain the active substance febuxostat and are used to treat gout, which is associated with an excess of a chemical called uric acid (urate) in the body. in some people, the amount of uric acid builds up in the blood and may become too high to remain soluble. when this happens, urate crystals may form in and around the joints and kidneys. these crystals can cause sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint (known as a gout attack). left untreated, larger deposits called tophi may form in and around joints. these tophi may cause joint and bone damage. febuxostat krka works by reducing uric acid levels. keeping uric acid levels low by taking febuxostat krka once every day stops crystals building up, and over time it reduces symptoms. keeping uric acid levels sufficiently low for a long enough period can also shrink tophi. febuxostat krka 120 mg tablets are also used to treat and prevent high blood levels of uric acid that may occur when you start to receive chemotherapy for blood cancers. when chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, and uric acid levels increase in the blood accordingly, unless the formation of uric acid is prevented. febuxostat krka is for adults.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

not take febuxostat krka - if you are allergic to febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking febuxostat krka: - if you have or have had heart failure or heart problems or stroke, - if you have or have had kidney disease and/or serious allergic reaction to allopurinol (a medicine used for the treatment of gout), 47 - if you have or have had liver disease or liver function test abnormalities, - if you are being treated for high uric acid levels as a result of lesch-nyhan syndrome (a rare inherited condition in which there is too much uric acid in the blood), - if you have thyroid problems. should you experience allergic reactions to febuxostat krka, stop taking this medicine (see also section 4). possible symptoms of allergic reactions might be: - rash including severe forms (e.g. blisters, nodules, itchy, exfoliative rash), itchiness - swelling of limbs or face - difficulties in breathing - fever with enlarged lymph nodes - but also serious life threatening allergic conditions with cardiac and circulatory arrest. your doctor might decide to permanently stop treatment with febuxostat krka. there have been rare reports of potentially life-threatening skin rashes (stevens-johnson syndrome) with the use of febuxostat, appearing initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blister on the trunk. it may also include ulcers in the mouth, throat, nose, genitals and conjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). the rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the skin. if you have developed stevens-johnson syndrome with the use of febuxostat, you must not be re-started on febuxostat krka at any time. if you develop a rash or these skin symptoms, seek immediate advice from a doctor and tell that you are taking this medicine. if you are having a gout attack at the moment (a sudden onset of severe pain, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint), wait for the gout attack to subside before first starting treatment with febuxostat krka. for some people, gout attacks may flare up when starting certain medicines that control uric acid levels. not everyone gets flares, but you could get a flare-up even if you are taking febuxostat krka, and especially during the first weeks or months of treatment. it is important to keep taking febuxostat krka even if you have a flare, as febuxostat krka is still working to lower uric acid. over time, gout flares will occur less often and be less painful if you keep taking febuxostat krka every day. your doctor will often prescribe other medicines, if they are needed, to help prevent or treat the symptoms of flares (such as pain and swelling in a joint). in patients with very high urate levels (e.g. those undergoing cancer chemotherapy), treatment with uric acid-lowering medicines could lead to the build-up of xanthine in the urinary tract, with possible stones, even though this has not been observed in patients being treated with febuxostat for tumor lysis syndrome. your doctor may ask you to have blood tests to check that your liver is working normally. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children under the age of 18 because the safety and efficacy have not been established. other medicines and febuxostat krka tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. it is especially important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines containing any of the following substances as they may interact with febuxostat krka and your doctor may wish to consider necessary measures: - mercaptopurine (used to treat cancer) - azathioprine (used to reduce immune response) - theophylline (used to treat asthma) 48 pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. it is not known if febuxostat krka may harm your unborn child. febuxostat krka should not be used during pregnancy. it is not known if febuxostat krka may pass into human breast milk. you should not take febuxostat krka if you are breast feeding, or if you are planning to breastfeed. driving and using machines be aware that you may experience dizziness, sleepiness, blurred vision and numbness or tingling sensation during treatment with this medicine and should not drive or operate machines if affected. febuxostat krka contains lactose and sodium if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium- free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "febuxostat krka", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,
