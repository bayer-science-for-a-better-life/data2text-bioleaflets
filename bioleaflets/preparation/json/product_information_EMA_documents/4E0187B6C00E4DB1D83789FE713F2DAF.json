NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKivexa 600 mg/300 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 600 mg of abacavir (as sulfate) and 300 mg lamivudine. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: sunset yellow FCF (E110) 1.7 mg per tablet \n \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nOrange, film-coated, modified capsule shaped tablets, debossed with GS FC2 on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKivexa is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults, adolescents and children weighing at least 25 kg \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nBefore initiating treatment with abacavir, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be \nperformed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin (see section 4.4). Abacavir should \nnot be used in patients known to carry the HLA-B*5701 allele. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be prescribed by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults, adolescents and children weighing at least 25 kg: \n \nThe recommended dose of Kivexa is one tablet once daily. \n \nChildren Under 25 kg:  \nKivexa should not be administered to children who weigh less than 25 kg because it is a fixed-dose \ntablet that cannot be dose reduced.  \n \nKivexa is a fixed-dose tablet and should not be prescribed for patients requiring dose adjustments. \nSeparate preparations of abacavir or lamivudine are available in cases where discontinuation or dose \nadjustment of one of the active substances is indicated. In these cases the physician should refer to the \nindividual product information for these medicinal products. \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nElderly:  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are currently available in patients over 65 years of age. Special care is \nadvised in this age group due to age associated changes such as the decrease in renal function and \nalteration of haematological parameters. \n \nRenal impairment:  \nKivexa is not recommended for use in patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min as necessary \ndose adjustment cannot be made (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment:  \nAbacavir is primarily metabolised by the liver. No clinical data are available in patients with moderate \nor severe hepatic impairment, therefore the use of Kivexa is not recommended unless judged necessary. \nIn patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6) close monitoring is required, including  \nmonitoring of abacavir plasma levels if feasible (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population:  \nThe safety and efficacy of Kivexa in children weighing less than 25 kg has not been established.  \n \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on posology \ncan be made. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use \n \nKivexa can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. See sections \n4.4 and 4.8. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe special warnings and precautions relevant to abacavir and lamivudine are included in this section. \nThere are no additional precautions and warnings relevant to Kivexa. \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the \nrisk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.   \n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions (see also section 4.8 ) \n \nAbacavir is associated with a risk for hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) (see section4.8) ) characterised \nby fever and/or rash with other symptoms indicating multi-organ involvement. HSRs have been \nobserved with abacavir, some of which have been life-threatening, and in rare cases fatal, when not \nmanaged appropriately. \n \nThe risk for abacavir HSR to occur is high for patients who test positive for the HLA-B*5701 allele. \nHowever, abacavir HSRs have been reported at a lower frequency in patients who do not carry this \nallele.   \n \n\nTherefore the following should be adhered to: \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• HLA-B*5701 status must always be documented prior to initiating therapy. \n\n• Kivexa should never be initiated in patients with a positive HLA-B*5701 status, nor in patients \nwith a negative HLA-B*5701 status who had a suspected abacavir HSR on a previous abacavir-\ncontaining regimen. (e.g. Ziagen, Trizivir, Triumeq)  \n\n• Kivexa must be stopped without delay, even in the absence of the HLA-B*5701 allele, if an \nHSR is suspected. Delay in stopping treatment with Kivexa after the onset of hypersensitivity \nmay result in a life-threatening reaction.  \n\n• After stopping treatment with Kivexa for reasons of a suspected HSR, Kivexa or any other \nmedicinal product containing abacavir (e.g. Ziagen, Trizivir, Triumeq) must never be re-\ninitiated.  \n\n• Restarting abacavir containing products following a suspected abacavir HSR can result in a \nprompt return of symptoms within hours. This recurrence is usually more severe than on initial \npresentation, and may include life-threatening hypotension and death. \n\n• In order to avoid restarting abacavir, patients who have experienced a suspected HSR should be \ninstructed to dispose of their remaining Kivexa tablets  \n\n \n• Clinical Description of abacavir HSR \n \nAbacavir HSR has been well characterised through clinical studies and during post marketing follow-up. \nSymptoms usually appeared within the first six weeks (median time to onset 11 days) of initiation of \ntreatment with abacavir, although these reactions may occur at any time during therapy. \n \nAlmost all HSR to abacavir include fever and/or rash. Other signs and symptoms that have been \nobserved as part of abacavir HSR are described in detail in section 4.8 (Description of selected adverse \nreactions), including respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Importantly, such symptoms may lead \nto misdiagnosis of HSR as respiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis), or \ngastroenteritis. \n \nThe symptoms related to HSR worsen with continued therapy and can be life-threatening. These \nsymptoms usually resolve upon discontinuation of abacavir.  \nRarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of HSR have also \nexperienced life-threatening reactions within hours of re- initiating abacavir therapy (see Section 4.8 \nDescription of selected adverse reactions).  Restarting abacavir in such patients must be done in a \nsetting where medical assistance is readily available. \n\n \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. \nSuch changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases \nevidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any \nparticular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV \ntreatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n\n \nPancreatitis  \n \nPancreatitis has been reported, but a causal relationship to lamivudine and abacavir is uncertain. \n \nRisk of virological failure  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n- Triple nucleoside therapy: There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure, and of \nemergence of resistance at an early stage when abacavir and lamivudine were combined with tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate as a once daily regimen. \n- The risk of virological failure with Kivexa might be higher than with other therapeutic options (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nLiver disease  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Kivexa has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver \ndisorders. Kivexa is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy, and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.  \n \nPatients co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C virus \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral \ntherapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal \nproducts.  \n \nIf lamivudine is being used concomitantly for the treatment of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV), \nadditional information relating to the use of lamivudine in the treatment of hepatitis B infection can be \nfound in the Summary of Product Characteristics for  products containing lamivudine that are indicated \nfor the treatment of HBV. \n \nIf Kivexa is discontinued in patients co-infected with HBV, periodic monitoring of both liver function \ntests and markers of HBV replication is recommended, as withdrawal of lamivudine may result in an \nacute exacerbation of hepatitis (see the Summary of Product Characteristics for products containing \nlamivudine that are indicated for the treatment of HBV). \n \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleoside and nucleotide  analogues  may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which \nis most pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine .There have been reports of \nmitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside \nanalogues: these have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.The \nmain adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic \ndisorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These reactions have  often been transitory. Late onset \nneurological disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). \nWhether such  neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings \nshould be considered for any child exposed in utero to  nucleotide and nucleotide  analogues, who \npresents with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.. These \nfindings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant \nwomen to prevent vertical transmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such \nreactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \n\n\n\n6 \n\nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and \nPneumocystis  jirovecii pneumonia (often referred to as PCP). Any inflammatory symptoms should be \nevaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and \nautoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, \nthe reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis  \n \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness \nor difficulty in movement. \n \n \nOpportunistic infections  \n \nPatients should be advised that Kivexa or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection \nand that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. \nTherefore patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the \ntreatment of these associated HIV diseases. \n\nMyocardial infarction  \n\nObservational studies have shown an association between myocardial infarction and the use of \nabacavir. Those studied were mainly antiretroviral experienced patients. Data from clinical trials \nshowed limited numbers of myocardial infarction and could not exclude a small increase in risk.  \nOverall the available data from observational cohorts and from randomised trials show some \ninconsistency so can neither confirm nor refute a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and \nthe risk of myocardial infarction.  To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a \npotential increase in risk.  When prescribing Kivexa, action should be taken to try to minimize all \nmodifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). \n\nDrug Interactions: \n\nKivexa should not be taken with any other medicinal products containing lamivudine or medicinal \nproducts containing emtricitabine. \n \nThe combination of lamivudine with cladribine is not-recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nExcipients \n \nKivexa contains the azo colouring agent sunset yellow, which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nKivexa contains abacavir and lamivudine, therefore any interactions identified for these individually \nare relevant to Kivexa. Clinical studies have shown that there are no clinically significant interactions \nbetween abacavir and lamivudine. \n \nAbacavir is metabolised by UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) enzymes and alcohol dehydrogenase; \nco-administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT enzymes or with compounds eliminated through \nalcohol dehydrogenase could alter abacavir exposure. Lamivudine is cleared renally. Active renal \n\n\n\n7 \n\nsecretion of lamivudine in the urine is mediated through organic cation transporters (OCTs); \nco-administration of lamivudine with OCT inhibitors may increase lamivudine exposure.  \n \nAbacavir and lamivudine are not significantly metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (such as CYP \n3A4, CYP 2C9 or CYP 2D6) nor do they inhibit or induce this enzyme system. Therefore, there is little \npotential for interactions with antiretroviral protease inhibitors, non-nucleosides and other medicinal \nproducts metabolised by major P450 enzymes.  \n \nKivexa should not be taken with any other medicinal products containing lamivudine (see section 4.4). \n \nThe list below should not be considered exhaustive but is representative of the classes studied. \n \n \n\nDrugs by Therapeutic Area \n \n\nInteraction \nGeometric mean change (%) \n(Possible mechanism) \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration \n\nANTIRETROVIRAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS \nDidanosine /Abacavir Interaction not studied.

Animal studies with lamivudine showed an increase in early embryonic deaths in rabbits but \nnot in rats. (see section 5.3). The active ingredients of Kivexa may inhibit cellular DNA replication and \nabacavir has been shown to be carcinogenic in animal models (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance \nof these findings is unknown. Placental transfer of abacavir and lamivudine has been shown to occur in \nhumans.  \n \nIn pregnant women treated with abacavir, more than 800 outcomes after first trimester exposure and \nmore than 1000 outcomes after second and third trimester exposure indicate no malformative and \nfoetal/neonatal effect. In pregnant women treated with lamivudine, more than 1000 outcomes from first \ntrimester and more than 1000 outcomes from second and third trimester exposure indicate no \nmalformative and foeto/neonatal effect. There are no data on the use of Kivexa in pregnancy, however \nthe malformative risk is unlikely in humans based on those data. \n \nFor patients co-infected with hepatitis who are being treated with a lamivudine containing medicinal \nproduct such as Kivexa and subsequently become pregnant, consideration should be given to the \npossibility of a recurrence of hepatitis on discontinuation of lamivudine.  \n \n\nDrugs by Therapeutic Area \n \n\nInteraction \nGeometric mean change (%) \n(Possible mechanism) \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration \n\nMISCELLANEOUS \nEthanol/Abacavir \n(0.7 g/kg single dose/600 mg \nsingle dose) \n\nAbacavir: AUC ↑41% \nEthanol: AUC ↔ \n \n(Inhibition of alcohol \ndehydrogenase) \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\nEthanol/Lamivudine Interaction not studied. \nSorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, \n13.4 g)/ Lamivudine \n\nSingle dose lamivudine oral \nsolution 300 mg  \n\nLamivudine: \n\nAUC ↓ 14%; 32%; 36%  \n\nCmax ↓ 28%; 52%, 55%. \n\nWhen possible, avoid chronic \ncoadministration of Kivexa \nwith medicinal products \ncontaining sorbitol or other \nosmotic acting poly-alcohols \nor monosaccharide alcohols \n(e.g. xylitol, mannitol, lactitol, \nmaltitol). Consider more \nfrequent monitoring of HIV-1 \nviral load when chronic \ncoadministration cannot be \navoided. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nMitochondrial dysfunction  \nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable \ndegree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-\nnegative infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAbacavir and its metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Abacavir is also excreted into \nhuman milk.  \n \nBased on more than 200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum concentrations of lamivudine in \nbreastfed infants of mothers treated for HIV are very low (< 4% of maternal serum concentrations) and \nprogressively decrease to undetectable levels when breastfed infants reach 24 weeks of age. There are \nno data available on the safety of abacavir and lamivudine when administered to babies less than three \nmonths old.  \n \nIt is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances \nin order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in animals showed that neither abacavir nor lamivudine had any effect on fertility (see section \n5.3).   \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The clinical status \nof the patient and the adverse reaction profile of Kivexa should be borne in mind when considering the \npatient’s ability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n4.8    Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe adverse reactions reported for Kivexa were consistent with the known safety profiles of abacavir \nand lamivudine when given as separate medicinal products. For many of these adverse reactions it is \nunclear whether they are related to the active substance, the wide range of other medicinal products \nused in the management of HIV infection, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease \nprocess. \nMany of the adverse reactions listed in the table below occur commonly (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nfever, lethargy, rash) in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity. Therefore, patients with any of these \nsymptoms should be carefully evaluated for the presence of this hypersensitivity (see section 4.4). Very \nrarely cases of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have \nbeen reported where abacavir hypersensitivity could not be ruled out. In such cases medicinal products \ncontaining abacavir should be permanently discontinued. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to abacavir or lamivudine are listed by body \nsystem, organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (> 1/10), \ncommon (> 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (> 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (> 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000). \n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nBody system Abacavir Lamivudine \n \n\nBlood and lymphatic systems \ndisorders \n \n\n Uncommon: Neutropenia and \nanaemia (both occasionally \nsevere), thrombocytopenia \nVery rare: Pure red cell aplasia \n \n\nImmune system disorders Common: hypersensitivity \n \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n \n\nCommon: anorexia \nVery rare: lactic acidosis \n\nVery rare: lactic acidosis \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nCommon: headache Common: Headache, insomnia. \nVery rare: Cases of peripheral \nneuropathy (or paraesthesia) \nhave been reported \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n \n\n Common: Cough, nasal \nsymptoms \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\nCommon: nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea  \nRare: pancreatitis has been \nreported, but a causal \nrelationship to abacavir \ntreatment is uncertain \n\nCommon: Nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain or cramps, \ndiarrhoea \nRare: Rises in serum amylase. \nCases of pancreatitis have been \nreported \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n \n\n Uncommon: Transient rises in \nliver enzymes (AST, ALT),  \nRare: Hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\nCommon: rash (without \nsystemic symptoms) \nVery rare: erythema \nmultiforme, Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome and toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n\nCommon: Rash, alopecia \nRare: Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n \n\n Common: Arthralgia, muscle \ndisorders  \nRare: Rhabdomyolysis \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\nCommon: fever, lethargy, \nfatigue. \n\nCommon: fatigue, malaise, \nfever. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAbacavir hypersensitivity \nThe signs and symptoms of this HSR are listed below. These have been identified either from clinical \nstudies or post marketing surveillance. Those reported in at least 10% of patients with a \nhypersensitivity reaction are in bold text. \n \nAlmost all patients developing hypersensitivity reactions will have fever and/or rash (usually \nmaculopapular or urticarial) as part of the syndrome, however reactions have occurred without rash or \nfever. Other key symptoms include gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as \nlethargy and malaise.  \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nSkin Rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial) \n \n\nGastrointestinal tract Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration \n \n\nRespiratory tract Dyspnoea, cough, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, \nrespiratory failure \n \n\nMiscellaneous Fever, lethargy, malaise, oedema, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, \nconjunctivitis, anaphylaxis \n \n\nNeurological/Psychiatry Headache, paraesthesia \n \n\nHaematological Lymphopenia \n \n\nLiver/pancreas Elevated liver function tests, hepatitis, hepatic failure \n \n\nMusculoskeletal Myalgia, rarely myolysis, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase \n \n\nUrology Elevated creatinine, renal failure \n \n\nSymptoms related to this HSR worsen with continued therapy and can be life- threatening and in rare \ninstance, have been fatal. \n \nRestarting abacavir following an abacavir HSR results in a prompt return of symptoms within hours. \nThis recurrence of the HSR is usually more severe than on initial presentation, and may include life-\nthreatening hypotension and death. Similar reactions have also occurred infrequently after restarting \nabacavir in patients who had only one of the key symptoms of hypersensitivity (see above) prior to \nstopping abacavir; and on very rare occasions have also been seen in patients who have restarted \ntherapy with no preceding symptoms of a HSR (i.e., patients previously considered to be abacavir \ntolerant). \n \nMetabolic parameters                                                                                                                         \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4) \n\n \nImmune reactivation syndrome  \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections \nmay arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been \nreported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more \nvariable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety database to support once daily dosing in paediatric patients comes from the ARROW Trial \n(COL105677) in which 669 HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects (from 12 months to ≤17 years old). \nreceived abacavir and lamivudine either once or twice daily (see section 5.1). Within this population, \n104 HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects weighing at least 25 kg received abacavir and lamivudine as \n\n\n\n14 \n\nKivexa once daily. No additional safety issues have been identified in paediatric subjects receiving \neither once or twice daily dosing compared to adults. \n\n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific symptoms or signs have been identified following acute overdose with abacavir or \nlamivudine, apart from those listed as undesirable effects.  \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and \nstandard supportive treatment applied as necessary. Since lamivudine is dialysable, continuous \nhaemodialysis could be used in the treatment of overdose, although this has not been studied. It is not \nknown whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations. ATC code: J05AR02.  \n \nMechanism of action: Abacavir and lamivudine are NRTIs, and are potent selective inhibitors of HIV-1 \nand HIV-2 (LAV2 and EHO) replication. Both abacavir and lamivudine are metabolised sequentially \nby intracellular kinases to the respective 5'-triphosphate (TP) which are the active moieties. \nLamivudine-TP and carbovir-TP (the active triphosphate form of abacavir) are substrates for and \ncompetitive inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). However, their main antiviral activity is \nthrough incorporation of the monophosphate form into the viral DNA chain, resulting in chain \ntermination. Abacavir and lamivudine triphosphates show significantly less affinity for host cell DNA \npolymerases. \n \n No antagonistic effects in vitro were seen with lamivudine and other antiretrovirals (tested \nagents:didanosine, nevirapine and zidovudine). The antiviral activity of abacavir in cell culture was not \nantagonized when combined with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine, \nemtricitabine,  stavudine, tenofovir  or zidovudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor \n(NNRTI) nevirapine, or the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir.   \n \nAntiviral Activity in vitro  \n \nBoth abacavir and lamivudine have been shown to inhibit replication of laboratory strains and clinical \nisolates of HIV in a number of cell types, including transformed T cell lines, monocyte/macrophage \nderived lines and primary cultures of activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and \nmonocyte/macrophages.  The concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50% (EC50) \nor 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) varied according to virus and host cell type.   \n \nThe mean EC50 for abacavir against laboratory strains of HIV-1IIIB and HIV-1HXB2 ranged from 1.4 \nto 5.8 µM. The median or mean EC50 values for lamivudine against laboratory strains of HIV-1 ranged \nfrom 0.007 to 2.3 µM. The mean EC50 against laboratory strains of HIV-2 (LAV2 and EHO) ranged \nfrom 1.57 to 7.5 µM for abacavir and from 0.16 to 0.51 µM for lamivudine.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\n \nThe EC50 values of abacavir against HIV-1 Group M subtypes (A-G) ranged from 0.002 to 1.179 µM, \nagainst Group O from 0.022 to 1.21 µM, and against HIV-2 isolates, from 0.024 to 0.49 µM. For \nlamivudine, the EC50 values against HIV-1 subtypes (A-G) ranged from 0.001 to 0.170 µM, against \nGroup O from 0.030 to 0.160 µM and against HIV-2 isolates from 0.002 to 0.120 µM in peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells. \n \nBaseline HIV-1 samples from therapy-naive subjects with no amino acid substitutions associated with \nresistance have been evaluated using either the multi-cycle Virco Antivirogram™ assay (n=92 from \nCOL40263) or the  the single cycle  Monogram Biosciences PhenoSense™ assay (n=138 from \nESS30009). These resulted in median EC50 values of 0.912 µM (range: 0.493 to 5.017 µM) and 1.26 \nµM (range 0.72 to 1.91 µM) respectively for abacavir, and median EC50 values of 0.429 µM (range: \n0.200 to 2.007 µM) and 2.38 µM (1.37 to 3.68 µM) respectively for lamivudine.  \n \nPhenotypic susceptibility analyses of clinical isolates from antiretroviral-naïve patients with  HIV-1 \nGroup M non-B subtypes in three studies have each reported that all viruses were fully susceptible to \nboth abacavir and lamivudine; one study of 104 isolates that included subtypes A and A1 (n=26), \nC (n=1), D (n=66), and the circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)  AD (n=9), CD (n=1), and a complex \ninter-subtype recombinant_cpx (n=1),  a second study of 18 isolates including subtype G (n=14) and \nCRF_AG (n=4) from Nigeria, and a third study of  six isolates (n=4 CRF_AG, n=1 A and n=1 \nundetermined) from Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire).  \n  \nHIV-1 isolates (CRF01_AE, n=12; CRF02_AG, n=12; and Subtype C or CRF_AC, n=13) from 37 \nuntreated patients in Africa and Asia were susceptible to abacavir (IC50 fold changes <2.5), and \nlamivudine (IC50 fold changes<3.0), except for two CRF02_AG isolates with fold-changes of 2.9 and \n3.4 for abacavir.  Group O isolates from antiviral naïve patients tested for lamivudine activity were \nhighly sensitive.   \n \nThe combination of abacavir and lamivudine has demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against \nnon-subtype B isolates and HIV-2 isolates with equivalent antiviral activity as for subtype B isolates.  \n \nResistance \n \nIn vivo resistance  \n \nAbacavir-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in-vitro in wild-type strain HIV-1 (HXB2) and \nare associated with specific genotypic changes in the RT codon region (codons M184V, K65R, L74V \nand Y115).  Selection for the M184V mutation occurred first and resulted in a two fold increase in IC50.  \nContinued passage in increasing concentrations of drug resulted in selection for double RT mutants \n65R/184V and 74V/184V or triple RT mutant 74V/115Y/184V.  Two mutations conferred a 7- to \n8-fold change in abacavir susceptibility and combinations of three mutations were required to confer \nmore than an 8-fold change in susceptibility.  Passage with a zidovudine resistant clinical isolate \nRTMC also selected for the 184V mutation. \n \nHIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184I or, more commonly, M184V \namino acid change close to the active site of the viral RT. Passage of HIV-1 (HXB2) in the presence of \nincreasing 3TC concentrations results in high-level (>100 to >500-fold) lamivudine-resistant viruses \nand the RT M184I or V mutation is rapidly selected.  The IC50 for wild-type HXB2 is 0.24 to 0.6 µM, \nwhile the IC50 for M184V containing HXB2 is >100 to 500 µM.  \n \nAntiviral therapy According to Genotypic/Phenotypic Resistance \n \nIn vivo resistance (Therapy-naïve patients)  \n \nThe M184V or M184I variants arise in HIV-1 infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing \nantiretroviral therapy. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nIsolates from most patients experiencing virological failure with a regimen containing abacavir in \npivotal clinical trials showed either no NRTI-related changes from baseline (45%) or only M184V or \nM184I selection (45%).  The overall selection frequency for M184V or M184I was high (54%), and \nless common was the selection of L74V (5%), K65R (1%) and Y115F (1%) (see table below).  The \ninclusion of zidovudine in the regimen has been found to reduce the frequency of L74V and K65R \nselection in the presence of abacavir (with zidovudine: 0/40, without zidovudine: 15/192, 8%). \n \n\nTherapy \n \n\nAbacavir + \nCombivir1 \n\nAbacavir + \nlamivudine + \n\nNNRTI \n\nAbacavir + \nlamivudine + \n\nPI (or \nPI/ritonavir) \n\nTotal \n\nNumber of \nSubjects 282 1094 909 2285 \n\nNumber of \nVirological \n\nFailures \n43 90 158 306 \n\nNumber of On-\nTherapy  \n\nGenotypes \n40 (100%) 51 (100%)2 141 (100%) 232 (100%) \n\nK65R 0 1 (2%) 2 (1%) 3 (1%) \n\nL74V 0 9 (18%) 3 (2%) 12 (5%) \nY115F 0 2 (4%) 0 2 (1%) \n\nM184V/I 34 (85%) 22 (43%) 70 (50%) 126 (54%) \nTAMs3 3 (8%) 2 (4%) 4 (3%) 9 (4%) \n\n1.

Number of subjects with ≥1 Thymidine Analogue Mutations (TAMs). \n \nTAMs might be selected when thymidine analogs are associated with abacavir. In a meta-analysis of \nsix clinical trials, TAMs were not selected by regimens containing abacavir without zidovudine \n(0/127), but were selected by regimens containing abacavir and the thymidine analogue zidovudine \n(22/86, 26%). \n \nIn vivo resistance (Therapy experienced patients)   \n \nThe M184V or M184I variants arise in HIV-1 infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing \nantiretroviral therapy and confer high-level resistance to lamivudine. In vitro data tend to suggest that \nthe continuation of lamivudine in anti-retroviral regimen despite the development of M184V might \nprovide residual anti-retroviral activity (likely through impaired viral fitness).  The clinical relevance of \nthese findings is not established.  Indeed, the available clinical data are very limited and preclude any \nreliable conclusion in the field.  In any case, initiation of susceptible NRTIs should always be preferred \nto maintenance of lamivudine therapy. Therefore, maintaining lamivudine therapy despite emergence \nof M184V mutation should only be considered in cases where no other active NRTIs are available. \n \nClinically significant reduction of susceptibility to abacavir has been demonstrated in clinical isolates \nof patients with uncontrolled viral replication, who have been pre-treated with and are resistant to other \nnucleoside inhibitors. In a meta-analysis of five clinical trials where ABC was added to intensify \ntherapy, of 166 subjects, 123 (74%) had M184V/I, 50 (30%) had T215Y/F, 45 (27%) had M41L, 30 \n(18%) had K70R and 25 (15%) had D67N.  K65R was absent and L74V and Y115F were uncommon \n(≤3%).  Logistic regression modelling of the predictive value for genotype (adjusted for baseline \nplasma HIV-1RNA [vRNA], CD4+ cell count, number and duration of prior antiretroviral therapies) \nshowed that the presence of 3 or more NRTI resistance-associated mutations was associated with \nreduced response at Week 4 (p=0.015) or 4 or more mutations at median Week 24 (p≤0.012). In \naddition, the 69 insertion complex or the Q151M mutation, usually found in combination with A62V, \n\n\n\n17 \n\nV75I, F77L and F116Y, cause a high level of resistance to abacavir. \n \n\nBaseline Reverse \nTranscriptase \n\nMutation \n\nWeek 4 \n(n = 166) \n\nn \nMedian \n\nChange vRNA \n(log10 c/mL) \n\nPercent with \n<400 copies/mL vRNA \n\nNone 15 -0.96 40% \nM184V alone  75 -0.74 64% \n\nAny one NRTI \nmutation 82 -0.72 65% \n\nAny two NRTI-\nassociated mutations  22 -0.82 32% \n\nAny three NRTI-\nassociated mutations 19 -0.30 5% \n\nFour or more NRTI-\nassociated mutations 28 -0.07 11% \n\n \nPhenotypic resistance and cross-resistance   \n \nPhenotypic resistance to abacavir requires M184V with at least one other abacavir-selected mutation, \nor M184V with multiple TAMs. Phenotypic cross-resistance to other NRTIs with M184V or M184I \nmutation alone is limited. Zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine and tenofovir maintain their antiretroviral \nactivities against such HIV-1 variants. The presence of M184V with K65R does give rise to cross-\nresistance between abacavir, tenofovir, didanosine and lamivudine, and M184V with L74V gives rise \nto cross-resistance between abacavir, didanosine and lamivudine. The presence of M184V with Y115F \ngives rise to cross-resistance between abacavir and lamivudine. Readily available genotypic drug \nresistance interpretation algorithms and commercially available susceptibility tests have established \nclinical cut offs for reduced activity for abacavir and lamivudine as separate drug entities that predict \nsusceptibility, partial susceptibility or resistance based upon either direct measurement of susceptibility \nor by calculation of the HIV-1 resistance phenotype from the viral genotype.  Appropriate use of \nabacavir and lamivudine can be guided using these currently recommended resistance algorithms. \n \nCross-resistance between abacavir or lamivudine and antiretrovirals from other classes e.g. PIs or \nNNRTIs is unlikely.  \n \nClinical experience \n \nClinical experience with the combination of abacavir and lamivudine as a once daily regimen is mainly \nbased on four studies in treatment-naïve subjects, CNA30021, EPZ104057 (HEAT study), ACTG5202, \nand CNA109586 (ASSERT study) and two studies in treatment-experienced subjects, CAL30001 and \nESS30008. \n \nTherapy-naïve patients \n  \nThe combination of abacavir and lamivudine as a once daily regimen is supported by a 48 weeks \nmulti-centre, double-blind, controlled study (CNA30021) of 770 HIV-infected, therapy-naïve adults. \nThese were primarily asymptomatic HIV infected patients (CDC stage A). They were randomised to \nreceive either abacavir (ABC) 600 mg once daily or 300 mg twice daily, in combination with \nlamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily.

From these results, it can be concluded with 95% confidence that the true difference \nis no greater than 8.4% in favour of the twice daily regimen. This potential difference is sufficiently small \nto draw an overall conclusion of non-inferiority of abacavir once daily over abacavir twice daily. \n \nThere was a low, similar overall incidence of virologic failure (viral load > 50 copies/ml) in both the \nonce and twice daily treatment groups (10% and 8% respectively). In the small sample size for \ngenotypic analysis, there was a trend toward a higher rate of NRTI-associated mutations in the once \ndaily versus the twice daily abacavir regimens. No firm conclusion could be drawn due to the limited \ndata derived from this study.  \n \nThere are conflicting data in some comparative studies with Kivexa i.e. HEAT, ACTG5202 and \nASSERT: \n \nEPZ104057 (HEAT study) was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-matched, 96 week, multi-centre \nstudy with the primary objective of evaluating the relative efficacy of abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC, \n600mg/300mg) and tenofovir /emtricitabine (TDF/FTC, 300mg/200mg), each given once-daily in \ncombination with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r, 800mg/200mg) in HIV-infected, therapy-naive adults.  \nThe primary efficacy analysis was performed at week 48 with study continuation to week 96 and \ndemonstrated non-inferiority.

Patients were stratified at screening \nbased on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 100,000 and ≥ 100,000 copies/mL. \n  \nAn interim analysis from ACTG 5202 revealed that abacavir/lamivudine was associated with a \nstatistically significantly higher risk of virological failure as compared to emtricitabine/tenofovir \n(defined as viral load >1000 copies/mL at or after 16 weeks and before 24 weeks or HIV-RNA level \n>200 copies/mL at or after 24 weeks) in subjects with a screening viral load ≥100,000 copies/mL \n(estimated hazard ratio: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.46, 3.72, p=0.0003). The Data Safety Monitoring Board \n(DSMB) recommended that consideration be given to change in the therapeutic management of all \nsubjects in the high viral load stratum due to the efficacy differences observed. The subjects in the low \nviral load stratum remained blinded and on-study. \n\nAnalysis of the data from subjects in the low viral load stratum showed no demonstrable difference \nbetween the nucleoside backbones in the proportion of patients free of virological failure at week 96. \nThe results are presented below: \n\n- 88.3% with ABC/3TC vs 90.3% with TDF/FTC when taken with atazanavir/ritonovir as third \ndrug, treatment difference -2.0% (95% CI -7.5%, 3.4%), \n- 87.4% with ABC/3TC vs 89.2% with TDF/FTC, when taken with efavirenz as third drug, \ntreatment difference -1.8% (95% CI -7.5%, 3.9%). \n\n \nCNA109586 (ASSERT study), a multi-centre, open label, randomised study of abacavir/lamivudine \n(ABC/3TC, 600mg/300mg) and tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC, 300mg/200mg), each given once \ndaily with efavirenz (EFV, 600mg) in ART naïve, HLA-B*5701 negative, HIV-1 infected adults.The \nvirologic results are summarised in the table below: \nVirologic Response at Week 48 ITT-Exposed Population < 50 copies/ml TLOVR \n\n ABC/3TC + EFV (N =192) \nTDF/FTC + EFV \n\n(N =193) \nOverall response 114/192 \n\n(59%) \n137/193 \n(71%) \n\nResponse by Baseline \nHIV-1 RNA <100,000 \nc/mL \n\n61/95 \n(64%) \n\n62/83 \n(75%) \n\nResponse by Baseline \nHIV-1 RNA ≥100,000 \nc/mL \n\n53/97 \n(55%) \n\n75/110 \n(68%) \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nAt week 48, a lower rate of virologic response was observed for ABC/3TC compared to TDF/FTC \n(point estimate for the treatment difference: 11.6%, 95% CI: 2.2, 21.1). \n \nTherapy-experienced patients \n \nData from two studies, CAL30001 and ESS30008 demonstrated that Kivexa once daily has similar \nvirological efficacy to abacavir 300 mg twice daily plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily or 150 mg twice \ndaily in therapy-experienced patients. \n \nIn study CAL30001, 182 treatment-experienced patients with virologic failure were randomised and \nreceived treatment with either Kivexa once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily plus lamivudine \n300 mg once daily, both in combination with tenofovir and a PI or an NNRTI for 48 weeks. Similar \nreductions in HIV-1 RNA as measured by average area under the curve minus baseline were observed,  \nindicating that the Kivexa group was non-inferior to the abacavir plus lamivudine twice daily group \n(AAUCMB, -1.65 log10 copies/ml versus -1.83 log10 copies/ml respectively, 95% CI -0.13, 0.38). \nProportions with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml (50% versus 47%) and < 400 copies/ml (54% versus \n57%) at week 48 were also similar in each group (ITT population). However, as there were only \nmoderately experienced patients included in this study with an imbalance in baseline viral load between \nthe arms, these results should be interpreted with caution. \n \nIn study ESS30008, 260 patients with virologic suppression on a first line therapy regimen containing \nabacavir 300 mg plus lamivudine 150 mg, both given twice daily and a PI or NNRTI, were randomised \nto continue this regimen or switch to Kivexa plus a PI or NNRTI for 48 weeks.

After 36 \nweeks on a regimen including twice daily abacavir and lamivudine, 669 eligible subjects were \nrandomised to either continue twice daily dosing or switch to once daily abacavir and lamivudine for at \nleast an additional 96 weeks.  Within this population, 104 patients, weighing at least 25 kg, received \n600 mg abacavir and 300 mg lamivudine as Kivexa once daily, with a median duration of exposure of \n596 days.  \n \nAmong the 669 subjects randomized in this study (from 12 months to ≤17 years old), the \nabacavir/lamivudine once daily dosing group was demonstrated to be non-inferior to the twice daily \ngroup according to the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -12%, for the primary endpoint of <80 \nc/mL at Week 48 as well as at Week 96 (secondary endpoint) and all other thresholds tested \n(<200c/mL, <400c/mL, <1000c/mL), which all fell well within this non-inferiority margin. Subgroup \nanalyses testing for heterogeneity of once versus twice daily demonstrated no significant effect of sex, \nage, or viral load at randomisation. Conclusions supported non-inferiority regardless of analysis \nmethod. \n \nAmong the 104 patients who received Kivexa, including the ones who were between 40 kg and 25 kg, \nthe viral suppression was similar \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe fixed-dose combination tablet of abacavir/lamivudine (FDC) has been shown to be bioequivalent \nto lamivudine and abacavir administered separately. This was demonstrated in a single dose, 3-way \ncrossover bioequivalence study of FDC (fasted) versus 2 x 300 mg abacavir tablets plus 2 x 150 mg \nlamivudine tablets (fasted) versus FDC administered with a high fat meal, in healthy volunteers \n(n = 30). In the fasted state there was no significant difference in the extent of absorption, as measured \nby the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal peak concentration (Cmax), \nof each component. There was also no clinically significant food effect observed between \nadministration of FDC in the fasted or fed state. These results indicate that FDC can be taken with or \nwithout food. The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine and abacavir are described below. \n\n\n\n22 \n\nAbsorption \n \nAbacavir and lamivudine are rapidly and well absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract following oral \nadministration. The absolute bioavailability of oral abacavir and lamivudine in adults is about 83% and \n80-85% respectively. The mean time to maximal serum concentrations (tmax) is about 1.5 hours and \n1.0 hour for abacavir and lamivudine, respectively. Following a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir, the \nmean (CV) Cmax is 4.26 µg/ml (28%) and the mean (CV) AUC∞ is 11.95 µg.h/ml (21%). Following \nmultiple-dose oral administration of lamivudine 300 mg once daily for seven days, the mean (CV) \nsteady-state Cmax is 2.04 µg/ml (26%) and the mean (CV) AUC24 is 8.87 µg.h/ml (21%). \n \nDistribution \n \nIntravenous studies with abacavir and lamivudine showed that the mean apparent volume of \ndistribution is 0.8 and 1.3 l/kg respectively. Plasma protein binding studies in vitro indicate that \nabacavir binds only low to moderately (~49%) to human plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. \nLamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays limited \nplasma protein binding in vitro (< 36%). This indicates a low likelihood for interactions with other \nmedicinal products through plasma protein binding displacement. \n \nData show that abacavir and lamivudine penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) and reach the \ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Studies with abacavir demonstrate a CSF to plasma AUC ratio of between \n30 to 44%. The observed values of the peak concentrations are 9 fold greater than the IC50 of abacavir \nof 0.08 µg/ml or 0.26 µM when abacavir is given at 600 mg twice daily. The mean ratio of CSF/serum \nlamivudine concentrations 2-4 hours after oral administration was approximately 12%. The true extent \nof CNS penetration of lamivudine and its relationship with any clinical efficacy is unknown.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAbacavir is primarily metabolised by the liver with approximately 2% of the administered dose being \nrenally excreted, as unchanged compound. The primary pathways of metabolism in man are by alcohol \ndehydrogenase and by glucuronidation to produce the 5’-carboxylic acid and 5’-glucuronide which \naccount for about 66% of the administered dose. These metabolites are excreted in the urine. \n \nMetabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. Lamivudine is predominately cleared by \nrenal excretion of unchanged lamivudine. The likelihood of metabolic drug interactions with \nlamivudine is low due to the small extent of hepatic metabolism (5-10%). \n \nElimination \n \nThe mean half-life of abacavir is about 1.5 hours. Following multiple oral doses of abacavir 300 mg \ntwice a day there is no significant accumulation of abacavir. Elimination of abacavir is via hepatic \nmetabolism with subsequent excretion of metabolites primarily in the urine. The metabolites and \nunchanged abacavir account for about 83% of the administered abacavir dose in the urine. The \nremainder is eliminated in the faeces. \n \nThe observed lamivudine half-life of elimination is 5 to 7 hours. The mean systemic clearance of \nlamivudine is approximately 0.32 l/h/kg, predominantly by renal clearance (> 70%) via the organic \ncationic transport system. Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is \naffected by renal dysfunction. Kivexa is not recommended for use in patients with a creatinine \nclearance < 50 ml/min as necessary dose adjustment cannot be made (see section 4.2).  \n \nIntracellular pharmacokinetics \n \nIn a study of 20 HIV-infected patients receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily, with only one 300 mg \ndose taken prior to the 24 hour sampling period, the geometric mean terminal carbovir-TP intracellular \nhalf-life at steady-state was 20.6 hours, compared to the geometric mean abacavir plasma half-life in \n\n\n\n23 \n\nthis study of 2.6 hours. In a crossover study in 27 HIV-infected patients, intracellular carbovir-TP \nexposures were higher for the abacavir 600 mg once daily regimen (AUC24,ss  + 32%, Cmax24,ss + 99% \nand Ctrough + 18%) compared to the 300 mg twice daily regimen. For patients receiving lamivudine \n300 mg once daily, the terminal intracellular half-life of lamivudine-TP was prolonged to 16-19 hours, \ncompared to the plasma lamivudine half-life of 5-7 hours. In a crossover study in 60 healthy volunteers, \nintracellular lamivudine-TP pharmacokinetic parameters were similar (AUC24,ss and Cmax24,ss) or lower \n(Ctrough – 24%) for the lamivudine 300 mg once daily regimen compared to the lamivudine 150 mg \ntwice daily regimen. Overall, these data support the use of lamivudine 300 mg and abacavir 600 mg \nonce daily for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of this \ncombination given once daily has been demonstrated in a pivotal clinical study (CNA30021- See \nClinical experience).  \n \nSpecial  patient populations \n \nHepatic impairment  \n \nPharmacokinetic data has been obtained for abacavir and lamivudine separately. \n \nAbacavir is metabolised primarily by the liver. The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in \npatients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6) receiving a single 600 mg dose; the \nmedian (range) AUC value was 24.1 (10.4 to 54.8) ug.h/ml.The results showed that there was a mean \n(90%CI) increase of 1.89 fold [1.32; 2.70] in the abacavir AUC, and 1.58 [1.22; 2.04] fold in the \nelimination half-life. No definitive recommendation on dose reduction is possible in patients with mild \nhepatic impairment due to substantial variability of abacavir exposure.  \n \nData obtained in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment show that lamivudine \npharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by hepatic dysfunction. \n \nBased on data obtained for abacavir, Kivexa is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment  \n \nPharmacokinetic data have been obtained for lamivudine and abacavir alone. Abacavir is primarily \nmetabolised by the liver with approximately 2% of abacavir excreted unchanged in the urine. The \npharmacokinetics of abacavir in patients with end-stage renal disease is similar to patients with normal \nrenal function. Studies with lamivudine show that plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in \npatients with renal dysfunction due to decreased clearance. Kivexa is not recommended for use in \npatients with a creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min as necessary dose adjustment cannot be made. \n \nElderly  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in patients over 65 years of age. \n \nChildren \n \nAbacavir is rapidly and well absorbed from oral formulations when administered to children.  \nPaediatric pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that once daily dosing provides equivalent \nAUC24 to twice daily dosing of the same total daily dose for both oral solution and tablet formulations.  \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of lamivudine (approximately 58 to 66%) was lower and more variable in \npaediatric patients under 12 years of age.  However, paediatric pharmacokinetic studies with tablet \nformulations have demonstrated that once daily dosing provides equivalent AUC24 to twice daily \ndosing of the same total daily dose.  \n \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nWith the exception of a negative in vivo rat micronucleus test, there are no data available on the effects \nof the combination of abacavir and lamivudine in animals.  \n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity \n \nNeither abacavir nor lamivudine were mutagenic in bacterial tests, but consistent with other nucleoside \nanalogues, they inhibit cellular DNA replication in in vitro mammalian tests such as the mouse \nlymphoma assay. The results of an in vivo rat micronucleus test with abacavir and lamivudine in \ncombination were negative.  \n \nLamivudine has not shown any genotoxic activity in the in vivo studies at doses that gave plasma \nconcentrations up to 40-50 times higher than clinical plasma concentrations. Abacavir has a weak \npotential to cause chromosomal damage both in vitro and in vivo at high tested concentrations.  \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of a combination of abacavir and lamivudine has not been tested. In \nlong-term oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, lamivudine did not show any carcinogenic \npotential. Carcinogenicity studies with orally administered abacavir in mice and rats showed an \nincrease in the incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumours. Malignant tumours occurred in the \npreputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in rats in the thyroid \ngland of males and in the liver, urinary bladder, lymph nodes and the subcutis of females.  \n \nThe majority of these tumours occurred at the highest abacavir dose of 330 mg/kg/day in mice and \n600 mg/kg/day in rats. The exception was the preputial gland tumour which occurred at a dose of \n110 mg/kg in mice. The systemic exposure at the no effect level in mice and rats was equivalent to 3 \nand 7 times the human systemic exposure during therapy. While the clinical relevance of these findings \nis unknown, these data suggest that a carcinogenic risk to humans is outweighed by the potential \nclinical benefit. \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity  \n \nIn toxicology studies abacavir was shown to increase liver weights in rats and monkeys. The clinical \nrelevance of this is unknown. There is no evidence from clinical studies that abacavir is hepatotoxic. \nAdditionally, autoinduction of abacavir metabolism or induction of the metabolism of other medicinal \nproducts hepatically metabolised has not been observed in man. \n \nMild myocardial degeneration in the heart of mice and rats was observed following administration of \nabacavir for two years. The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic \nexposure in humans. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies in animals, lamivudine and abacavir were shown to cross the placenta. \n \nLamivudine was not teratogenic in animal studies but there were indications of an increase in early \nembryonic deaths in rabbits at relatively low systemic exposures, comparable to those achieved in \nhumans. A similar effect was not seen in rats even at very high systemic exposure. \n \nAbacavir demonstrated toxicity to the developing embryo and foetus in rats, but not in rabbits. These \nfindings included decreased foetal body weight, foetal oedema, and an increase in skeletal \nvariations/malformations, early intra-uterine deaths and still births. No conclusion can be drawn with \nregard to the teratogenic potential of abacavir because of this embryo-foetal toxicity. \n \nA fertility study in rats has shown that abacavir and lamivudine had no effect on male or female \nfertility. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \nIMPORTANT — Hypersensitivity reactions \n\nKivexa contains abacavir (which is also an active substance in medicines such as Trizivir, Triumeq \nand Ziagen). Some people who take abacavir may develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a serious \nallergic reaction), which can be life-threatening if they continue to take abacavir containing products. \nYou must carefully read all the information under ‘Hypersensitivity reactions’ in the panel in \nSection 4. \n\nThe Kivexa pack includes an Alert Card, to remind you and medical staff about abacavir \nhypersensitivity. Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n\n1. What Kivexa is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Kivexa \n3. How to take Kivexa \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Kivexa  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n\n1. What  Kivexa is and what it is used for \n \nKivexa is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in adults, adolescents and \nin children weighing at least 25 kg.  \n \nKivexa contains two active ingredients that are used to treat HIV infection: abacavir and lamivudine.  \nThese belong to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NRTIs). \n \nKivexa does not completely cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps \nit at a low level. It also increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood \ncells that are important in helping your body to fight infection. \n  \nNot everyone responds to treatment with Kivexa in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the \neffectiveness of your treatment. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Kivexa  \n\n  \nDo not take Kivexa: \n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to abacavir (or any other medicine containing abacavir — (e.g. \n\nTrizivir, Triumeq or Ziagen), lamivudine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \nin Section 6) \nCarefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4. \nCheck with your doctor if you think this applies to you. Do not take Kivexa \n\nTake special care with Kivexa \n\nSome people taking Kivexa or other combination treatments for HIV are more at risk of serious side \neffects. You need to be aware of the extra risks: \n• if you have  moderate or severe liver disease \n• if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C  (if you have hepatitis B infection, do \n\nnot stop Kivexa without your doctor’s advice, as your hepatitis may come back) \n• if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman) \n• if you have a kidney problem  \n\nTalk to your doctor if any of these apply to you before using Kivexa. You may need extra \ncheck-ups, including blood tests, while you are taking your medicine. See Section 4 for more \ninformation.  \n\n \nAbacavir hypersensitivity reactions \n\nEven patients who don’t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction \n(a serious allergic reaction) \n\n \nCarefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4 of this leaflet. \n\n \nRisk of heart attack \nIt cannot be excluded that abacavir may increase the risk of having a heart attack. \n\nTell your doctor if you have heart problems, if you smoke, or have other illnesses that may \nincrease your risk of heart disease such as high blood pressure, or diabetes. Do not stop taking \nKivexa unless your doctor advises you to do so. \n\n \nLook out for important symptoms \nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. You \nneed to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Kivexa. \n\nRead the information ‘Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV’ in \nSection 4 of this leaflet. \n\n \nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of \ninfected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You can still pass on HIV when taking this \nmedicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people. \n \nOther medicines and Kivexa \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or if you have taken any \nrecently, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.  \n\nRemember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking \nKivexa. \n \nThese medicines should not be used with Kivexa: \n• Emtricitabine, to treat HIV infection \n• other medicinal products containing lamivudine, used to treat HIV infection or hepatitis B \n\ninfection \n\n\n\n42 \n\n• high doses of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic \n• cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia \n\nTell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these. \n \n \nSome medicines interact with Kivexa \nThese include: \n \n• phenytoin, for treating epilepsy.   \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking phenytoin. Your doctor may need to monitor you while \nyou are taking Kivexa. \n\n \n• methadone, used as a heroin substitute. Abacavir increases the rate at which methadone is \n\nremoved from the body. If you are taking methadone, you will be checked for any withdrawal \nsymptoms. Your methadone dose may need to be changed.  \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking methadone. \n \n\n• medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, mannitol, \nlactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly.                                                                                                \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. \n\n \nPregnancy \nKivexa is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Kivexa and similar medicines may cause \nside effects in unborn babies.  \nIf you have taken Kivexa  during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and \nother diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took NRTIs \nduring pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. \n \nBreast-feeding \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast-feed, because HIV infection can be passed on to the \nbaby in breast milk. A small amount of the ingredients in Kivexa can also pass into your breast milk. \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \nTalk to your doctor immediately. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nKivexa may cause side effects which could affect your ability to drive or use machines.  \n\n       Talk to your doctor about your ability to drive or operate machines while taking    \n            Kivexa.  \n \n\nImportant information about some of the other ingredients of Kivexa tablets \nKivexa contains a colouring called sunset yellow (E110), this may cause allergic reactions in some \npeople. \n \n3. How to take Kivexa  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\nThe recommended dose of Kivexa for adults, adolescents and children weighing 25 kg or more \nis one tablet once a day.  \n\nSwallow the tablets whole, with some water. Kivexa can be taken with or without food. \n\nStay in regular contact with your doctor \nKivexa helps to control your condition. You need to keep taking it every day to stop your illness \ngetting worse. You may still develop other infections and illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n\nKeep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Kivexa without your doctor’s advice. \n\n\n\n43 \n\nIf you take more Kivexa than you should \n\nIf you accidentally take too much Kivexa, tell your doctor or your pharmacist, or contact your nearest \nhospital emergency department for further advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Kivexa \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue your treatment as before.  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n \nIt is important to take Kivexa regularly, because if you take it at irregular intervals, you may be more \nlikely to have a hypersensitivity reaction. \n \nIf you have stopped taking Kivexa \nIf you have stopped taking Kivexa for any reason — especially because you think you are having side \neffects, or because you have other illness: \n\nTalk to your doctor before you start taking it again. Your doctor will check whether your \nsymptoms were related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been \nrelated, you will be told never again to take Kivexa, or any other medicine containing abacavir \n(e.g.Trizivir,Triumeq  or Ziagen). It is important that you follow this advice. \n\n \nIf your doctor advises that you can start taking Kivexa again, you may be asked to take your first doses \nin a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n\n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  \n\n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. \n  \nWhen you are being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of Kivexa \nor other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV disease itself. So it is very important to talk \nto your doctor about any changes in your health. \n \n\nEven patients who don’t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction \n(a serious allergic reaction), described in this leaflet in the panel headed ‘Hypersensitivity \nreactions’.  \n\n \n It is very important that you read and understand the information about this serious \nreaction. \n \n\nAs well as the side effects listed below for Kivexa, other conditions can develop during combination \ntherapy for HIV.  \n\nIt is important to read the information later in this section under ‘Other possible side effects of \ncombination therapy for HIV’. \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n44 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nKivexa contains abacavir (which is also an active substance in medicines such as Trizivir, Triumeq \nand Ziagen). Abacavir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction.   \nThese hypersensitivity reactions have been seen more frequently in people taking medicines that \ncontain abacavir.  \n \n \nWho gets these reactions? \nAnyone taking Kivexa could develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, which could be life \nthreatening if they continue to take Kivexa. \n\nYou are more likely to develop this reaction if you have a gene called HLA-B*5701 (but you can get a \nreaction even if you do not have this gene). You should have been tested for this gene before Kivexa \nwas prescribed for you. If you know you have this gene, tell your doctor before you take Kivexa. \n \nAbout 3 to 4 in every 100 patients treated with abacavir in a clinical trial who did not have the HLA-\nB*5701 gene developed a hypersensitivity reaction. \n \nWhat are the symptoms? \nThe most common symptoms are: \n• fever (high temperature) and skin rash. \n \nOther common symptoms are: \n• nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), diarrhoea, abdominal (stomach) pain, severe  \n tiredness. \n \nOther symptoms include: \n \nPains in the joints or muscles, swelling of the neck, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough, occasional \nheadaches, inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis), mouth ulcers, low blood pressure, tingling or \nnumbness of the hands or feet. \n \n \nWhen do these reactions happen? \n \nHypersensitivity reactions can start at any time during treatment with Kivexa, but are more likely \nduring the first 6 weeks of treatment. \n \n \nContact your doctor immediately: \n1 if you get a skin rash, OR \n2 if you get symptoms from at least 2 of the following groups: \n - fever  \n - shortness of breath, sore throat or cough \n - nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain \n - severe tiredness or achiness, or generally feeling ill. \n \nYour doctor may advise you to stop taking Kivexa. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nIf you have stopped taking Kivexa \n\nIf you have stopped taking Kivexa because of a hypersensitivity reaction, you must NEVER AGAIN \ntake Kivexa, or any other medicine containing abacavir (e.g. Trizivir, Triumeq or Ziagen). If you \ndo, within hours, your blood pressure could fall dangerously low, which could result in death. \n\nIf you have stopped taking Kivexa for any reason — especially because you think you are having side \neffects, or because you have other illness: \n\nTalk to your doctor before you start again. Your doctor will check whether your symptoms were \nrelated to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been, you will then be told \nnever again to take Kivexa, or any other medicine containing abacavir (e.g. Trizivir,  Triumeq or \nZiagen). It is important that you follow this advice. \n \nOccasionally hypersensitivity reactions have developed in people who start taking abacavir containing \nproducts again, but who had only one symptom on the Alert Card before they stopped taking it. \n\nVery rarely patients who have taken medicines containing abacavir in the past without any symptoms \nof hypersensitivity have developed a hypersensitivity reaction when they start taking these medicines \nagain. \n\n \nIf your doctor advises that you can start taking Kivexa again, you may be asked to take your first doses \nin a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. \n \nIf you are hypersensitive to Kivexa, return all your unused Kivexa tablets for safe disposal. Ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\nThe Kivexa pack includes an Alert Card, to remind you and medical staff about hypersensitivity \nreactions. Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. \n\n \n\n \nCommon side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n• hypersensitivity reaction  \n• headache \n• being sick (vomiting) \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n• diarrhoea \n• stomach pains \n• loss of appetite \n• tiredness, lack of energy \n• fever (high temperature) \n• general feeling of being unwell \n• difficulty in sleeping (insomnia) \n• muscle pain and discomfort \n• joint pain \n• cough \n• irritated or runny nose \n• skin rash  \n• hair loss \n\nUncommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people and may show up in blood tests: \n• a low red blood cell count (anaemia) or low white blood cell count (neutropenia) \n• an increase in the level of liver enzymes \n• a decrease in the number of cells involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia). \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nRare side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: \n• liver disorders, such as jaundice, enlarged liver or fatty liver, inflammation (hepatitis) \n• inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) \n• breakdown of muscle tissue. \n \nRare side effects that may show up in blood tests are: \n• increase in an enzyme called amylase. \n \nVery rare side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people: \n• numbness, tingly feelings in the skin (pins and needles) \n• sensation of weakness in the limbs \n• skin rash, which may form blisters and  looks like small targets (central dark spots surrounded by a \n\npaler area, with a dark ring around the edge) (erythema multiforme) \n• a widespread rash with blisters and peeling skin, particularly around the mouth, nose, eyes and \n\ngenitals (Stevens–Johnson syndrome), and a more severe form causing skin peeling in more than \n30% of the body surface (toxic epidermal necrolysis). \n\n• lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) \n \n \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms contact a doctor urgently. \n\nVery rare side effects that may show up in blood tests are:  \n• a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells (pure red cell aplasia).  \n \nIf you get side effects \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects gets severe or troublesome, or if you \nnotice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. \n\n \nOther possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV \n\nCombination therapy such as Kivexa may cause other conditions to develop during HIV treatment. \n \nSymptoms of infection and inflammation \n\nOld infections may flare up \n\nPeople with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to \ndevelop serious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been “silent” and not \ndetected by the weak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the \nimmune system becomes stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of \ninfection or inflammation. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: \n\n• headache \n• stomach ache \n• difficulty breathing \n\nIn rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue \n(autoimmune disorders).  The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you \nstart taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: \n\n• palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor \n• hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)  \n• weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body \n\n \nIf you get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the symptoms above: \n\nTell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your doctor’s \nadvice. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n \n \nYou may have problems with your bones \n \nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this \ncondition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be \nmore likely to get this condition: \n• if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time \n• if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids \n• if they drink alcohol \n• if their immune systems are very weak \n• if they are overweight. \n\nSigns of osteonecrosis include: \n• stiffness in the joints \n• aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) \n• difficulty moving. \nIf you notice any of these symptoms: \n\nTell your doctor. \n \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5.
