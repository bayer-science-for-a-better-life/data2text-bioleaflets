NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nYENTREVE 20 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules \nYENTREVE 40 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nYENTREVE 20 mg \nEach capsule contains 20 mg of duloxetine (as hydrochloride). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect  \nEach capsule may contain up to 37 mg sucrose. \n \nYENTREVE 40 mg \nEach capsule contains 40 mg of duloxetine (as hydrochloride).  \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect  \nEach capsule may contain up to 74 mg sucrose. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard gastro-resistant capsule. \n \nYENTREVE 20 mg \nOpaque blue body, imprinted with ‘20 mg’ and an opaque blue cap, imprinted with ‘9544’. \n \nYENTREVE 40 mg \nOpaque orange body, imprinted with ’40 mg’ and an opaque blue cap, imprinted with ‘9545’. \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nYENTREVE is indicated for women for the treatment of moderate to severe Stress Urinary \nIncontinence (SUI). \n \nYENTREVE is indicated in adults. \nFor further information see section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of YENTREVE is 40 mg twice daily without regard to meals. After 2-4 weeks \nof treatment, patients should be re-assessed in order to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of the \ntherapy. Some patients may benefit from starting treatment at a dose of 20 mg twice daily for two \nweeks before increasing to the recommended dose of 40 mg twice daily. Dose escalation may \ndecrease, though not eliminate, the risk of nausea and dizziness. \n \nHowever, limited data are available to support the efficacy of YENTREVE 20 mg twice daily. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nThe efficacy of YENTREVE has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled \nstudies. The benefit of treatment should be re-assessed at regular intervals. \n \nCombining YENTREVE with a pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) programme may be more \neffective than either treatment alone. It is recommended that consideration be given to concomitant \nPFMT. \n \nHepatic impairment \nYENTREVE must not be used in women with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine \nclearance 30 to 80 ml/min). YENTREVE must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <30 ml/min; see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence has not been \nstudied. No data are available. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nCaution should be exercised when treating the elderly. \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nAbrupt discontinuation should be avoided. When stopping treatment with YENTREVE the dose \nshould be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of \nwithdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in \nthe dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be \nconsidered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nLiver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nYENTREVE should not be used in combination with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase \ninhibitors - MAOIs (see section 4.5).  \n \nYENTREVE should not be used in combination with CYP1A2 inhibitors, like fluvoxamine, \nciprofloxacin or enoxacin since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of \nduloxetine (see section 4.5). \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.4). \n \nThe initiation of treatment with YENTREVE is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled \nhypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMania and seizures \nYENTREVE should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar \ndisorder, and/or seizures. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nAs with other serotonergic agents, serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may \noccur with duloxetine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents \n(including SSRIs, SNRIs tricyclic antidepressants or triptans), with agents that impair metabolism of \nserotonin such as MAOIs, or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists that may affect the \nserotonergic neurotransmitter systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nSerotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, \ncoma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \naberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea). \n \nIf concomitant treatment with duloxetine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the \nserotonergic and/or dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in clinically warranted, careful observation \nof the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. \n \nSt John’s wort \nAdverse reactions may be more common during concomitant use of YENTREVE and herbal \npreparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \nMydriasis \nMydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when \nprescribing duloxetine in patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-\nangle glaucoma.  \n \nBlood pressure and heart rate \nDuloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant \nhypertension in some patients. This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. Cases of \nhypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing \nhypertension. Therefore, in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood \npressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. Duloxetine \nshould be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart \nrate or by an increase in blood pressure. Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used \nwith medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). For patients who experience \na sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual \ndiscontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). In patients with uncontrolled hypertension \nduloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nIncreased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on \nhaemodialysis (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). For patients with severe renal impairment, see \nsection 4.3. See section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction.  \n \nHaemorrhage  \nThere have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including duloxetine. Duloxetine may increase the risk of postpartum \nhaemorrhage (see section 4.6). Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal \nproducts known to affect platelet function (e.g. NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)), and in patients \nwith known bleeding tendencies. \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment \nWithdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is \nabrupt (see section 4.8). In a clinical trial, adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation \noccurred in approximately 44% of patients treated with YENTREVE and 24% of patients taking \nplacebo. \n \nThe risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI’s and SNRI’s may be dependent on several factors \nincluding the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. The most commonly \nreported reactions are listed in section 4.8. Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, \nin some patients they may be severe in intensity. They usually occur within the first few days of \ndiscontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have \ninadvertently missed a dose. Generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 \nweeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more). It is therefore \nadvised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no \nless than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2). \n \nHyponatraemia \nHyponatraemia has been reported when administering YENTREVE, including cases with serum \nsodium lower than 110 mmol/l. Hyponatraemia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-\ndiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The majority of cases of hyponatraemia were reported in the \nelderly, especially when coupled with a recent history of, or condition pre-disposing to, altered fluid \nbalance. Caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatraemia, such as elderly, cirrhotic, \nor dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics.  \n \nDepression, suicidal ideation and behaviour \nAlthough YENTREVE is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient \n(duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medicinal product. Depression is associated with an \nincreased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). This risk persists \nuntil significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more \nof treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. It is general clinical \nexperience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. Patients with a history \nof suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal thoughts prior to \ncommencement of treatment are known to be at a greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal \nbehaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an \nincreased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 \nyears old. \n \nCases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or \nearly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). Physicians should encourage patients to report \nany distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive symptoms at any time. If while on YENTREVE \ntherapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive symptoms, specialised medical advice should be \nsought, as depression is a serious medical condition. If a decision to initiate antidepressant \npharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of YENTREVE is recommended (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years of age \nYENTREVE should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 \nyears. Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility \n(predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in \nclinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated \nwith placebo. If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be \ncarefully monitored for the appearance of suicidal symptoms.  In addition, long-term safety data in \nchildren and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development \nare lacking. \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nMedicinal products containing duloxetine \nDuloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic \npain, major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and stress urinary incontinence). The use \nof more than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided. \n \nHepatitis/increased liver enzymes \nCases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (>10 times upper limit of normal), \nhepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). Most of them occurred \nduring the first months of treatment. The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular. \nDuloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated \nwith hepatic injury. \n \nAkathisia/psychomotor restlessness \nThe use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a \nsubjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability \nto sit or stand still. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who \ndevelop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. \n \nSexual dysfunction \nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) \nmay cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see section 4.8). There have been reports of long-lasting \nsexual dysfunction where the symptoms have continued despite discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRIs. \n \nSucrose \nYENTREVE hard gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \nfructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not \ntake this medicine. \n \nSodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, duloxetine should not \nbe used in combination with non-selective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or \nwithin at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Based on the half-life of duloxetine, \nat least 5 days should be allowed after stopping YENTREVE before starting an MAOI (see section \n4.3). \n \nThe concomitant use of YENTREVE with selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). The antibiotic linezolid is a reversible non-selective MAOI and should \nnot be given to patients treated with YENTREVE (see section 4.4). \n \nInhibitors of CYP1A2: Because CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of \nYENTREVE with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of \nduloxetine. Fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent \nplasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased AUC0-t 6-fold. Therefore YENTREVE \nshould not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see \nsection 4.3).  \n \nCNS medicinal products: Caution is advised when YENTREVE is taken in combination with other \ncentrally acting medicinal products or substances, including alcohol and sedative medicinal products \n(e.g. benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).  \n \nSerotonergic agents: In rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using \nSSRIs/SNRIs concomitantly with serotonergic agents. Caution is advisable if YENTREVE is used \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nconcomitantly with serotonergic agents like SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants like clomipramine \nor amitriptyline, MAOIs like moclobemide or linezolid, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or \ntriptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan (see section 4.4). \n \nEffect of duloxetine on other medicinal products \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2: The pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 \nsubstrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).  \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6: Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When \nduloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a \nCYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold. The co-administration of duloxetine \n(40 mg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does \nnot affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is \nrecommended. Caution is advised if YENTREVE is co-administered with medicinal products that are \npredominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as \nnortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such \nas flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol). \n \nOral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: Results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine \ndoes not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A. Specific in vivo drug interaction studies have not \nbeen performed.  \n \nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: Caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined \nwith oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable \nto a pharmacodynamic interaction. Furthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when \nduloxetine was co-administered to patients treated with warfarin. However, concomitant \nadministration of duloxetine with warfarin under steady state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part \nof a clinical pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant change in INR from baseline \nor in the pharmacokinetics of R- or S-warfarin. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on duloxetine \nAntacids and H2 antagonists: Co-administration of YENTREVE with aluminium- and magnesium-\ncontaining antacids or with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine \nabsorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose. \n \nInducers of CYP1A2: Population pharmacokinetic studies analyses have shown that smokers have \nalmost 50% lower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nFertility \nIn animal studies, duloxetine had no effect on male fertility, and effects in females were only evident \nat doses that caused maternal toxicity. \n \nPregnancy  \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine \nlower than the maximum clinical exposure (see section 5.3). \n \nTwo large observational studies do not suggest an overall increased risk of major congenital \nmalformation (one from the US including 2,500 exposed to duloxetine during the first trimester and \none from the EU including 1,500 exposed to duloxetine during the first trimester). The analysis on \nspecific malformations such as cardiac malformations shows inconclusive results. \n \nIn the EU study, maternal exposure to duloxetine during late pregnancy (at any time from 20 weeks \ngestational age to delivery) was associated with an increased risk for preterm birth (less than 2-fold, \ncorresponding to approximately 6 additional premature births per 100 women treated with duloxetine \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nlate in pregnancy). The majority occurred between 35 and 36 weeks of gestation. This association was \nnot seen in the US study. \n \nThe US observational data have provided evidence of an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of \npostpartum haemorrhage following duloxetine exposure within the month prior to birth. \n \nEpidemiological data have suggested that the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, particularly in late \npregnancy, may increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN). \nAlthough no studies have investigated the association of PPHN to SNRI treatment, this potential risk \ncannot be ruled out with duloxetine taking into account the related mechanism of action (inhibition of \nthe re-uptake of serotonin).  \n \nAs with other serotonergic medicinal products, discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate \nafter maternal duloxetine use near term. Discontinuation symptoms seen with duloxetine may include \nhypotonia, tremor, jitteriness, feeding difficulty, respiratory distress and seizures. The majority of \ncases have occurred either at birth or within a few days of birth. \n \nYENTREVE should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus. Women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to \nbecome pregnant, during therapy.  \n \nBreast feeding \nDuloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did \nnot breast feed their children. The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately \n0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the \nuse of YENTREVE while breast-feeding is not recommended. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. YENTREVE \nmay be associated with sedation and dizziness. Patients should be instructed that if they experience \nsedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating \nmachinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with YENTREVE in clinical trials in \nSUI and other lower urinary tract disorders were nausea, dry mouth fatigue and constipation. The data \nanalysis of four 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with SUI, including 958 \nduloxetine-treated and 955 placebo-treated patients, showed that the onset of the reported adverse \nevents typically occurred in the first week of therapy. However, the majority of the most frequent \nadverse events were mild to moderate and resolved within 30 days of occurrence (e.g. nausea). \n \nb. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \nclinical trials. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions \nFrequency estimate: Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare \nInfections and infestations \n  Laryngitis   \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare \nImmune system disorders \n  Hyper-sensitivity \n\ndisorder \nAnaphylactic \nreaction \n\n \n\nEndocrine disorders \n  Hypo-thyroidism   \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n Appetite \n\ndecreased \nDehydration Hyperglycaemia \n\n(reported \nespecially in \ndiabetic patients) \nHyponatraemia \nSIADH6 \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n  Insomnia  \n\nAgitation \nLibido decreased \nAnxiety \nSleep disorder \n \n\nBruxism \nDisorientation \nApathy \nOrgasm abnormal \nAbnormal dreams \n\nSuicidal \nbehaviour5,6 \nSuicidal \nideation5,7 \nMania6 \nHallucinations \nAggression and \nanger4,6 \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n Headache \n\nDizziness \nLethargy \nSomnolence \nTremor \nParaesthesia \n\nNervousness \nDisturbance in \nattention \nDysgeusia \nPoor quality sleep \n \n\nSerotonin \nsyndrome6 \nConvulsions1,6 \nMyoclonus \nAkathisia6 \nPsychomotor \nrestlessness6 \nExtra-pyramidal \nsymptoms6 \nDyskinesia \nRestless legs \nsyndrome \n\n \n\nEye disorders \n Blurred vision Mydriasis \n\nVisual \nimpairment \nDry eye \n\nGlaucoma  \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n Vertigo Tinnitus1  \n\nEar pain \n  \n\nCardiac disorders \n  Palpitations \n\nTachycardia \nSupra-ventricular \narrhythmia, \nmainly atrial \nfibrillation6 \n\n \n\nVascular disorders \n Hypertension3,7 \n\nFlushing \nSyncope2 \nBlood pressure \nincrease3 \n\nHypertensive \ncrisis3 \nOrthostatic \nhypotension2 \nPeripheral \ncoldness \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare \n  Yawning  Throat tightness \n\nEpistaxis   \nInterstitial lung \ndisease10 \nEosinophilic \npneumonia6 \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nNausea  \nDry mouth  \nConstipation  \n\nDiarrhoea  \nAbdominal pain \nVomiting  \nDyspepsia \n\nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage7 \nGastroenteritis \nStomatitis \nEructation  \nGastritis \nDysphagia \nFlatulence  \nBreath odour \n\nHaematochezia \nMicroscopic \ncolitis9 \n \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n  Hepatitis3 \n\nElevated liver \nenzymes (ALT, \nAST, alkaline \nphosphatase) \nAcute liver injury \n\nHepatic failure6  \nJaundice6 \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Sweating \n\nincreased \nRash \nNight sweats  \nUrticaria  \nDermatitis \ncontact \nCold sweat \nIncreased \ntendency to \nbruise \n\nStevens-Johnson \nSyndrome6  \nAngio-neurotic \noedema6 \nPhoto-sensitivity \nreactions \n\nCutaneous \nvasculitis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n  Musculo-skeletal \n\npain \nMuscle tightness \nMuscle spasm  \nTrismus \n\nMuscle twitching  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n  Urinary hesitation \n\nDysuria \nNocturia \nPollakiuria \nUrine odour \nabnormal \n\nUrinary retention6 \nPolyuria \nUrine flow \ndecreased \n \n\n \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n  Gynaecological \n\nhaemorrhage  \nMenopausal \nsymptoms \n \n\nMenstrual \ndisorder  \nGalactorrhoea \nHyperprolactinae\nmia \nPostpartum \nhaemorrhage6 \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare \nFatigue  Asthenia \n\nChills \nChest pain7 \nFalls8 \nFeeling abnormal  \nFeeling cold  \nThirst \nMalaise \nFeeling hot \n\nGait disturbance  \n\nInvestigations \n  Weight decrease \n\nWeight increase \nBlood cholesterol \nincreased \nBlood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased \n\nBlood potassium \nincreased \n\n \n\n \n\n1 Cases of convulsion and cases of tinnitus have also been reported after treatment discontinuation. \n2 Cases of orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of \n\ntreatment. \n3 See section 4.4. \n4 Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment or after treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n5 Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or \n\nearly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n6 Estimated frequency of post-marketing surveillance reported adverse reactions; not observed in \n\nplacebo-controlled clinical trials. \n7 Not statistically significantly different from placebo. \n8 Falls were more common in the elderly (≥65 years old). \n9 Estimated frequency based on all clinical trial data. \n10Estimated frequency based on placebo-controlled clinical trials. \n \nc. Description of selected adverse reactions \nDiscontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. \nDizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia or electric shock-like sensations, particularly \nin the head), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), fatigue, somnolence, \nagitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, myalgia, irritability, diarrhoea, \nhyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. \n \nGenerally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in \nsome patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when duloxetine \ntreatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nThe heart rate-corrected QT interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in \nplacebo-treated patients. No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or \nQTcB measurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. \n \nIn the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic \npain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-\ntreated patients. HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the \nextension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both \nthe duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-\ntreated group. There was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in \nduloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care \ngroup.  \n \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of \n5400 mg were reported. Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with \nduloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg. Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine \nalone or in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin \nsyndrome, seizures, vomiting and tachycardia.   \n \nNo specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment \n(such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. A free airway should be \nestablished. Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate \nsymptomatic and supportive measures. Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after \ningestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. \nDuloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange \nperfusion are unlikely to be beneficial. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antidepressants. ATC code: N06AX21. \n \nMechanism of action \nDuloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor. It weakly \ninhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic \nand adrenergic receptors.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn animal studies, increased levels of 5-HT and NE in the sacral spinal cord, lead to increased urethral \ntone via enhanced pudendal nerve stimulation to the urethral striated sphincter muscle only during the \nstorage phase of the micturition cycle. A similar mechanism in women is believed to result in stronger \nurethral closure during urine storage with physical stress that could explain the efficacy of duloxetine \nin the treatment of women with SUI.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of SUI was established in four \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with SUI; of \nthese, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo. The primary efficacy measures \nwere Incontinence Episode Frequency (IEF) from diaries and an incontinence specific quality of life \nquestionnaire score (I-QOL). \n \nIncontinence Episode Frequency: In all four studies the duloxetine-treated group had a 50% or greater \nmedian decrease in IEF compared with 33% in the placebo-treated group. Differences were observed \nat each visit after 4 weeks (duloxetine 54% and placebo 22%), 8 weeks (52% and 29%), and 12 weeks \n(52% and 33%) of medication.  \n \nIn an additional study limited to patients with severe SUI, all responses with duloxetine were achieved \nwithin 2 weeks.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 13 \n\nThe efficacy of YENTREVE has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled \nstudies. The clinical benefit of YENTREVE compared with placebo has not been demonstrated in \nwomen with mild SUI, defined in randomised trials as those with IEF < 14 per week. In these women, \nYENTREVE may provide no benefit beyond that afforded by more conservative behavioural \ninterventions. \n \nQuality of Life: Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) questionnaire scores were significantly \nimproved in the duloxetine-treated patient group compared with the placebo-treated group (9.2 versus \n5.9 score improvement, p<0.001). Using a global improvement scale (PGI), significantly more women \nusing duloxetine considered their symptoms of stress incontinence to be improved with treatment \ncompared with women using placebo (64.6% versus 50.1%, p<0.001). \n \nYENTREVE and Prior Continence Surgery: There are limited data that suggest that the benefits of \nYENTREVE are not diminished in women with stress urinary incontinence who have previously \nundergone continence surgery. \n \nYENTREVE and Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT): During a 12-week blinded, randomised, \ncontrolled study, YENTREVE demonstrated greater reductions in IEF compared with either placebo \ntreatment or with PFMT alone. Combined therapy (duloxetine + PFMT) showed greater improvement \nin both pad use and condition-specific quality of life measures than YENTREVE alone or PFMT \nalone. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nYentreve in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. See \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDuloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative \nenzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation. The pharmacokinetics of \nduloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, \nsmoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status.  \n \nAbsorption: Duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post \ndose. The absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). Food \ndelays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the \nextent of absorption (approximately 11 %). These changes do not have any clinical significance.  \n \nDistribution: Duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. Duloxetine binds to \nboth albumin and alpha-l acid glycoprotein. Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nBiotransformation: Duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally \nin urine. Both cytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites \nglucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulfate conjugate of 5-hydroxy 6-methoxy \nduloxetine. Based upon in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered \npharmacologically inactive. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers \nwith respect to CYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated. Limited data suggest that the plasma \nlevels of duloxetine are higher in these patients. \n \nElimination: The elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). \nAfter an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of \n36 l/hr). After an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr \n(mean 101 l/hr). \n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nSpecial populations \nGender: Pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent \nplasma clearance is approximately 50% lower in females). Based upon the overlap in the range of \nclearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a \nlower dose for female patients.  \n \nAge: Pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) \n(AUC increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the magnitude \nof these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. As a general recommendation, \ncaution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment: End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher \nduloxetine Cmax and AUC values compared with healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine \nis limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment: Moderate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of \nduloxetine. Compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% \nlower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in \npatients with moderate liver disease. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not \nbeen studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency. \n \nBreast-feeding mothers: The disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at \nleast 12-weeks postpartum. Duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in \nbreast milk are about one-fourth those in plasma. The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is \napproximately 7 µg/day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing. Lactation did not influence duloxetine \npharmacokinetics.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.  \nMultinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat \ncarcinogenicity study. The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.  Female \nmice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and \ncarcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to \nhepatic microsomal enzyme induction. The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. \nFemale rats receiving duloxetine before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in \nmaternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices \nand progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at \nthe most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC). In an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher \nincidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels \nbelow the maximum clinical exposure (AUC). No malformations were observed in another study \ntesting a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. In pre/postnatal toxicity study in the rat, \nduloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at systemic exposure levels below \nmaximum clinical exposure (AUC).  \n \nStudies in juvenile rats reveal transient effects on neurobehaviour, as well as significantly decreased \nbody weight and food consumption; hepatic enzyme induction; and hepatocellular vacuolation at 45 \nmg/kg/day. The general toxicity profile of duloxetine in juvenile rats was similar to that in adult rats. \nThe no-adverse effect level was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day.  \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nPackage leaflet: information for the user \n \n\nYENTREVE 40 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules \nYENTREVE 20 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules \n\nDuloxetine (as hydrochloride) \n \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any of the side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What YENTREVE is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take YENTREVE \n3. How to take YENTREVE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store YENTREVE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What YENTREVE is and what it is used for \n \nYENTREVE contains the active substance duloxetine. YENTREVE increases the levels of serotonin \nand noradrenaline in the nervous system. \n \nYENTREVE is a medicine to be taken by mouth to treat Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) in women. \n \nStress urinary incontinence is a medical condition in which patients have accidental loss or leakage of \nurine during physical exertion or activities such as laughing, coughing, sneezing, lifting, or exercise. \n \nYENTREVE is believed to work by increasing the strength of the muscle that holds back urine when \nyou laugh, sneeze, or perform physical activities. \n \nThe efficacy of YENTREVE is reinforced when combined with a training program called Pelvic Floor \nMuscle Training (PFMT). \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you take YENTREVE \n \nDO NOT take YENTREVE if you: \n- are allergic to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n- have liver disease \n- have severe kidney disease \n- are taking or have taken within the last 14 days, another medicine known as a monoamine oxidase \n\ninhibitor (MAOI) (see ‘Other medicines and YENTREVE’) \n- are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin which \n\nare used to treat some infections \nTalk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. Your doctor will tell you if you \nshould be taking YENTREVE. \n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nWarnings and Precautions \nThe following are reasons why YENTREVE may not be suitable for you. Talk to your doctor before \nyou take Yentreve if you: \n- are taking medicines to treat depression (see ‘Other medicines and YENTREVE’) \n- are taking St. John’s Wort, a herbal treatment (Hypericum perforatum) \n- have kidney disease \n- have had seizures (fits) \n- have had mania \n- suffer from bipolar disorder \n- have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) \n- have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises), especially if you are \n\npregnant (see ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding‘) \n- are at risk of low sodium levels (for example if you are taking diuretics, especially if you are \n\nelderly) \n- are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage. \n- are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see ‘Other medicines and YENTREVE’) \n \nYENTREVE may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still. You should tell \nyour doctor if this happens to you. \n \nMedicines like Yentreve (so called SSRIs/SNRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see \nsection 4). In some cases, these symptoms have continued after stopping treatment. \n \nThoughts of suicide and worsening of depression or anxiety disorder  \nAlthough YENTREVE is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient \n(duloxetine) is used as an antidepressant medicine. If you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders \nyou can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. These may be increased when first \nstarting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but \nsometimes longer. \nYou may be more likely to think like this if you:  \n- have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself \n- are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal \n\nbehaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an \nantidepressant \n\n \nIf you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a \nhospital straight away. \nYou may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety \ndisorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression \nor anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. \n \nChildren and adolescents under 18 years of age \nYENTREVE should not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. Also, you should know \nthat patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts \nand hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when they take this class \nof medicines. Also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, maturation, and cognitive and \nbehavioural development of YENTREVE in this age group have not yet been demonstrated. \n \nOther medicines and YENTREVE \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.  \n \nThe main ingredient of YENTREVE, duloxetine, is used in other medicines for other conditions: \n• diabetic neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence \nUsing more than one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided. Check with your doctor if \nyou are already taking other medicines containing duloxetine. \n \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nYour doctor should decide whether you can take YENTREVE with other medicines. Do not start or \nstop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, \nbefore checking with your doctor.  \n \nYou should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): You should not take YENTREVE if you are taking or have \nrecently taken (within the last 14 days) an antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase \ninhibitor (MAOI). Examples of MAOIs include moclobemide (an antidepressant) and linezolid (an \nantibiotic).  Taking a MAOI together with many prescription medicines, including YENTREVE, can \ncause serious or even life-threatening side effects. You must wait at least 14 days after you have \nstopped taking an MAOI before you can take YENTREVE. Also, you need to wait at least 5 days after \nyou stop taking YENTREVE before you take a MAOI. \n \nMedicines that cause sleepiness: These include medicines prescribed by your doctor including \nbenzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital and sedative antihistamines. \n \nMedicines that increase the level of serotonin: Triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, SSRIs (such as \nparoxetine and fluoxetine), SNRIs (such as venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (such as \nclomipramine, amitriptyline), pethidine, St John’s Wort and MAOIs (such as moclobemide and \nlinezolid). These medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking \nany of these medicines together with YENTREVE, you should see your doctor.  \n \nOral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents: Medicines which thin the blood or prevent the blood from \nclotting. These medicines might increase the risk of bleeding. \n \nYENTREVE with food, drink and alcohol \nYENTREVE may be taken with or without food. You should take extra care if you drink alcohol while \ntaking YENTREVE.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n• Tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are \n\ntaking YENTREVE. You should use YENTREVE only after discussing the potential benefits \nand any potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor. \n\n  \n• Make sure your midwife and/or doctor knows you are on YENTREVE. When taken during \n\npregnancy, similar drugs (SSRIs) may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, called \npersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making the baby breathe faster and \nappear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby is born. If \nthis happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor immediately. \n\n \n• If you take YENTREVE near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some symptoms \n\nwhen it is born. These usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being born. \nThese symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, \ntrouble with breathing and fits. If your baby has any of these symptoms when it is born, or you \nare concerned about your baby’s health, contact your doctor or midwife who will be able to \nadvise you. \n \n\n• If you take YENTREVE near the end of your pregnancy there is an increased risk of excessive \nvaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding disorders. Your \ndoctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking duloxetine so they can advise you. \n \n\n• Available data from the use of YENTREVE during the first three months of pregnancy do not \nshow an increased risk of overall birth defects in general in the child. If YENTREVE is taken \nduring the second half of pregnancy, there may be an increased risk that the infant will be born \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nearly (6 additional premature infants for every 100 women who take YENTREVE in the second \nhalf of pregnancy), mostly between weeks 35 and 36 of pregnancy. \n\n \n• Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. The use of YENTREVE while breastfeeding is not \n\nrecommended. You should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYENTREVE may make you feel sleepy or dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you \nknow how YENTREVE affects you. \n \nYENTREVE contains sucrose \nYENTREVE contains sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to \nsome sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.  \n \nYENTREVE contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3.  How to take YENTREVE \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nYENTREVE is for oral use. You should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water. \n \nThe recommended dose of YENTREVE is 40 mg twice a day (in the morning and late \nafternoon/evening). Your doctor may decide to start your treatment with 20 mg twice a day for two \nweeks before increasing the dose to 40 mg twice a day.  \n \nTo help you remember to take YENTREVE, you may find it easier to take it at the same times every \nday.  \n \nDo not stop taking YENTREVE, or change your dose, without talking to your doctor. Treating your \ndisorder properly is important to help you get better.  If it is not treated, your condition may not go \naway and may become more serious and difficult to treat. \n \nIf you take more YENTREVE than you should \nCall your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of YENTREVE \nprescribed by your doctor. Symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, serotonin syndrome (a \nrare reaction which may cause feelings of great happiness, drowsiness, clumsiness, restlessness, \nfeeling of being drunk, fever, sweating or rigid muscles), fits, vomiting and fast heart rate. \n \nIf you forget to take YENTREVE \nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the \nmissed dose and take only a single dose as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \ndose. Do not take more than the daily amount of YENTREVE that has been prescribed for you in one \nday. \n \nIf you stop taking YENTREVE \nDO NOT stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. If your \ndoctor thinks that you no longer need YENTREVE he or she will ask you to reduce your dose over 2 \nweeks.  \n \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nSome patients, who suddenly stop taking YENTREVE after more than 1 week of therapy, have had \nsymptoms such as:  \n• dizziness, tingling feelings like pins and needles or electric shock-like feelings (particularly in \n\nthe head), sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), fatigue, sleepiness, \nfeeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), \nshaking (tremor), headaches, muscle pain, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or \nvertigo.  \n\nThese symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a few days, but if you have symptoms \nthat are troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \nIf you have further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
