NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNyxoid 1.8 mg nasal spray, solution in a single-dose container \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach nasal spray container delivers 1.8 mg of naloxone (as hydrochloride dihydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nNasal spray, solution in a single-dose container (nasal spray) \n \nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNyxoid is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy for known or suspected opioid \noverdose as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression in both non-medical \nand healthcare settings. \n \nNyxoid is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 14 years and over. \n \nNyxoid is not a substitute for emergency medical care. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 14 years and over \n \nThe recommended dose is 1.8 mg administered into one nostril (one nasal spray).   \n \nIn some cases, further doses may be necessary.  The appropriate maximum dose of Nyxoid is situation \nspecific.  If the patient does not respond, the second dose should be administered after 2-3 minutes.  If \nthe patient responds to the first administration but then relapses again into respiratory depression, the \nsecond dose should be administered immediately.  Further doses (if available) should be administered \nin alternate nostrils and the patient should be monitored whilst awaiting arrival of the emergency \nservices.  Emergency services may administer further doses according to local guidelines. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Nyxoid in children below 14 years has not been established.  No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNasal use.   \n \nNyxoid should be administered as soon as possible to avoid damage to the central nervous system or \ndeath.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nNyxoid contains only one dose and therefore it must not be primed or tested prior to administration. \n \nDetailed instructions on how to use Nyxoid are provided in the Package Leaflet and a Quick Start \nGuide is printed on the back of each blister.  In addition, training is provided via a video and a Patient \nInformation Card. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInstructing patients / users on the proper use of Nyxoid  \n \nNyxoid should only be made available once the suitability and competence of an individual to \nadminister naloxone in the appropriate circumstances has been established.  Patients or any other \nperson who might be in a position to administer Nyxoid must be instructed in its proper use and the \nimportance of seeking medical assistance. \n \nNyxoid is not a substitute for emergency medical care and may be used instead of intravenous (IV) \ninjection, when IV access is not immediately available.   \n \nNyxoid is intended to be administered as a part of a resuscitation intervention in suspected overdose \ncasualties, where opioid drugs may be involved or suspected, likely in a non-medical setting.  \nTherefore, the prescriber should take appropriate steps to ensure that the patient and/or any other \nperson who might be in a position to administer Nyxoid thoroughly understands the indications and \nuse of Nyxoid.   \n \nThe prescriber should describe the symptoms which allow presumptive diagnosis of central nervous \nsystem (CNS) / respiratory depression, the indication and the instructions for use with the patient and / \nor person who might be in a position to administer this product to a patient experiencing a known or \nsuspected opioid overdose event.  This should be performed in accordance with the educational \nguidance for Nyxoid. \n \nMonitoring of the patient for a response  \n \nPatients who respond satisfactorily to Nyxoid must be closely monitored.  The effect of some opioids \ncan be longer than the effect of naloxone, which could lead to reoccurrence of respiratory depression \nand therefore further doses of naloxone may be required. \n \nOpioid withdrawal syndrome  \n \nReceiving Nyxoid can lead to a rapid reversal of the opioid effect which can cause an acute \nwithdrawal syndrome (see section 4.8).  Patients who are receiving opioids for the relief of chronic \npain may experience pain and opioid withdrawal symptoms when Nyxoid is administered. \n \nEffectiveness of naloxone \n \nReversal of buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression may be incomplete.  If an incomplete \nresponse occurs, respiration should be mechanically assisted. \n \nIntranasal absorption and efficacy of naloxone can be altered in patients with damaged nasal mucosa \nand septal defects. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nOpioid withdrawal may be life-threatening in neonates if not recognised and properly treated and may \ninclude the following signs and symptoms: convulsions, excessive crying and hyperactive reflexes.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNaloxone elicits a pharmacological response due to the interaction with opioids and opioid agonists.  \nWhen administered to opioid dependent subjects, naloxone can cause acute withdrawal symptoms in \nsome individuals.  Hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema and cardiac arrest have been \ndescribed, more typically when naloxone is used post-operatively (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nAdministration of Nyxoid may decrease the analgesic effects of opioids used primarily to provide pain \nrelief, due to its antagonist properties (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen administering naloxone to patients who have received buprenorphine as an analgesic, complete \nanalgesia may be restored.  It is thought that this effect is a result of the arch-shaped dose-response \ncurve of buprenorphine with decreasing analgesia in the event of high doses.  However, reversal of \nrespiratory depression caused by buprenorphine is limited. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of naloxone in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity only at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3).  The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown.  Nyxoid should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the \nwoman requires treatment with naloxone. \n \nIn pregnant women who have been treated with Nyxoid, the fetus should be monitored for signs of \ndistress. \n \nIn opioid dependent pregnant women, naloxone administration can cause withdrawal symptoms in \nnewborn infants (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether naloxone is excreted in human breast milk and it has not been established \nwhether infants who are breast-fed are affected by naloxone.  However, as naloxone is practically not \norally bioavailable its potential to affect a breast-fed infant is negligible.  Caution should be exercised \nwhen naloxone is administered to a breast-feeding mother but there is no need to discontinue \nbreast-feeding.  Breast-fed babies from mothers who have been treated with Nyxoid should be \nmonitored to check for sedation or irritability. \n \nFertility \n \nNo clinical data on effects of naloxone on fertility are available, however data from rat studies (see \nsection 5.3) indicate no effects.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients who have received naloxone to reverse the effects of opioids should be warned not to drive, to \noperate machinery or to engage in other activities demanding physical or mental exertion for at least \n24 hours, since the effect of the opioids may return. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse drug reaction (ADR) seen with naloxone administration is nausea \n(frequency very common).  Typical opioid withdrawal syndrome is expected with naloxone which \nmay be caused by the abrupt withdrawal of opioid in persons physically dependent on them.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with Nyxoid and/or other naloxone-containing \nmedicinal products during clinical studies and post marketing experience.  ADRs are listed below by \nsystem organ class and frequency.   \n \nFrequency categories are assigned to those adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly causally \nrelated to naloxone and are defined as very common: (≥ 1/10); common: (≥ 1/100, < 1/10); \nuncommon: (≥ 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare: (≥ 1/10,000, < 1/1,000) very rare: (< 1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n  \nImmune system disorders  \n \nVery rare:  Hypersensitivity, Anaphylactic shock \n \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nCommon  Dizziness, Headache \n \nUncommon  Tremor \n \nCardiac disorders \n \nCommon  Tachycardia \n \nUncommon  Arrhythmia, Bradycardia \n \nVery rare  Cardiac fibrillation, Cardiac arrest \n \nVascular disorders \n \nCommon  Hypotension, Hypertension \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nUncommon  Hyperventilation \n \nVery rare  Pulmonary oedema \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nVery common Nausea \n \nCommon  Vomiting \n \nUncommon  Diarrhoea, Dry mouth \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nUncommon  Hyperhidrosis \n \nVery rare  Erythema multiforme \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nUncommon  Drug withdrawal syndrome (in patients dependent on opioids) \n \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDrug withdrawal syndrome \n \nSigns and symptoms of drug withdrawal syndrome include restlessness, irritability, hyperaesthesia, \nnausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal pain, muscle spasms, dysphoria, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, \npiloerection, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, yawning, pyrexia.  Behavioural changes including \nviolent behaviour, nervousness and excitement may also be observed. \n \nVascular disorders \n \nIn reports on intravenous/intramuscular naloxone: hypotension, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia \n(including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation) and pulmonary oedema have occurred with the \npostoperative use of naloxone.  Adverse cardiovascular effects have occurred more frequently in \npostoperative patients with a pre-existing cardiovascular disease or in those receiving other medicines \nthat produce similar adverse cardiovascular effects. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNyxoid is intended for use in adolescents 14 years and over.  Frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions in adolescents are expected to be the same as in adults.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn view of the indication and the broad therapeutic margin, overdose is not to be expected.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antidotes, ATC code: V03AB15 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nNaloxone, a semisynthetic morphine derivative (N-allyl-nor-oxymorphone), is a specific opioid \nantagonist that acts competitively at opioid receptors.  It reveals very high affinity for the opioid \nreceptor sites and therefore displaces both opioid agonists and partial antagonists.  Naloxone does not \npossess the \"agonistic\" or morphine-like properties characteristic of other opioid antagonists.  In the \n\n\n\n7 \n\nabsence of opioids or agonistic effects of other opioid antagonists, it exhibits essentially no \npharmacologic activity.  Naloxone has not been shown to produce tolerance or cause physical or \nmental dependence.  \n \nAs the duration of action of some opioid agonists may be longer than that of naloxone, the effects of \nthe opioid agonist may return as the effects of naloxone disappear.  This may necessitate repeat doses \nof naloxone – though the need for repeat naloxone doses is dependent on the quantity, type and route \nof administration of the opioid agonist that is being treated.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo data are available. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nIntranasal administration of naloxone has demonstrated naloxone to be rapidly absorbed, as evidenced \nby very early appearance (as early as 1 minute after administration) of the active substance in systemic \ncirculation.  \n \nA study investigating intranasal naloxone at doses of 1, 2, 4 mg (MR903-1501) shows that the \nmedian (range) tmax associated with intranasal administration of naloxone was 15 (10, 60) minutes for \n1 mg, 30 (8, 60) minutes for 2 mg and 15 (10, 60) minutes for 4 mg intranasal doses.  Onset of action \nfollowing intranasal administration can reasonably be expected to occur in each individual before the \ntmax is reached. \n \nThe half value duration (HVD) values for intranasal administration were longer than for IM \nadministration (intranasal, 2 mg, 1.27h, IM, 0.4 mg 1.09h) from which we can infer a longer duration \nof action of naloxone given by the intranasal rather than the IM route.  If the duration of action of the \nopioid agonist exceeds that of intranasal naloxone, the effects of the opioid agonist may return, \nnecessitating a second intranasal naloxone administration. \n \nA study demonstrated mean absolute bioavailability of 47% and mean half-lives of 1.4 h from \nintranasal doses of 2 mg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nNaloxone is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.  It undergoes extensive hepatic \nmetabolism mainly by glucuronide conjugation.  The principal metabolites are \nnaloxone-3-glucuronide, 6-beta-naloxol and its glucuronide.  \n \nElimination \n \nThere are no data available on the excretion of naloxone following intranasal administration, however, \nthe disposition of labelled naloxone following IV administration was studied in healthy volunteers and \nopioid-dependent patients.  Following an IV dose of 125 µg, 38% of the dose was recovered in the \nurine within 6 hours in healthy volunteers compared with 25% of the dose being recovered in \nopioid-dependent patients in the same time period.  After a period of 72 hours, 65% of the injected \ndose was recovered in urine in the healthy volunteers compared with 68% of the dose in \nopiate-dependent patients.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo data are available. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \n \nNaloxone was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, but was positive in mouse \nlymphoma assay and was clastogenic in vitro, however, naloxone was not clastogenic in vivo.  \nNaloxone was not carcinogenic following oral administration in a rat 2-year study or in a 26-week \nstudy in Tg-rasH2 mice.  Overall, the weight of evidence indicates that naloxone poses minimal, if \nany, risk for human genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. \n \nReproductive and developmental toxicity \n \nNaloxone had no effect on fertility and reproduction in the rat or on early embryonic development of \nthe rat and rabbit.  In peri-post natal rat studies, naloxone produced increased pup deaths in the \nimmediate post-partum period at the high doses that also caused significant maternal toxicity in rats \n(e.g. bodyweight loss, convulsions).

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNyxoid 1.8 mg nasal spray, solution in a single-dose container  \nNaloxone \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Nyxoid is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Nyxoid \n3. How Nyxoid is to be given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Nyxoid \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Nyxoid is and what it is used for \n \nThis medicine contains the active substance naloxone.  Naloxone temporarily reverses the effects of \nopioids such as heroin, methadone, fentanyl, oxycodone, buprenorphine and morphine. \n \nNyxoid is a nasal spray used for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose or possible opioid \noverdose in adults and adolescents over 14 years.  Signs of overdose include:  \n• breathing problems  \n• severe sleepiness  \n• not responding to a loud noise or touch. \n \nIf you are at risk of an opioid overdose you should always carry your Nyxoid with you. Nyxoid \nworks for a short time only to reverse the effects of opioids while you wait for emergency medical \nattention.  It is not a substitute for emergency medical care.  Nyxoid is intended for use by \nappropriately trained individuals.   \n \nAlways tell your friends and family that you carry Nyxoid with you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Nyxoid \n \nDo not use Nyxoid  \n \nIf you are allergic to naloxone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nNyxoid will be supplied to you only after you or your carer have been taught how to use it. \n \nIt is to be given right away and does not take the place of emergency medical care.   \n \n• Emergency services should be called if an opioid overdose is suspected. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nThe signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose can return after this nasal spray is given.  If this \nhappens, further doses may be given after 2 to 3 minutes using a new nasal spray.  The patient should \nbe monitored closely until emergency help has arrived after being given this medicine. \n \nConditions to look out for \n• If you are physically dependent on opioids or if you have received high doses of opioids (for \n\nexample heroin, methadone, fentanyl, oxycodone, buprenorphine or morphine).  You may get \nstrong withdrawal symptoms with this medicine (see later in section 4 of this leaflet under \n‘Conditions to look out for’) \n\n• If you take opioids to control pain.  The pain may increase when you receive Nyxoid. \n• If you use buprenorphine.  Nyxoid may not fully reverse breathing problems. \n \nTell your doctor if you have damage to the inside of your nose as this could affect how Nyxoid \nworks. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nNyxoid is not for use in children or adolescents under 14 years.  \n \nReceiving Nyxoid close to giving birth \n \nTell your midwife or doctor if you have received Nyxoid close to or during labour. \nYour baby could suffer from sudden opioid withdrawal syndrome, which could be life-threatening if \nnot treated. \nWatch out for the following symptoms in your baby during the first 24 hours after the baby is born:  \n• seizures (fits) \n• crying more than usual \n• increased reflexes. \n \nOther medicines and Nyxoid \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nPregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving a supply of this medicine. \nIf you are given Nyxoid while you are pregnant or breast-feeding, your baby should be closely \nmonitored. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAfter taking this medicine, you must not drive, operate machinery or engage in any other physically or \nmentally demanding activity for at least 24 hours, since the effects of opioids may recur.  \n \n \n3. How Nyxoid is to be given \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you.  Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nTraining will be provided on how to use Nyxoid before it is supplied to you.  Below is a step by step \nguide. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nInstructions for giving Nyxoid nasal spray:  \n \n1. Check for symptoms and response.   \n\n- Check for a response, to see if the person is conscious.  You can shout their name, \ngently shake their shoulders, talk loudly into their ears, rub their breastbone (sternum), \npinch their ear or the bed of their fingernail. \n\n- Check airways and breathing.  Clear the mouth and nose of any blockages.  For \n10 seconds check for breathing – is the chest moving?  Can you hear breathing sounds?  \nCan you feel breath on the cheek? \n\n- Check for signs of overdose, such as: no response to touch or sounds, slow uneven \nbreathing or no breathing, snoring, gasping or gulping, blue or purple fingernails or lips. \n\n- If an overdose is suspected Nyxoid should be given. \n \n2. Call for an ambulance.  Nyxoid is not a substitute for emergency medical care. \n \n\n \n \n3. Peel off the back of the blister from the corner to remove the nasal spray from the container.  \n\nPlace the nasal spray within easy reach. \n \n\n \n \n4. Lay the patient on their back. Support the back of the neck and allow the head to tilt back.  \n\nClear away anything blocking their nose. \n \n\n \n \n5. Hold the nasal spray with your thumb on the bottom of the plunger and your first and middle \n\nfingers on either side of the nozzle.  Do not prime or test the Nyxoid nasal spray before use \nas it contains only one dose of naloxone and cannot be reused. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n6. Gently insert the device nozzle in one nostril.  Press firmly on the plunger until it clicks to \ngive the dose.  Remove the nasal spray nozzle from the nostril after giving the dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n7. Place the patient into the recovery position on their side with mouth open pointing towards the \n\nground and stay with the patient until the emergency services arrive.  Watch for an \nimprovement in the patient’s breathing level, alertness and response to noise and touch.   \n\n \n\n \n \n8. If the patient is no better within 2-3 minutes, a second dose can be given.  Be aware – even if \n\nthey wake up, they may become unconscious again, and stop breathing.  If this happens, a \nsecond dose can be given immediately.  Give Nyxoid in the other nostril using a new Nyxoid \nnasal spray.  This can be done while the patient is in the recovery position.   \n\n \n9. If the patient does not respond to two doses, further doses may be given (if available).  Stay \n\nwith the patient and continue to watch for an improvement until the emergency services arrive \nwho will give further treatment. \n\n \nIn patients who are unconscious and not breathing normally additional life-saving support should be \ngiven if possible.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects although not everyone gets them.
