CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSynjardy is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and \nexercise:\n in patients insufficiently controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone\n in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, in patients \n\ninsufficiently controlled with metformin and these medicinal products\n in patients already being treated with the combination of empagliflozin and metformin as \n\nseparate tablets.\n\nFor study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, \nand the population studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nAdults with normal renal function (GFR ≥90 ml/min)\n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet twice daily. The dosage should be individualised on the basis of \nthe patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability using the recommended daily dose of \n10 mg or 25 mg of empagliflozin, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of \nmetformin.\n\nFor patients insufficiently controlled on metformin (either alone or in combination with other \nmedicinal products for the treatment of diabetes)\n\nIn patients insufficiently controlled on metformin alone or in combination with other medicinal \nproducts for the treatment of diabetes, the recommended starting dose of Synjardy should provide\nempagliflozin 5 mg twice daily (10 mg daily dose) and the dose of metformin similar to the dose\nalready being taken. In patients tolerating a total daily dose of empagliflozin 10 mg and who need \ntighter glycaemic control, the dose can be increased to a total daily dose of empagliflozin 25 mg. \nWhen Synjardy is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin, a lower dose of \nsulphonylurea and/or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (see sections 4.5 and \n4.8). \n\nFor patients switching from separate tablets of empagliflozin and metformin\n\nPatients switching from separate tablets of empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg total daily dose) and \nmetformin to Synjardy should receive the same daily dose of empagliflozin and metformin already \nbeing taken or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose of metformin (for available strengths see \nsection 2).\n\nMissed dose\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers; however, a double dose \nshould not be taken on the same time. In that case, the missed dose should be skipped.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment. A GFR should be \nassessed before initiation of treatment with metformin containing products and at least annually \nthereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in the elderly, \nrenal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every 3-6 months.\n\n\n\n4\n\nIf no adequate strength of Synjardy is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead of \nthe fixed dose combination.\n\nTable 1: Posology for renally impaired patients\nGFR ml/min Metformin Empagliflozin\n60-89 Maximum daily dose is 3000 mg.\n\nDose reduction may be considered in \nrelation to declining renal function.\n\nMaximum daily dose is 25 mg.\n\n45-59 Maximum daily dose is 2000 mg.\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose.\n\nEmpagliflozin should not be initiated.\nThe dose should be adjusted to or \nmaintained at a maximum daily dose of \n10 mg.\n\n30-44 Maximum daily dose is 1000 mg.\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose.\n\nEmpagliflozin is not recommended.\n\n<30 Metformin is contraindicated. Empagliflozin is not recommended.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThis medicinal product must not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and \n5.2).\n\nElderly \nDue to the mechanism of action, decreased renal function will result in reduced glycaemic efficacy of \nempagliflozin. Because metformin is excreted by the kidney and elderly patients are more likely to \nhave decreased renal function, Synjardy should be used with caution in these patients. Monitoring of \nrenal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in \nelderly patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). In patients 75 years and older, an increased risk for volume \ndepletion should be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Due to the limited therapeutic \nexperience with empagliflozin in patients aged 85 years and older, initiation of therapy in this \npopulation is not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Synjardy in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years has not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nSynjardy should be taken twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse reactions\nassociated with metformin. All patients should continue their diet with an adequate distribution of \ncarbohydrate intake during the day. Overweight patients should continue their energy restricted diet. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis) (see section\n\n4.4).\n Diabetic pre-coma.\n Severe renal failure (GFR <30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: dehydration, severe infection, \n\nshock (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n Disease which may cause tissue hypoxia (especially acute disease, or worsening of chronic \n\ndisease) such as: decompensated heart failure, respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction, \nshock (see section 4.4).\n\n Hepatic impairment, acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nLactic acidosis\n\nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening \nof renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute \nworsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis.\n\nIn case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever or reduced fluid intake), metformin should \nbe temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended.\n\nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and \nNSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic \nacidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, \nprolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal \nproducts that may cause lactic acidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia followed \nby coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and seek \nimmediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (<7.35), \nincreased plasma lactate levels (>5 mmol/l) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. \n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\n\nRare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been \nreported in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. In a number of cases, the \npresentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below \n14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl). It is not known if DKA is more likely to occur with higher doses of \nempagliflozin.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level. \n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with empagliflozin should be \ndiscontinued immediately. \n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with empagliflozin may be restarted when the \nketone values are normal and the patient’s condition has stabilised.\n\nBefore initiating empagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis \nshould be considered.\n\nPatients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g. \ntype 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or \npatients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or \nsevere dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin \nrequirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used \nwith caution in these patients.\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and \nempagliflozin should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. Limited data from \nclinical trials suggest that DKA occurs with common frequency when patients with type 1 diabetes are \ntreated with SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nAdministration of iodinated contrast agent\n\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin should be \ndiscontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and \n4.5).\n\nRenal function\n\nDue to the mechanism of action, decreased renal function will result in reduced glycaemic efficacy of \nempagliflozin. GFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter, see section \n4.2. Synjardy is contraindicated in patients with GFR<30 ml/min and should be temporarily \ndiscontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3).\n\nCardiac function\n\nPatients with heart failure are more at risk of hypoxia and renal insufficiency. In patients with stable \nchronic heart failure, Synjardy may be used with a regular monitoring of cardiac and renal function. \nFor patients with acute and unstable heart failure, Synjardy is contraindicated due to the metformin \ncomponent (see section 4.3).\n\nSurgery\n\nMetformin must be discontinued at the time of surgery under general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia. \nTherapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition \nand provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.\n\nRisk for volume depletion\n\nBased on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying therapeutic \nglucosuria may lead to a modest decrease in blood pressure (see section 5.1). Therefore, caution \nshould be exercised in patients for whom a empagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a \nrisk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a \nhistory of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older.\n\nIn case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of \nvolume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including \nhaematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving Synjardy. Temporary interruption \nof treatment with Synjardy should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.\n\nElderly \n\nThe effect of empagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which \ncould affect the hydration status. Patients aged 75 years and older may be at an increased risk of \nvolume depletion. Therefore, special attention should be given to their volume intake in case of co-\nadministered medicinal products which may lead to volume depletion (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors). \nTherapeutic experience in patients aged 85 years and older is limited. Initiation of therapy in this \npopulation is not recommended (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n7\n\nUrinary tract infections\n\nPost marketing cases of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis and urosepsis \nhave been reported in patients treated with empagliflozin (see section 4.8). Temporary interruption of \ntreatment should be considered in patients with complicated urinary tract infections.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene)\n\nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), \nhave been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but serious and \npotentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment.\n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier´s \ngangrene is suspected, Synjardy should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics \nand surgical debridement) should be instituted.\n\nLower limb amputations\n\nAn increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in long-term\nclinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. \nLike for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot-care.\n\nHepatic injury\n\nCases of hepatic injury have been reported with empagliflozin in clinical trials. A causal relationship \nbetween empagliflozin and hepatic injury has not been established.\n\nCardiac failure\n\nExperience in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II is limited, and there is no experience in \nclinical studies with empagliflozin in NYHA class III-IV. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, \n10.1% of the patients were reported with cardiac failure at baseline. The reduction of cardiovascular\ndeath in these patients was consistent with the overall study population.\n\nElevated haematocrit\n\nHaematocrit increase was observed with empagliflozin treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\n\nDue to its mechanism of action, patients taking Synjardy will test positive for glucose in their urine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCo-administration of multiple doses of empagliflozin and metformin does not meaningfully alter the\npharmacokinetics of either empagliflozin or metformin in healthy subjects.\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed for Synjardy. The following statements reflect the \ninformation available on the individual active substances.\n\n\n\n8\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\n\nDiuretics\nEmpagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of \ndehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. \nTherefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia when used in combination with empagliflozin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on empagliflozin\nIn vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is \nglucuronidation by uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and\nUGT2B7. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and \nOATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast \ncancer resistance protein (BCRP).\n\nCo-administration of empagliflozin with probenecid, an inhibitor of UGT enzymes and OAT3, \nresulted in a 26% increase in peak empagliflozin plasma concentrations (Cmax) and a 53% increase in \narea under the concentration-time curve (AUC). These changes were not considered to be clinically \nmeaningful. \n\nThe effect of UGT induction (e.g. induction by rifampicin or phenytoin) on empagliflozin has not been \nstudied. Co-treatment with known inducers of UGT enzymes is not recommended due to a potential \nrisk of decreased efficacy. If an inducer of these UGT enzymes must be co-administered, monitoring \nof glycaemic control to assess response to empagliflozin is appropriate.\n\nAn interaction study with gemfibrozil, an in vitro inhibitor of OAT3 and OATP1B1/1B3 transporters, \nshowed that empagliflozin Cmax increased by 15% and AUC increased by 59% following \nco-administration. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.\n\nInhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 transporters by co-administration with rifampicin resulted in a 75% \nincrease in Cmax and a 35% increase in AUC of empagliflozin. These changes were not considered to \nbe clinically meaningful.\n\nEmpagliflozin exposure was similar with and without co-administration with verapamil, a P-gp \ninhibitor, indicating that inhibition of P-gp does not have any clinically relevant effect on \nempagliflozin.\n\nInteraction studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin were not influenced by \nco-administration with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, \nverapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, torasemide and hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nEffects of empagliflozin on other medicinal products\nBased on in vitro studies, empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. \nEmpagliflozin does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. Drug-drug \ninteractions involving the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly \nadministered substrates of these enzymes are therefore considered unlikely. \n\nEmpagliflozin does not inhibit P-gp at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is \nconsidered unlikely to cause interactions with active substances that are P-gp substrates. \n\n\n\n9\n\nCo-administration of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, with empagliflozin resulted in a 6% increase in AUC \nand 14% increase in Cmax of digoxin. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.\n\nEmpagliflozin does not inhibit human uptake transporters such as OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 \nin vitro at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, as such, drug-drug interactions with \nsubstrates of these uptake transporters are considered unlikely.\n\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that empagliflozin had no clinically \nrelevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, \nlinagliptin, simvastatin, warfarin, ramipril, digoxin, diuretics and oral contraceptives.\n\nMetformin\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nAlcohol\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in cases of\nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment.\n\nOrganic cation transporters (OCT)\nMetformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2. Co-administration of metformin with \n• Inhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efficacy of metformin.\n• Inducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efficacy of \n\nmetformin.\n• Inhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprime, vandetanib, \n\nisavuconazole) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in \nmetformin plasma concentration.\n\n• Inhibitors of both OCT1 and OCT2 (such as crizotinib, olaparib) may alter efficacy and renal \nelimination of metformin.\n\nCaution is therefore advised, especially in patients with renal impairment, when these drugs are co-\nadministered with metformin, as metformin plasma concentration may increase. If needed, dose \nadjustment of metformin may be considered as OCT inhibitors/inducers may alter the efficacy of \nmetformin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nIodinated contrast agents\nMetformin must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until \nat least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nCombination requiring precautions for use\n\nSome medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such \nproducts in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.\n\nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta 2 agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If necessary, the \ndose of the anti hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other \nmedicinal product and on its discontinuation.\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. \nTherefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia when used in combination with metformin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\n\n\n10\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of this medicinal product or empagliflozin in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies show that empagliflozin crosses the placenta during late gestation to a very limited extent but \ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to early embryonic development. \nHowever, animal studies have shown adverse effects on postnatal development. A limited amount of \ndata suggests that the use of metformin in pregnant women is not associated with an increased risk of \ncongenital malformations. Animal studies with the combination of empagliflozin and metformin or \nwith metformin alone have shown reproductive toxicity at higher doses of metformin only (see section \n5.3). \n\nWhen the patient plans to become pregnant, and during pregnancy, it is recommended that diabetes is \nnot treated with this medicinal product, but insulin be used to maintain blood glucose levels as close to \nnormal as possible, to reduce the risk of malformations of the foetus associated with abnormal blood \nglucose levels.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nMetformin is excreted into human milk. No effects have been shown in breastfed newborns/infants of \ntreated women. No data in humans are available on excretion of empagliflozin into milk. Available \nanimal data have shown excretion of empagliflozin and metformin in milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n\nThis medicinal product should not be used during breast feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for this medicinal product or \nempagliflozin. Animal studies with empagliflozin and metformin do not indicate direct or indirect \nharmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSynjardy has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to \ntake precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines, in particular when \nSynjardy is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were hypoglycaemia in combination \nwith insulin and/or sulphonylurea and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nabdominal pain and loss of appetite). No additional adverse reactions were identified in clinical trials \nwith empagliflozin as add-on to metformin compared to the side effects of the single components.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe adverse reactions are listed by absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), or \nvery rare (<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\n\n\n11\n\nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions (MedDRA) from placebo-controlled studies and from \npost-marketing experience\n\nSystem organ \nclass\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare Not known\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nVaginal moniliasis, \nvulvovaginitis, \nbalanitis and other \ngenital infection1, 2\n\nUrinary tract \ninfection (including \npyelonephritis and \nurosepsis)1, 2\n\nNecrotising \nfasciitis of \nthe perineum \n(Fournier´s \ngangrene) a\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nHypoglycaemia \n(when used with \nsulphonylurea \nor insulin)1\n\nThirst2 Diabetic \nketoacidosisa\n\nLactic \nacidosis3\n\nVitamin B12 \ndeficiency3, 4\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nTaste disturbance3\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nVolume \ndepletion1, 2\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nGastrointestinal \nsymptoms3, 5\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nLiver function \ntests \nabnormalities3\n\nHepatitis3\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nPruritus \n(generalised)2, 3\n\nRash\n\nUrticaria Erythema3 Angioedema\n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders\n\nIncreased \nurination1, 2\n\nDysuria2\n\nInvestigations Serum lipids \nincreased2, b\n\nBlood \ncreatinine \nincreased/ \nGlomerular \nfiltration rate \ndecreased1\n\nHaematocrit \nincreased2, c\n\n1 See subsections below for additional information\n2 Identified adverse reactions of empagliflozin monotherapy\n3 Identified adverse reactions of metformin monotherapy\n4 Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption which may \n\nvery rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g. megaloblastic anaemia)\n5 Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite occur most \n\nfrequently during initiation of therapy and resolve spontaneously in most cases.\na See section 4.4\nb Mean percent increases from baseline for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg versus placebo, respectively, were \n\ntotal cholesterol 5.0% and 5.2% versus 3.7%; HDL-cholesterol 4.6% and 2.7% versus -0.5%; LDL-cholesterol \n9.1% and 8.7% versus 7.8%; triglycerides 5.4% and 10.8% versus 12.1%.\n\nc Mean changes from baseline in haematocrit were 3.6% and 4.0% for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg, \nrespectively, compared to 0% for placebo. In the EMPA-REG Outcome study, haematocrit values returned \ntowards baseline values after a follow-up period of 30 days after treatment stop.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nHypoglycaemia\n\nThe frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the background therapy in the respective studies and\nwas similar for empagliflozin and placebo as add-on to metformin, as add-on to linagliptin and \n\n\n\n12\n\nmetformin, for the combination of empagliflozin with metformin in drug-naïve patients compared to \nthose treated with empagliflozin and metformin as individual components, and as adjunct to standard \ncare therapy. An increased frequency was noted when empagliflozin given as add-on to metformin and\na sulfonylurea (empagliflozin 10 mg: 16.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 11.5% and placebo: 8.4%), or as \nadd-on to metformin and insulin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 31.3%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 36.2% and \nplacebo: 34.7%). \n\nMajor hypoglycaemia (events requiring assistance)\nThe overall frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was low (<1%) and similar for\nempagliflozin and placebo as add-on to metformin, and for the combination of empagliflozin with \nmetformin in drug-naïve patients compared to those treated with empagliflozin and metformin as \nindividual components, and as adjunct to standard care therapy. Major hypoglycaemic events occurred \nin 0.5%, 0% and 0.5% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg and placebo \nwhen added on to metformin and insulin, respectively. No patient had a major hypoglycaemic event in \nthe combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea and as add-on to linagliptin and metformin.\n\nUrinary tract infection\n\nThe overall frequency of urinary tract infection adverse events was higher in metformin-treated \npatients who received empagliflozin 10 mg (8.8%) compared to empagliflozin 25 mg (6.6%) or\nplacebo (7.8%). Similar to placebo, urinary tract infection was reported more frequently for \nempagliflozin in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. The intensity of \nurinary tract infections (i.e. mild/moderate/severe) was similar to placebo. Urinary tract infection \nevents were reported more frequently for empagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo in female \npatients, but not for empagliflozin 25 mg. The frequencies of urinary tract infections were low for \nmale patients and were balanced across treatment groups.\n\nVaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infection\n\nVaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infections were reported more \nfrequently in metformin-treated patients who received empagliflozin 10 mg (4.0%) and empagliflozin \n25 mg (3.9%) compared to placebo (1.3%), and were reported more frequently for empagliflozin \ncompared to placebo in female patients. The difference in frequency was less pronounced in male \npatients. Genital tract infections were mild and moderate in intensity, none was severe in intensity.\n\nIncreased urination\n\nAs expected from the mechanism of action, increased urination (as assessed by PT search including \npollakiuria, polyuria, nocturia) was observed at higher frequencies in metformin-treated patients who \nreceived empagliflozin 10 mg (3.0%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (2.9%) compared to placebo (1.4%) as \nadd-on to metformin therapy. Increased urination was mostly mild or moderate in intensity. The \nfrequency of reported nocturia was comparable between placebo and empagliflozin (<1%).\n\nVolume depletion\n\nThe overall frequency of volume depletion (including the predefined terms blood pressure \n(ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolaemia, \northostatic hypotension, and syncope) in metformin-treated patients who received empagliflozin was \nlow: 0.6% for empagliflozin 10 mg, 0.3% for empagliflozin 25 mg and 0.1% for placebo. The effect of \nempagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which could affect \nhydration status of patients age 75 years and older. In patients ≥75 years of age volume depletion \nevents have been reported in a single patient treated with empagliflozin 25 mg as add-on to metformin \ntherapy.\n\n\n\n13\n\nBlood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased\n\nThe overall frequency of patients with increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration \nrate were similar between empagliflozin and placebo as add-on to metformin (blood creatinine \nincreased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.5%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0.1%, placebo 0.4%; glomerular filtration \nrate decreased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0%, placebo 0.2%).\nInitial increases in creatinine and initial decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rates in patients \ntreated with empagliflozin as add-on to metformin therapy were generally transient during continuous \ntreatment or reversible after drug discontinuation of treatment.\nConsistently, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, patients treated with empagliflozin experienced \nan initial fall in eGFR (mean: 3 ml/min/1.73 m2). Thereafter, eGFR was maintained during continued \ntreatment. Mean eGFR returned to baseline after treatment discontinuation suggesting acute \nhaemodynamic changes may play a role in these renal function changes.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nIn controlled clinical studies single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin (equivalent to 32-times the \nhighest recommended daily dose) in healthy volunteers and multiple daily doses of up to 100 mg \nempagliflozin (equivalent to 4-times the highest recommended daily dose) in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes did not show any toxicity. Empagliflozin increased urine glucose excretion leading to an \nincrease in urine volume. The observed increase in urine volume was not dose-dependent and is not \nclinically meaningful. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in humans.\n\nMetformin\n\nHypoglycaemia has not been seen with metformin doses of up to 85 g, although lactic acidosis has \noccurred in such circumstances. High overdose of metformin or concomitant risks may lead to lactic \nacidosis. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital (see sections 4.4 and \n4.5). \n\nTherapy\n\nIn the event of an overdose, treatment should be initiated as appropriate to the patient‘s clinical status. \nThe most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is haemodialysis. The removal of \nempagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD20\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14\n\nMechanism of action\n\nSynjardy combines two antihyperglycaemic medicinal products with complementary mechanisms of\naction to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: empagliflozin, an inhibitor of \nsodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide \nclass.\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nEmpagliflozin is a reversible, highly potent (IC50 of 1.3 nmol) and selective competitive inhibitor of \nSGLT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into \nperipheral tissues and is 5000-times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter \nresponsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas \nexpression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible, as the predominant transporter, for \nthe reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with type \n2 diabetes and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed.\n\nEmpagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes by reducing renal glucose \nreabsorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is \ndependent on blood glucose concentration and GFR. Inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes and hyperglycaemia leads to excess glucose excretion in the urine. In addition, initiation of \nempagliflozin increases excretion of sodium resulting in osmotic diuresis and reduced intravascular \nvolume.\n\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first \ndose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose \nexcretion was maintained at the end of the 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 78 g/day\nwith empagliflozin 25 mg. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in \nplasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. \n\nEmpagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. The mechanism of \naction of empagliflozin is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway and this contributes to \na low risk of hypoglycaemia. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including \nHomeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) was noted. In addition, urinary glucose excretion \ntriggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed \nwith empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate \nreduction of blood pressure. The glucosuria, natriuresis and osmotic diuresis observed with \nempagliflozin may contribute to the improvement in cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nMetformin\n\nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia.\n\nMetformin may act via 3 mechanisms:\n reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis,\n in muscle, by increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and utilization,\n and delay of intestinal glucose absorption.\n\nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. Metformin \nincreases the transport capacity of all types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUTs) known to date.\n\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term\nclinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\n\n\n\n15\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nBoth improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are \nan integral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nGlycaemic efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes have been assessed in a total of 10,366 patients with \ntype 2 diabetes who were treated in 9 double-blind, placebo or active-controlled clinical studies of at \nleast 24 weeks duration, of which 2950 patients received empagliflozin 10 mg and 3701 received \nempagliflozin 25 mg as add-on to metformin therapy. Of these, 266 or 264 patients were treated with\nempagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg as add-on to metformin plus insulin, respectively.\n\nTreatment with empagliflozin in combination with metformin with or without other antidiabetic \nmedicinal products (pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitors, and insulin) led to clinically relevant \nimprovements in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, systolic and diastolic blood \npressure. Administration of empagliflozin 25 mg resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving \nHbA1c goal of less than 7% and fewer patients needing glycaemic rescue compared to empagliflozin \n10 mg and placebo. In patients age 75 years and older, numerically lower reductions in HbA1c were \nobserved with empagliflozin treatment. Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater \nreduction in HbA1c. In addition, empagliflozin as adjunct to standard care therapy reduced \ncardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.\n\nEmpagliflozin as add-on to metformin, sulphonylurea, pioglitazone\n\nEmpagliflozin as add-on to metformin, metformin and a sulphonylurea, or pioglitazone and metformin\nresulted in statistically significant (p<0.0001) reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared to \nplacebo (Table 3). In addition it resulted in a clinically meaningful reduction in FPG, systolic and \ndiastolic blood pressure compared to placebo.\nIn the double-blind placebo-controlled extension of these studies, reduction of HbA1c, body weight \nand blood pressure were sustained up to Week 76.\n\nTable 3: Efficacy results of 24 week placebo-controlled studies\nAdd-on to metformin therapya\n\nPlacebo\nEmpagliflozin\n\n10 mg 25 mg\nN 207 217 213\n\nHbA1c (%)\nBaseline (mean) 7.90 7.94 7.86\nChange from baseline1 -0.13 -0.70 -0.77\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(97.5% CI)\n-0.57* (-0.72, -0.42) -0.64* (-0.79, -0.48)\n\nN 184 199 191\nPatients (%) achieving \nHbA1c <7% with baseline \nHbA1c ≥7%2\n\n12.5 37.7 38.7\n\nN 207 217 213\nBody Weight (kg)\n\nBaseline (mean) 79.73 81.59 82.21\nChange from baseline1 -0.45 -2.08 -2.46\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(97.5% CI)\n-1.63* (-2.17, -1.08) -2.01* (-2.56, -1.46)\n\nN 207 217 213\nSBP (mmHg)2\n\nBaseline (mean) 128.6 129.6 130.0\nChange from baseline1 -0.4 -4.5 -5.2\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(95% CI)\n-4.1* (-6.2, -2.1) -4.8* (-6.9, -2.7)\n\n\n\n16\n\nAdd-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea therapya\n\nPlacebo\nEmpagliflozin\n\n10 mg 25 mg\nN 225 225 216\n\nHbA1c (%)\nBaseline (mean) 8.15 8.07 8.10\nChange from baseline1 -0.17 -0.82 -0.77\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(97.5% CI)\n-0.64* (-0.79, -0.49) -0.59* (-0.74, -0.44)\n\nN 216 209 202\nPatients (%) achieving \nHbA1c <7% with baseline \nHbA1c ≥7%2\n\n9.3 26.3 32.2\n\nN 225 225 216\nBody Weight (kg)\n\nBaseline (mean) 76.23 77.08 77.50\nChange from baseline1 -0.39 -2.16 -2.39\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(97.5% CI)\n-1.76* (-2.25, -1.28) -1.99* (-2.48, -1.50)\n\nN 225 225 216\nSBP (mmHg)2\n\nBaseline (mean) 128.8 128.7 129.3\nChange from baseline1 -1.4 -4.1 -3.5\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(95% CI)\n-2.7 (-4.6, -0.8) -2.1 (-4.0, -0.2)\n\nAdd-on to pioglitazone + metformin therapyb\n\nPlacebo\nEmpagliflozin\n\n10 mg 25 mg\nN 124 125 127\nHbA1c (%)\n\nBaseline (mean) 8.15 8.07 8.10\nChange from baseline1 -0.11 -0.55 -0.70\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(97.5% CI)\n-0.45* (-0.69, -0.21) -0.60* (-0.83, -0.36)\n\nN 118 116 123\nPatients (%) achieving \nHbA1c <7% with baseline \nHbA1c ≥7%2\n\n8.5 22.4 28.5\n\nN 124 125 127\nBody Weight (kg)\n\nBaseline (mean) 79.45 79.44 80.98\nChange from baseline1 0.40 -1.74 -1.59\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(97.5% CI)\n-2.14* (-2.93, -1.35) -2.00* (-2.78, -1.21)\n\nN 124 125 127\nSBP (mmHg)2, 3\n\nBaseline (mean) 125.5 126.3 126.3\nChange from baseline1 0.8 -3.5 -3.3\nDifference from placebo1\n\n(95% CI)\n-4.2** (-6.94, -1.53) -4.1** (-6.76, -1.37)\n\na Full analysis set (FAS) using last observation carried forward (LOCF) prior to glycaemic rescue \ntherapy\nbSubgroup analysis for patients on additional background of metformin (FAS, LOCF)\n1 Mean adjusted for baseline value\n2 Not evaluated for statistical significance as a part of the sequential confirmatory testing procedure\n\n\n\n17\n\n3 LOCF, values after antihypertensive rescue censored\n* p-value <0.0001\n** p-value <0.01\n\nEmpagliflozin in combination with metformin in drug-naïve patients\n\nA factorial design study of 24 weeks duration was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \nempagliflozin in drug-naïve patients.

The mean age was 63 years, the mean HbA1c was 8.1%, and 71.5% were male. At baseline,\n74% of patients were being treated with metformin, 48% with insulin, and 43% with a sulfonylurea. \nAbout half of the patients (52.2%) had an eGFR of 60-90 ml/min/1.73 m2, 17.8% of \n45-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 7.7% of 30-45 ml/min/1.73 m2.\n\nAt week 12, an adjusted mean (SE) improvement in HbA1c when compared to baseline of 0.11% \n(0.02) in the placebo group, 0.65% (0.02) and 0.71% (0.02) in the empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg groups \nwas observed. After the first 12 weeks glycaemic control was optimized independent of investigative \ntreatment. Therefore the effect was attenuated at week 94, with an adjusted mean (SE) improvement in \nHbA1c of 0.08% (0.02) in the placebo group, 0.50% (0.02) and 0.55% (0.02) in the empagliflozin \n10 and 25 mg groups.\n\nEmpagliflozin was superior in preventing the primary combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, \nnon-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke, as compared with placebo. The treatment effect \nwas driven by a significant reduction in cardiovascular death with no significant change in non-fatal \nmyocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. The reduction of cardiovascular death was comparable for \nempagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg (see Figure 1) and confirmed by an improved overall survival (Table \n9).\n\nThe efficacy for preventing cardiovascular mortality has not been conclusively established in patients \nusing empagliflozin concomitantly with DPP-4 inhibitors or in Black patients because the \nrepresentation of these groups in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study was limited.\n\nTable 9: Treatment effect for the primary composite endpoint, its components and mortalitya\n\nPlacebo Empagliflozinb\n\nN 2333 4687\nTime to first event of CV death, non-fatal \nMI, or non-fatal stroke N (%)\n\n282 (12.1) 490 (10.5)\n\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95.02% CI)* 0.86 (0.74, 0.99)\np−value for superiority 0.0382\n\nCV Death N (%) 137 (5.9) 172 (3.7)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 0.62 (0.49, 0.77)\np-value <0.0001\n\nNon-fatal MI N (%) 121 (5.2) 213 (4.5)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 0.87 (0.70, 1.09)\np−value 0.2189\n\nNon-fatal stroke N (%) 60 (2.6) 150 (3.2)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 1.24 (0.92, 1.67)\np−value 0.1638\n\nAll-cause mortality N (%) 194 (8.3) 269 (5.7)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 0.68 (0.57, 0.82)\np-value <0.0001\n\nNon-CV mortality N (%) 57 (2.4) 97 (2.1)\nHazard ratio vs. placebo (95% CI) 0.84 (0.60, 1.16)\n\nCV = cardiovascular, MI = myocardial infarction\na Treated set (TS), i.e. patients who had received at least one dose of study drug\nb Pooled doses of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg\n* Since data from the trial were included in an interim analysis, a two-sided 95.02% confidence \ninterval applied which corresponds to a p-value of less than 0.0498 for significance.\n\n\n\n23\n\nFigure 1 Time to occurrence of cardiovascular death in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study\n\nHeart failure requiring hospitalization \nIn the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, empagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure requiring \nhospitalization compared with placebo (empagliflozin 2.7 %; placebo 4.1 %; HR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.50, \n0.85).\n\nNephropathy\nIn the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, for time to first nephropathy event, the HR was 0.61 (95 % CI \n0.53, 0.70) for empagliflozin (12.7 %) vs placebo (18.8 %).\n\nIn addition, empagliflozin showed a higher (HR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.40, 2.37) occurrence of sustained \nnormo- or micro-albuminuria (49.7 %) in patients with baseline macro-albuminuria compared with \nplacebo (28.8 %).\n\n2 hour post-prandial glucose\n\nTreatment with empagliflozin as add-on to metformin or metformin plus sulfonylurea resulted in \nclinically meaningful improvement of 2-hour post-prandial glucose (meal tolerance test) at 24 weeks \n(add-on to metformin, placebo: +5.9 mg/dl, empagliflozin 10 mg: -46.0 mg/dl, empagliflozin \n25 mg: -44.6 mg/dl; add-on to metformin plus sulphonylurea, placebo: -2.3 mg/dl, empagliflozin \n10 mg: -35.7 mg/dl, empagliflozin 25 mg: -36.6 mg/dl).\n\nPatients with baseline HbA1c ≥9%\n\nIn a pre-specified analysis of subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥9.0%, treatment with empagliflozin \n10 mg or 25 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c at \nWeek 24 (adjusted mean change from baseline of -1.49% for empagliflozin 25 mg, -1.40% for \nempagliflozin 10 mg, and -0.44% for placebo).\n\nBody weight\n\nIn a pre-specified pooled analysis of 4 placebo controlled studies, treatment with empagliflozin (68% \nof all patients were on metformin background) resulted in body weight reduction compared to placebo \nat week 24 (-2.04 kg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -2.26 kg for empagliflozin 25 mg and -0.24 kg for \n\n\n\n24\n\nplacebo) that was maintained up to week 52 (-1.96 kg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -2.25 kg for \nempagliflozin 25 mg and -0.16 kg for placebo).\n\nBlood pressure\n\nThe efficacy and safety of empagliflozin was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo controlled study of \n12 weeks duration in patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure on different antidiabetic \nand up to 2 antihypertensive therapies. Treatment with empagliflozin once daily resulted in \nstatistically significant improvement in HbA1c, and 24 hour mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure \nas determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Table 10).

Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed:\n a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \n\ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034,\n\n a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017,\n\n a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin \n13.5 events/1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.011), and \nversus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n18.9 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.021),\n\n a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin \n11 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.01).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSynjardy in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nSynjardy\n\nThe results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that Synjardy\n(empagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride) 5 mg/850 mg, 5 mg/1,000 mg, 12.5 mg/850 mg, and \n12.5 mg/1,000 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of corresponding doses \nof empagliflozin and metformin as individual tablets.\n\nAdministration of empagliflozin/metformin 12.5 mg/1,000 mg under fed conditions resulted in 9% \ndecrease in AUC and a 28% decrease in Cmax for empagliflozin, when compared to fasted conditions. \nFor metformin, AUC decreased by 12% and Cmax decreased by 26% compared to fasting conditions. \nThe observed effect of food on empagliflozin and metformin is not considered to be clinically \nrelevant. However, as metformin is recommended to be given with meals, Synjardy is also proposed to \nbe given with food.\n\nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nSynjardy.\n\n\n\n26\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin have been extensively characterised in healthy volunteers and \npatients with type 2 diabetes. After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with peak \nplasma concentrations occurring at a median tmax of 1.5 hours post-dose. Thereafter, plasma \nconcentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow \nterminal phase. The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol.h/l and 259 nmol/l with \nempagliflozin 10 mg and 4740 nmol.h/l and 687 nmol/l with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily. \nSystemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner. The single-dose and \nsteady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin were similar suggesting linear \npharmacokinetics with respect to time. There were no clinically relevant differences in empagliflozin \npharmacokinetics between healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of 5 mg empagliflozin twice daily and 10 mg empagliflozin once daily were \ncompared in healthy subjects. Overall exposure (AUCss) of empagliflozin over a 24-hour period with \nempagliflozin 5 mg administered twice daily was similar to empagliflozin 10 mg administered once \ndaily. As expected, empagliflozin 5 mg administered twice daily compared with 10 mg empagliflozin \nonce daily resulted in lower Cmax and higher trough plasma empagliflozin concentrations (Cmin).\n\nAdministration of empagliflozin 25 mg after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in \nslightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax by approximately 37% \ncompared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not \nconsidered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food. Similar \nresults were obtained when Synjardy (empagliflozin/metformin) combination tablets were \nadministered with high-fat and high calorie meal.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 l based on the population \npharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy \nvolunteers, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 37% and plasma protein binding was \n86%.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nNo major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma, as defined by at least 10% of \ntotal drug-related material, and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-, \n3-, and 6-O-glucuronide). In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of \nempagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases \nUGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9.\n\nElimination\n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of \nempagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 hours and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 l/hour. The \ninter-subject and residual variabilities for empagliflozin oral clearance were 39.1% and 35.8%, \nrespectively. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were \nreached by the fifth dose. Consistent with the half-life, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to \nplasma AUC, was observed at steady-state. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin \nsolution to healthy volunteers, approximately 96% of the drug-related radioactivity was eliminated in \nfaeces (41%) or urine (54%). The majority of drug-related radioactivity recovered in faeces was \nunchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug-related radioactivity excreted in urine was \nunchanged parent drug.\n\n\n\n27\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 - <90 ml/min) \nand patients with kidney failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), AUC of empagliflozin increased by \napproximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively compared to subjects with normal renal \nfunction. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment \nand kidney failure/ESRD compared to patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of \nempagliflozin were roughly 20% higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as \ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed \nthat the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in creatinine clearance\nleading to an increase in drug exposure.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh \nclassification, AUC of empagliflozin increased approximately by 23%, 47%, and 75% and Cmax by \napproximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.\n\nBody Mass Index\nBody mass index had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on \nthe population pharmacokinetic analysis. In this analysis, AUC was estimated to be 5.82%, 10.4%, and \n17.3% lower in subjects with BMI of 30, 35, and 45 kg/m2, respectively, compared to subjects with a \nbody mass index of 25 kg/m2.\n\nGender\nGender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\nRace\nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis, AUC was estimated to be 13.5% higher in Asians with a \nbody mass index of 25 kg/m2 compared to non-Asians with a body mass index of 25 kg/m2.\n\nElderly \nAge did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on \nthe population pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\nPaediatric population\nA paediatric Phase 1 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin \n(5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg) in children and adolescents ≥10 to <18 years of age with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. The observed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those \nfound in adult subjects.\n\nMetformin\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 hours. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg or\n850 mg metformin hydrochloride tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects. After an oral\ndose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. After oral administration, metformin \nabsorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin \nabsorption are non-linear. At the recommended metformin doses and dosing schedules, steady-state \nplasma concentrations are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally less than 1 microgram/ml. \nIn controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 5 microgram/ml, \neven at maximum doses.\n\nFood decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin. Following administration \nof a dose of 850 mg metformin hydrochloride, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% \n\n\n\n28\n\ndecrease in AUC and a 35 minute prolongation of the time to peak plasma concentration were\nobserved. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.\n\nDistribution\n\nPlasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) ranged \nbetween 63 - 276 l.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans.\n\nElimination\n\nRenal clearance of metformin is >400 ml/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 hours.\n\nWhen renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and\nthus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nSingle dose study: after single doses of metformin hydrochloride 500 mg, paediatric patients have\nshown a similar pharmacokinetic profile to that observed in healthy adults.\n\nMultiple-dose study: After repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 7 days in paediatric patients the \npeak plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC0-t) were approximately 33% and 40%\nlower, respectively, compared to diabetic adults who received repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily \nfor 14 days. As the dose is individually titrated based on glycaemic control, this is of limited clinical \nrelevance.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nEmpagliflozin and metformin\n\nGeneral toxicity studies in rats of up to 13 weeks were performed with the combination of\nempagliflozin and metformin and did not reveal any additional target organs when compared to \nempagliflozin or metformin alone. Some responses were increased by the combination treatment, such \nas effects on renal physiology, electrolyte balance and acid/base state. However, only hypochloremia \nwas considered adverse at exposures of approximately 9- and 3-times the clinical AUC exposure of \nthe maximum recommended dose of empagliflozin and metformin, respectively.\n\nAn embryofetal development study in pregnant rats did not indicate a teratogenic effect attributed to \nthe co-administration of empagliflozin and metformin at exposures of approximately 14-times the \nclinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin associated with the highest dose, and 4-times the clinical \nAUC exposure of metformin associated with the 2000 mg dose.\n\nEmpagliflozin\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity, fertility and early embryonic development. \n\n\n\n29\n\nIn long term toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, signs of toxicity were observed at exposures greater \nthan or equal to 10-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin. Most toxicity was consistent with \nsecondary pharmacology related to urinary glucose loss and electrolyte imbalances including\ndecreased body weight and body fat, increased food consumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased \nserum glucose and increases in other serum parameters reflective of increased protein metabolism and\ngluconeogenesis, urinary changes such as polyuria and glucosuria, and microscopic changes including \nmineralisation in kidney and some soft and vascular tissues. Microscopic evidence of the effects of \nexaggerated pharmacology on the kidney observed in some species included tubular dilatation, and \ntubular and pelvic mineralisation at approximately 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin \nassociated with the 25 mg dose.\n\nEmpagliflozin is not genotoxic.\n\nIn a 2-year carcinogenicity study, empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female \nrats up to the highest dose of 700 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 72-times the \nmaximal clinical AUC exposure to empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment-related benign vascular \nproliferative lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node were observed at the highest dose, \nbut not at 300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 26-times the maximal clinical exposure \nto empagliflozin. Interstitial cell tumours in the testes were observed with a higher incidence in rats at \n300 mg/kg/day and above, but not at 100 mg/kg/day which corresponds to approximately 18-times the \nmaximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. Both tumours are common in rats and are unlikely to be \nrelevant to humans.\n\nEmpagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female mice at doses up to \n1,000 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 62-times the maximal clinical exposure to\nempagliflozin. Empagliflozin induced renal tumours in male mice at 1,000 mg/kg/day, but not at \n300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 11-times the maximal clinical exposure to\nempagliflozin. The mode of action for these tumours is dependent on the natural predisposition of the \nmale mouse to renal pathology and a metabolic pathway not reflective of humans. The male mouse \nrenal tumours are considered not relevant to humans.\n\nAt exposures sufficiently in excess of exposure in humans after therapeutic doses, empagliflozin had \nno adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development. Empagliflozin administered during the \nperiod of organogenesis was not teratogenic. Only at maternally toxic doses, empagliflozin also \ncaused bent limb bones in the rat and increased embryofetal loss in the rabbit.\n\nIn pre- and postnatal toxicity studies in rats, reduced weight gain of offspring was observed at \nmaternal exposures approximately 4-times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. No such \neffect was seen at systemic exposure equal to the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. The \nrelevance of this finding to humans is unclear.\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study in the rat, when empagliflozin was administered from postnatal day 21 \nuntil postnatal day 90, non-adverse, minimal to mild renal tubular and pelvic dilation in juvenile rats \nwas seen only at 100 mg/kg/day, which approximates 11-times the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg. \nThese findings were absent after a 13 weeks drug-free recovery period.\n\nMetformin\n\nPreclinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of\nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, or carcinogenic potential or reproductive\ntoxicity. At dose levels of 500 mg/kg/day administered to Wistar Hannover rats, associated with \n7-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of metformin, teratogenicity of metformin \nwas observed, mostly evident as an increase in the number of skeletal malformations.\n\n\n\n30\n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Synjardy is and what it is used for\n2.

What Synjardy is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Synjardy is\nSynjardy contains two active substances empagliflozin and metformin. Each belongs to a group of \nmedicines called “oral anti-diabetics”. These are medicines taken by mouth to treat type 2 diabetes. \n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a disease that comes from both your genes and your lifestyle. If you have type 2 \ndiabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood, \nand your body is unable to use its own insulin effectively. This results in high levels of glucose in your \nblood which can lead to medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and poor \ncirculation in your limbs.\n\nHow Synjardy works\nEmpagliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) \ninhibitors. It works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar (glucose) \nto be removed in your urine. Metformin works in a different way to lower blood sugar levels, mainly \nby blocking glucose production in the liver. \n\nThereby Synjardy lowers the amount of sugar in your blood. This medicine can also help prevent heart \ndisease. \n\nWhat Synjardy is used for\n Synjardy is added to diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes in adult patients (aged 18 years \n\nand older) whose diabetes cannot be controlled by adding metformin alone or metformin with \nother medicines for diabetes.\n\n Synjardy can also be combined with other medicines for the treatment of diabetes. These may \nbe medicines taken by mouth or given by injection such as insulin.\n\n\n\n67\n\n In addition, Synjardy can be used as an alternative to taking both empagliflozin and metformin \nas single tablets. To avoid overdose, do not continue taking empagliflozin and metformin tablets\nseparately, if you are taking this medicine.\n\nIt is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as told by your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Synjardy\n\nDo not take Synjardy\n if you are allergic to empagliflozin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6);\n if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood \n\nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see ‘Risk of lactic \nacidosis’ below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ‘ketone \nbodies’ accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity \nsmell;\n\n if you have had a diabetic pre-coma;\n if you have severely reduced kidney function;\n if you have a severe infection such as an infection affecting your lung or bronchial system or \n\nyour kidney. Severe infections may lead to kidney problems, which can put you at risk for lactic \nacidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions');\n\n if you have lost a lot of water from your body (dehydration), e.g. due to long-lasting or severe \ndiarrhoea, or if you have vomited several times in a row. Dehydration may lead to kidney \nproblems, which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions');\n\n if you are treated for acute heart failure or have recently had a heart attack, have severe \nproblems with your circulation (such as shock) or have breathing difficulties. This may lead to a \nlack in oxygen supply to tissue which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see section \n‘Warnings and precautions');\n\n if you have problems with your liver;\n if you drink large amounts of alcohol, either every day or only from time to time (see section \n\n“Synjardy with alcohol”).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nRisk of lactic acidosis\nSynjardy may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your \nkidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with\nuncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further \ninformation below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a \nreduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart diseases).\n\nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Synjardy for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Synjardy and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience \nsome of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. \nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include:\n vomiting\n stomach ache (abdominal pain)\n muscle cramps\n a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness\n\n\n\n68\n\n difficulty in breathing\n reduced body temperature and heartbeat\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine, and during treatment:\n if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, \n\nfast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, \na sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a \ndoctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of “diabetic \nketoacidosis” – a rare, but serious, sometines life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes \nbecause of increased levels of “ketone bodies” in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of \ndeveloping diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol \nconsumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to \nmajor surgery or serious illness;\n\n if you have “type 1 diabetes” – this type usually starts when you are young and your body does \nnot produce any insulin. Synjardy should not be used to treat patients with type 1 diabetes;\n\n might be at risk of dehydration, for example:\no if you are being sick, have diarrhoea or fever, or if you are not able to eat or drink\no if you are taking medicines that increase urine production [diuretics] or lower blood \n\npressure\no if you are over 75 years old\n\nPossible signs are listed in section 4 under ‘dehydration’. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking \nSynjardy until you recover to prevent loss of too much body fluid. Ask about ways to prevent \ndehydration. \n\n if you are 85 years old or older as you should not start taking Synjardy due to limited \ntherapeutic experience;\n\n if you have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask \nyou to stop taking Synjardy until you have recovered;\n\n if you need to undergo an examination with iodination contrast agents (such as X-ray or scan). \nMore information is given below in “Other medicines and Synjardy”.\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling \ngenerally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening \ninfection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier´s gangrene which destroys the tissue \nunder the skin. Fournier’s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\nSurgery\nIf you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Synjardy during and for some time after the \nprocedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nSynjardy.\n\nKidney function\nDuring treatment with Synjardy, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or \nmore frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.\n\nFoot care\nLike for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice \nregarding foot care given by your health care professional.\n\nUrine glucose\nBecause of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are taking this \nmedicine.\n\n\n\n69\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years, because it has \nnot been studied in these patients.\n\nOther medicines and Synjardy\nIf you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Synjardy before or at the time of the \ninjection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nSynjardy.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may \nneed more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the \ndosage of Synjardy. It is especially important to mention the following:\n medicines which increase urine production (diuretics), as Synjardy may increase the risk of \n\nlosing too much fluid. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Synjardy. Possible signs of \nlosing too much fluid from your body are listed in section 4.\n\n other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or a \n“sulphonylurea” medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, to \nprevent your blood sugar levels from getting too low (hypoglycaemia).\n\n medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially if you have \nreduced kidney function (such as verapamil, rifampicin, cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, \ntrimethoprime, vandetanib, isavuconazole, crizotinib, olaparib).\n\n bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) which are used to treat asthma.\n corticosteroids (given by mouth, as an injection, or inhaled), which are used to treat \n\ninflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis.\n medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as \n\nibuprofen and celecoxib).\n certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists).\n medicines that contain alcohol (see section ‘Synjardy with alcohol’).\n iodinated contrast agents (medicines used during an X-ray, see section ‘Warnings and \n\nprecautions’.\n\nSynjardy with alcohol\nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Synjardy since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis\n(see section ‘Warnings and precautions’).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDo not take Synjardy if you are pregnant. It is unknown if this medicine is harmful to the unborn \nchild.\n\nMetformin passes into human milk in small amounts. It is not known whether empagliflozin passes \ninto human breast milk. Do not take Synjardy if you are breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSynjardy has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nTaking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause \nblood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, \nsweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or \nuse any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Synjardy.\n\n\n\n70\n\n3. How to take Synjardy\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist\nif you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\nThe dose of Synjardy varies depending on your condition and the doses of diabetes medicines you \ncurrently take. Your doctor will adjust your dose as necessary and tell you exactly which strength of \nthe medicine to take.\n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet twice a day. Your doctor will normally start Synjardy treatment \nby prescribing the strength of tablet that supplies the same dose of metformin you are already taking \n(850 mg or 1,000 mg twice a day), and the lowest dose of empagliflozin (5 mg twice a day). If you are \nalready taking both medicines separately, your doctor will start treatment with tablets of Synjardy that \nwill supply the same amount of both. If you have reduced kidney function, your doctor may prescribe \na lower dose.\n\nTaking this medicine\n Swallow the tablet whole with water.\n Take the tablets with meals to lower your chance of an upset stomach.\n Take the tablet twice daily by mouth.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe Synjardy together with another diabetes medicine. Remember to take all \nmedicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best results for your health. Your doctor may need \nto adjust your doses to control your blood sugar.\n\nAppropriate diet and exercise help your body use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the \ndiet and exercise program recommended by your doctor while taking Synjardy.\n\nIf you take more Synjardy than you should\nIf you take more Synjardy tablets than you should have, you may experience lactic acidosis. \nSymptoms of lactic acidosis are non-specific such as feeling or being very sick, vomiting, stomach \nache with muscle cramps, a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness, and difficulty in \nbreathing. Further symptoms are reduced body temperature and heartbeat. If this happens to you, you \nmay need immediate hospital treatment, as lactic acidosis can lead to coma. Stop taking this \nmedicine immediately and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away (see section 2). \nTake the medicine pack with you.\n\nIf you forget to take Synjardy\nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is time for your \nnext dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose of this \nmedicine.\n\nIf you stop taking Synjardy\nDo not stop taking Synjardy without first consulting your doctor. Your blood sugar levels may increase \nwhen you stop taking Synjardy.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\n\n\n71\n\nContact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away if you have any of the following side \neffects:\n\nSevere allergic reaction, seen with unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the\navailable data )\nPossible signs of severe allergic reaction may include:\n swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue, or throat that may lead to difficulty breathing or\n\nswallowing)\n\nLactic acidosis, seen very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people)\nSynjardy may cause a very rare but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis (see section 2). If this \nhappens you must stop taking Synjardy and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately, \nas lactic acidosis may lead to coma.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis, seen rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\nThese are the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (see section 2):\n increased levels of “ketone bodies” in your urine or blood\n rapid weight loss\n feeling sick or being sick\n stomach pain\n excessive thirst\n fast and deep breathing\n confusion\n unusual sleepiness or tiredness\n a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your \n\nurine or sweat.\n\nThis may occur regardless of blood glucose level. Your doctor may decide to temporarily or \npermanently stop your treatment with Synjardy.\n\nContact your doctor as soon as possible if you notice the following side effects:\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), seen very commonly (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\nIf you take Synjardy with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea or \ninsulin, your risk of getting low blood sugar is increased. The signs of low blood sugar may include:\n shaking, sweating, feeling very anxious or confused, fast heart beat\n excessive hunger, headache\n\nYour doctor will tell you how to treat low blood sugar levels and what to do if you get any of the signs \nabove.
