NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nIMBRUVICA 140 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach hard capsule contains 140 mg of ibrutinib.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule (capsule).\n\nWhite opaque, hard capsule of 22 mm in length, marked with “ibr 140 mg” in black ink.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nIMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or \nrefractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).\n\nIMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (see section 5.1).\n\nIMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is indicated \nfor the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.\n\nIMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s \nmacroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for \npatients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab is \nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with WM.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with this medicinal product should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced \nin the use of anticancer medicinal products.\n\nPosology\nMCL\nThe recommended dose for the treatment of MCL is 560 mg (four capsules) once daily.\n\nCLL and WM\nThe recommended dose for the treatment of CLL, either as a single agent or in combination, is 420 mg \n(three capsules) once daily (for details of the combination regimen, see section 5.1).\nThe recommended dose for the treatment of WM is 420 mg (three capsules) once daily.\n\nTreatment should continue until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the patient.\n\nWhen administering IMBRUVICA in combination with anti-CD20 therapies, it is recommended to \nadminister IMBRUVICA prior to rituximab or obinutuzumab when given on the same day.\n\n\n\n3\n\nDose adjustments\nModerate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of ibrutinib (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nThe dose of ibrutinib should be reduced to 280 mg once daily (two capsules) when used concomitantly\nwith moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n\nThe dose of ibrutinib should be reduced to 140 mg once daily (one capsule) or withheld for up to \n7 days when it is used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n\nIMBRUVICA therapy should be withheld for any new onset or worsening \ngrade ≥3 non-haematological toxicity, grade 3 or greater neutropenia with infection or fever, or\ngrade 4 haematological toxicities. Once the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to grade 1 or \nbaseline (recovery), IMBRUVICA therapy may be reinitiated at the starting dose. If the toxicity \nreoccurs, the once daily dose should be reduced by one capsule (140 mg). A second reduction of dose \nby 140 mg may be considered as needed. If these toxicities persist or recur following two dose \nreductions, discontinue the medicinal product.\n\nRecommended dose modifications are described below:\n\nToxicity \noccurrence\n\nMCL dose modification after \nrecovery\n\nCLL/WM dose modification after \nrecovery\n\nFirst restart at 560 mg daily restart at 420 mg daily\nSecond restart at 420 mg daily restart at 280 mg daily\nThird restart at 280 mg daily restart at 140 mg daily\nFourth discontinue IMBRUVICA discontinue IMBRUVICA\n\nMissed dose\nIf a dose is not taken at the scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a \nreturn to the normal schedule the following day. The patient should not take extra capsules to make up \nthe missed dose.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo specific dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥65 years).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild \nor moderate renal impairment were treated in IMBRUVICA clinical studies. No dose adjustment is \nneeded for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine \nclearance). Hydration should be maintained and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically.\nAdminister IMBRUVICA to patients with severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min creatinine clearance) \nonly if the benefit outweighs the risk and monitor patients closely for signs of toxicity. There are no \ndata in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nIbrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In a hepatic impairment study, data showed an increase in \nibrutinib exposure (see section 5.2). For patients with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh class A), the \nrecommended dose is 280 mg daily (two capsules). For patients with moderate liver impairment \n(Child-Pugh class B), the recommended dose is 140 mg daily (one capsule). Monitor patients for signs \nof IMBRUVICA toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed. It is not recommended to \nadminister IMBRUVICA to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).\n\nSevere cardiac disease\nPatients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from IMBRUVICA clinical studies.\n\n\n\n4\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been\nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nIMBRUVICA should be administered orally once daily with a glass of water approximately at the \nsame time each day. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water and should not be opened, \nbroken, or chewed. IMBRUVICA must not be taken with grapefruit juice or Seville oranges (see \nsection 4.5).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nUse of preparations containing St. John’s Wort is contraindicated in patients treated with \nIMBRUVICA.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBleeding-related events\nThere have been reports of bleeding events in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, both with and \nwithout thrombocytopenia. These include minor bleeding events such as contusion, epistaxis, and \npetechiae; and major bleeding events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial \nhaemorrhage, and haematuria.\n\nWarfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with \nIMBRUVICA.\n\nUse of either anticoagulants or medicinal products that inhibit platelet function (antiplatelet agents) \nconcomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major bleeding. A higher risk for major \nbleeding was observed with anticoagulant than with antiplatelet agents. Consider the risks and benefits \nof anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs \nand symptoms of bleeding.\n\nSupplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided.\n\nIMBRUVICA should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of \nsurgery and the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe mechanism for the bleeding-related events is not fully understood. Patients with congenital \nbleeding diathesis have not been studied.\n\nLeukostasis\nCases of leukostasis have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. A high number of \ncirculating lymphocytes (>400,000/mcL) may confer increased risk. Consider temporarily withholding \nIMBRUVICA. Patients should be closely monitored. Administer supportive care including hydration \nand/or cytoreduction as indicated.\n\nSplenic rupture\nCases of splenic rupture have been reported following discontinuation of IMBRUVICA treatment. \nDisease status and spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound) \nwhen IMBRUVICA treatment is interrupted or ceased. Patients who develop left upper abdominal or \nshoulder tip pain should be evaluated and a diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered. \n\nInfections\nInfections (including sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in \npatients treated with IMBRUVICA. Some of these infections have been associated with hospitalisation \n\n\n\n5\n\nand death. Most patients with fatal infections also had neutropenia. Patients should be monitored for \nfever, neutropenia and infections and appropriate anti-infective therapy should be instituted as \nindicated. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for \nopportunistic infections.\n\nCases of invasive fungal infections, including cases of Aspergillosis, Cryptococcosis and \nPneumocystis jiroveci infections have been reported following the use of ibrutinib. Reported cases of \ninvasive fungal infections have been associated with fatal outcomes.\n\nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) including fatal ones have been reported \nfollowing the use of ibrutinib within the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. \nPhysicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening \nneurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected then appropriate \ndiagnostic evaluations should be undertaken and treatment suspended until PML is excluded. If any \ndoubt exists, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML including MRI \nscan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat \nneurological assessments should be considered.\n\nCytopenias\nTreatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) were \nreported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor complete blood counts monthly.\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)\nCases of ILD have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor patients for \npulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. If symptoms develop, interrupt IMBRUVICA and manage \nILD appropriately. If symptoms persist, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and \nfollow the dose modification guidelines.\n\n\n\n6\n\nCardiac arrhythmia and cardiac failure\nAtrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and cardiac failure have been \nreported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Cases of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been \nreported particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a \nprevious history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor all patients clinically for cardiac\nmanifestations, including cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac failure. Patients who develop arrhythmic \nsymptoms or new onset of dyspnoea, dizziness or fainting should be evaluated clinically and if \nindicated have an electrocardiogram (ECG) performed.\n\nIn patients who develop signs and/or symptoms of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, IMBRUVICA should \nbe temporarily discontinued and a thorough clinical benefit/risk assessment should be performed \nbefore possibly restarting therapy.\n\nIn patients with preexisting atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy, alternative treatment \noptions to IMBRUVICA should be considered. In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy \nwith IMBRUVICA a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be\nundertaken. In patients at high risk and where alternatives to IMBRUVICA are non-suitable, tightly \ncontrolled treatment with anticoagulants should be considered.\n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of cardiac failure during IMBRUVICA\ntreatment. In some of these cases cardiac failure resolved or improved after IMBRUVICA withdrawal \nor dose reduction. \n\nCerebrovascular accidents\nCases of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke including fatalities \nhave been reported with the use of ibrutinib, with and without concomitant atrial fibrillation and/or \nhypertension. Latency from the initiation of treatment with ibrutinib to the onset of ischaemic central \nnervous vascular conditions was in the most cases after several months (more than 1 month in 78% \nand more than 6 months in 44% of cases) emphasising the need for regular monitoring of patients \n(please see section 4.4 Cardiac arrhythmia and Hypertension and section 4.8).\n\nTumour lysis syndrome\nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Patients at risk of tumour lysis \nsyndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. Monitor patients closely and take \nappropriate precautions.\n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer\nNon-melanoma skin cancers were reported more frequently in patients treated with IMBRUVICA than \nin patients treated with comparators in pooled comparative randomised phase 3 studies. Monitor \npatients for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer.\n\nViral reactivation\nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including fatal events, have been reported in patients receiving \nIMBRUVICA. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) status should be established before initiating treatment with \nIMBRUVICA. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with \nexpertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. If patients have positive hepatitis B serology, \na liver disease expert should be consulted before the start of treatment and the patient should be \nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.\n\nHypertension\nHypertension has occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA (see section 4.8). Regularly monitor \nblood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA and initiate or adjust antihypertensive medication \nthroughout treatment with IMBRUVICA as appropriate.\n\nHaemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\nCases of HLH (including fatal cases) have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. HLH \nis a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterised by clinical signs and \n\n\n\n7\n\nsymptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. HLH is characterised by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, \nhypertriglyceridaemia, high serum ferritin and cytopenias. Patients should be informed about \nsymptoms of HLH. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should \nbe evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered.\n\nDrug-drug interactions\nCo-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with IMBRUVICA may lead to increased \nibrutinib exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity. On the contrary, co-administration of \nCYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased IMBRUVICA exposure and consequently a risk for lack of \nefficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of IMBRUVICA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and strong or \nmoderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided whenever possible and co-administration should only \nbe considered when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. Patients should be \nclosely monitored for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity if a CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5). If a CYP3A4 inducer must be used, closely monitor patients for signs of \nIMBRUVICA lack of efficacy.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception while taking\nIMBRUVICA (see section 4.6).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIbrutinib is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).\n\nAgents that may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations\nConcomitant use of IMBRUVICA and medicinal products that strongly or moderately inhibit \nCYP3A4 can increase ibrutinib exposure and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.\n\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors\nCo-administration of ketoconazole, a very strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, \nincreased exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively. Simulations using \nfasted conditions suggested that the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin may increase the AUC of \nibrutinib by a factor of 14. In patients with B-cell malignancies taking IMBRUVICA with food, \nco-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole increased Cmax by 6.7-fold and AUC \nby 5.7-fold. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, \nsaquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodon, cobicistat, voriconazole and \nposaconazole) should be avoided. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \nmust be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA dose to 140 mg (one capsule) for the duration of the inhibitor \nuse or withhold IMBRUVICA temporarily (for 7 days or less). Monitor patient closely for toxicity and \nfollow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nModerate CYP3A4 inhibitors\nIn patients with B-cell malignancies taking IMBRUVICA with food, co-administration of the \nCYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin increased Cmax by 3.4-fold and AUC by 3.0-fold. If a moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, \ncrizotinib, diltiazem, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodarone and dronedarone) is indicated, \nreduce IMBRUVICA dose to 280 mg (two capsules) for the duration of the inhibitor use. Monitor \npatient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nMild CYP3A4 inhibitors\nSimulations using fasted conditions suggested that the mild CYP3A4 inhibitors azithromycin and\nfluvoxamine may increase the AUC of ibrutinib by <2-fold. No dose adjustment is required in \ncombination with mild inhibitors. Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification \nguidance as needed.\n\nCo-administration of grapefruit juice, containing CYP3A4 inhibitors, in eight healthy subjects, \nincreased exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively. \n\n\n\n8\n\nGrapefruit and Seville oranges should be avoided during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain \nmoderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see section 4.2).\n\nAgents that may decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations\nAdministration of IMBRUVICA with inducers of CYP3A4 can decrease ibrutinib plasma \nconcentrations.\n\nCo-administration of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, decreased \nexposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 92 and 90%, respectively. Avoid concomitant use of strong \nor moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin). Preparations containing \nSt. John's Wort are contraindicated during treatment with IMBRUVICA, as efficacy may be reduced. \nConsider alternative agents with less CYP3A4 induction. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong\nor moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be used, monitor patient closely for lack of efficacy (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). Mild inducers may be used concomitantly with IMBRUVICA, however, patients \nshould be monitored for potential lack of efficacy.\n\nIbrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. A lower Cmax was observed \nin fasted healthy subjects administered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at \n40 mg once daily for 5 days (see section 5.2). There is no evidence that the lower Cmax would have \nclinical significance, and medicinal products that increase stomach pH (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) \nhave been used without restrictions in the pivotal clinical studies.\n\nAgents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by ibrutinib\nIbrutinib is a P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor in vitro. As no clinical data \nare available on this interaction, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P-gp and \nBCRP after a therapeutic dose. To minimise the potential for an interaction in the GI tract, oral narrow \ntherapeutic range, P-gp or BCRP substrates such as digoxin or methotrexate should be taken at least \n6 hours before or after IMBRUVICA. Ibrutinib may also inhibit BCRP in the liver and increase the\nexposure of medicinal products that undergo BCRP-mediated hepatic efflux, such as rosuvastatin.\n\nIn a drug interaction study in patients with B-cell malignancies, a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib did \nnot have a clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. In the \nsame study, 2 weeks of treatment with ibrutinib at 560 mg daily had no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel), the CYP3A4 substrate \nmidazolam, nor the CYP2B6 substrate bupropion.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/Contraception in females\nBased on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA and for up to 3 months \nafter ending treatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective \ncontraceptive measures while taking IMBRUVICA and for three months after stopping treatment. \n\nPregnancy\nIMBRUVICA should not be used during pregnancy. There are no data from the use of IMBRUVICA\nin pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether ibrutinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed \nchildren cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \nIMBRUVICA.\n\nFertility\nNo effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the \nmaximum dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (Human Equivalent Dose [HED] 16 mg/kg/day) (see \nsection 5.3). No human data on the effects of ibrutinib on fertility are available.\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nIMBRUVICA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nFatigue, dizziness and asthenia have been reported in some patients taking IMBRUVICA and should \nbe considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile is based on pooled data from 1200 patients treated with IMBRUVICA in three \nphase 2 clinical studies and six randomised phase 3 studies and from post-marketing experience. \nPatients treated for MCL in clinical studies received IMBRUVICA at 560 mg once daily and patients \ntreated for CLL or WM in clinical studies received IMBRUVICA at 420 mg once daily. All patients in \nclinical studies received IMBRUVICA until disease progression or no longer tolerated.\n\nThe most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhoea, rash, haemorrhage (e.g., \nbruising), neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. The most common\ngrade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥5%) were neutropenia, pneumonia, and thrombocytopenia.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions in patients treated with ibrutinib for B-cell malignancies and post-marketing adverse \nreactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are defined as\nfollows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies or during post marketing \nsurveillance in patients with B-cell malignancies†\n\nSystem organ class Frequency\n(All grades)\n\nAdverse reactions All \nGrades \n\n(%)\nGrade ≥3 \n\n(%)\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nVery common Pneumonia*#\n\nUpper respiratory tract infection\nSkin infection*\n\n16\n18\n14\n\n10\n1\n3\n\nCommon Sepsis*#\n\nUrinary tract infection\nSinusitis*\n\n5\n10\n10\n\n4\n2\n1\n\nUncommon Cryptococcal infections* <1 0\n\nPneumocystis infections* # 1 1\n\nAspergillus infections* 1 <1\n\nHepatitis B reactivation@ # <1 <1\n\nNeoplasms benign and \nmalignant (incl cysts and \npolyps)\n\nCommon Non-melanoma skin cancer*\n\nBasal cell carcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma\n\n6\n3\n2\n\n1\n<1\n<1\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nVery common Neutropenia\nThrombocytopenia\n\n30\n21\n\n26\n10\n\nCommon Febrile neutropenia\nLeukocytosis\nLymphocytosis\n\n5\n2\n1\n\n5\n1\n1\n\nRare Leukostasis syndrome <1 <1\nImmune system disorders Common Interstitial lung disease*,#,a 2 <1\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nCommon Tumour lysis syndromea\n\nHyperuricaemia\n\n1\n8\n\n1\n2\n\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache 13 1\nCommon Peripheral neuropathy*,a\n\nDizziness\n\n5\n9\n\n<1\n0\n\n\n\n10\n\nUncommon Cerebrovascular accident a, #\n\nTransient ischaemic attacka\n\nIschaemic stroke a, #\n\n<1\n1\n\n<1\n\n<1\n<1\n<1\n\nEye disorders Common Vision blurred 7 0\nCardiac disorders Common Cardiac failurea,*\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n2\n7\n\n1\n4\n\nUncommon Ventricular tachyarrhythmia*,a,b 1 <1\n\nVascular disorders Very common Haemorrhage*#\n\nBruising*\n\nHypertension*\n\n31\n22\n12\n\n1\n1\n5\n\nCommon Epistaxis\nPetechiae\n\n8\n7\n\n<1\n0\n\nUncommon Subdural haematoma# 1 1\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Diarrhoea\nVomiting\nStomatitis*\n\nNausea\nConstipation\n\n39\n13\n12\n25\n16\n\n3\n<1\n1\n1\n\n<1\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon Hepatic failure*,a # <1 <1\n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nVery common Rash* 31 3\n\nCommon Urticariaa\n\nErythemaa\n\nOnychoclasisa\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n<1\n0\n0\n\nUncommon Angioedemaa\n\nPanniculitis*,a\n\nNeutrophilic dermatoses*, a\n\n<1\n1\n\n<1\n\n<1\n0\n\n<1\n\nNot known Stevens-Johnson syndromea Not known Not known\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders\n\nVery common Arthralgia\nMuscle spasms\nMusculoskeletal pain*\n\n14\n14\n30\n\n1\n<1\n3\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nVery common Pyrexia\nOedema peripheral\n\n20\n15\n\n2\n1\n\n† Frequencies are rounded to the nearest integer.\n* Includes multiple adverse reaction terms.\n# Includes events with fatal outcome.\n@ Lower level term (LLT) used for selection.\na Spontaneous reports from post-marketing experience.\nb Frequency calculated from monotherapy clinical studies.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nDiscontinuation and dose reduction due to adverse reactions\nOf the 1200 patients treated with IMBRUVICA for B-cell malignancies, 5% discontinued treatment \nprimarily due to adverse reactions. These included pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, haemorrhage, and \nthrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in approximately 7% of \npatients.\n\nElderly\nOf the 1200 patients treated with IMBRUVICA, 64% were 65 years of age or older. Grade 3 or higher \npneumonia occurred more frequently among elderly patients treated with IMBRUVICA (12% of \npatients age ≥65 versus 7% of patients <65 years of age).\n\nLong-term safety\nThe long-term safety data over 5 years from 1178 patients (treatment-naïve CLL/SLL n = 162, \nrelapsed/refractory CLL/SLL n = 646, and relapsed/refractory MCL n = 370) treated with \nIMBRUVICA were analysed. The median duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 51 months (range, \n0.2 to 98 months) with 70% and 52% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and \n4 years, respectively. The median duration of treatment for MCL was 11 months (range, 0 to \n\n\n\n11\n\n87 months) with 31% and 17% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years, \nrespectively. The overall known safety profile of IMBRUVICA-exposed patients remained consistent, \nother than an increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new safety concerns identified. The \nprevalence for Grade 3 or greater hypertension was 4% (year 0-1), 6% (year 1-2), 8% (year 2-3), 9% \n(year 3-4), and 9% (year 4-5). The incidence for the 5-year period was 11%.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere are limited data on the effects of IMBRUVICA overdose. No maximum tolerated dose was \nreached in the phase 1 study in which patients received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1,400 mg/day). In a \nseparate study, one healthy subject who received a dose of 1,680 mg experienced reversible grade 4 \nhepatic enzyme increases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)].\nThere is no specific antidote for IMBRUVICA. Patients who ingested more than the recommended \ndose should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE27.\n\nMechanism of action\nIbrutinib is a potent, small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Ibrutinib forms a \ncovalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the BTK active site, leading to sustained inhibition \nof BTK enzymatic activity. BTK, a member of the Tec kinase family, is an important signalling\nmolecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. The BCR pathway is \nimplicated in the pathogenesis of several B-cell malignancies, including MCL, diffuse large B-cell \nlymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and CLL. BTK’s pivotal role in signalling through the \nB-cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis \nand adhesion. Preclinical studies have shown that ibrutinib effectively inhibits malignant B-cell \nproliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.\n\nLymphocytosis\nUpon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (i.e., ≥50% increase from \nbaseline and an absolute count >5,000/mcL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy, has \nbeen observed in about three fourths of patients with CLL treated with IMBRUVICA. This effect has \nalso been observed in about one third of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL treated with \nIMBRUVICA. This observed lymphocytosis is a pharmacodynamic effect and should not be \nconsidered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings. In both disease types, \nlymphocytosis typically occurs during the first month of IMBRUVICA therapy and typically resolves \nwithin a median of 8.0 weeks in patients with MCL and 14 weeks in patients with CLL. A large \nincrease in the number of circulating lymphocytes (e.g., >400,000/mcL) has been observed in some \npatients.\n\nLymphocytosis was not observed in patients with WM treated with IMBRUVICA.\n\nIn vitro platelet aggregation\nIn an in vitro study, ibrutinib demonstrated inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. \nIbrutinib did not show meaningful inhibition of platelet aggregation using other agonists of platelet \naggregation.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12\n\nEffect on QT/QTc interval and cardiac electrophysiology\nThe effect of ibrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 20 healthy male and female subjects in a \nrandomised, double-blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls. At a supratherapeutic \ndose of 1,680 mg, ibrutinib did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. The \nlargest upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the baseline adjusted mean differences between \nibrutinib and placebo was below 10 ms. In this same study, a concentration dependent shortening in \nthe QTc interval was observed (-5.3 ms [90% CI: -9.4, -1.1] at a Cmax of 719 ng/mL following the \nsupratherapeutic dose of 1,680 mg).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nMCL\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL were evaluated \nin a single open-label, multi-center phase 2 study (PCYC-1104-CA) of 111 patients. The median age \nwas 68 years (range: 40 to 84 years), 77% were male and 92% were Caucasian. Patients with Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3 or greater were excluded from the \nstudy. The median time since diagnosis was 42 months, and median number of prior treatments was \n3 (range: 1 to 5 treatments), including 35% with prior high-dose chemotherapy, 43% with prior \nbortezomib, 24% with prior lenalidomide, and 11% with prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell \ntransplant. At baseline, 39% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 49% had high-risk score by \nSimplified MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI), and 72% had advanced disease (extranodal \nand/or bone marrow involvement) at screening.\n\nIMBRUVICA was administered orally at 560 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable \ntoxicity. Tumour response was assessed according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) \nfor non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) criteria. The primary endpoint in this study was \ninvestigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR). Responses to IMBRUVICA are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: ORR and DOR in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL (Study\nPCYC-1104-CA)\n\nTotal\nN=111\n\nORR (%) 67.6\n95% CI (%) (58.0; 76.1)\nCR (%) 20.7\nPR (%) 46.8\nMedian DOR (CR+PR) (months) 17.5 (15.8, NR)\nMedian time to initial response, months (range) 1.9 (1.4-13.7)\nMedian time to CR, months (range) 5.5 (1.7-11.5)\nCI=confidence interval; CR=complete response; DOR=duration of response; ORR=overall response rate; PR=partial \nresponse; NR=not reached\n\nThe efficacy data was further evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) demonstrating an \nORR of 69%, with a 21% complete response (CR) rate and a 48% partial response (PR) rate. The IRC \nestimated median DOR was 19.6 months.\n\nThe overall response to IMBRUVICA was independent of prior treatment including bortezomib and \nlenalidomide or underlying risk/prognostic factors, bulky disease, gender or age.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA were demonstrated in a randomised phase 3, open-label, \nmulticenter study including 280 patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy (Study \nMCL3001). Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA orally at 560 mg once daily \nfor 21 days or temsirolimus intravenously at 175 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of the first cycle followed by \n75 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of each subsequent 21-day cycle. Treatment on both arms continued until \ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years (range, 34; 88 years), 74% \nwere male and 87% were Caucasian. The median time since diagnosis was 43 months, and median \nnumber of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 9 treatments), including 51% with prior high-dose \n\n\n\n13\n\nchemotherapy, 18% with prior bortezomib, 5% with prior lenalidomide, and 24% with prior stem cell \ntransplant. At baseline, 53% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 21% had high-risk score by \nSimplified MIPI, 60% had extranodal disease and 54% had bone marrow involvement at screening.\n\nProgression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to the revised International Working \nGroup (IWG) for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) criteria. Efficacy results for Study MCL3001 are \nshown in Table 3 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS in Figure 1.\n\nTable 3: Efficacy Results in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL (Study MCL3001)\nEndpoint IMBRUVICA\n\nN=139\nTemsirolimus\n\nN=141\nPFSa\n\nMedian PFS (95% CI), (months)\n14.6 (10.4, NE) 6.2 (4.2, 7.9)\n\nHR=0.43 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.58]\nORR (%) 71.9 40.4\np-value p<0.0001\nNE=not estimable; HR=hazard ratio; CI=confidence interval; ORR=overall response rate; PFS=progression-free survival\na IRC evaluated.\n\nA smaller proportion of patients treated with ibrutinib experienced a clinically meaningful worsening \nof lymphoma symptoms versus temsirolimus (27% versus 52%) and time to worsening of symptoms \noccurred more slowly with ibrutinib versus temsirolimus (HR 0.27, p<0.0001).\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study MCL3001\n\n\n\n14\n\nCLL\nPatients previously untreated for CLL\nSingle agent\nA randomised, multicenter, open-label phase 3 study (PCYC-1115-CA) of IMBRUVICA versus \nchlorambucil was conducted in patients with treatment-naïve CLL who were 65 years of age or older. \nPatients between 65 and 70 years of age were required to have at least one comorbidity that precluded\nthe use of frontline chemo-immunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.\nPatients (n=269) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity, or chlorambucil at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 \nof each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 12 cycles, with an allowance for intrapatient dose increases up \nto 0.8 mg/kg based on tolerability. After confirmed disease progression, patients on chlorambucil were \nable to crossover to ibrutinib.\n\nThe median age was 73 years (range, 65 to 90 years), 63% were male, and 91% were Caucasian. \nNinety one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and 9% had an \nECOG performance status of 2. The study enrolled 269 patients with CLL. At baseline, 45% had \nadvanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 35% of patients had at least one tumor ≥5 cm, 39% with \nbaseline anaemia, 23% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 65% had elevated β2 microglobulin \n>3500 mcg/L, 47% had a CrCL <60 mL/min, 20% of patients presented with del11q, 6% of patients \npresented with del17p/tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutation, and 44% of patients presented with \nunmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV).\n\nProgression free survival (PFS) as assessed by IRC according to International Workshop on CLL\n(IWCLL) criteria indicated an 84% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression \nin the IMBRUVICA arm. Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1115-CA are shown in Table 4 and the \nKaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nThere was a statistically significant sustained platelet or haemoglobin improvement in the ITT \npopulation in favor of ibrutinib versus chlorambucil. In patients with baseline cytopenias, sustained \nhaematologic improvement was: platelets 77.1% versus 42.9%; haemoglobin 84.3% versus 45.5% for \nibrutinib and chlorambucil respectively.\n\nTable 4: Efficacy results in Study PCYC-1115-CA\nEndpoint IMBRUVICA\n\nN=136\nChlorambucil\n\nN=133\nPFSa\n\nNumber of events (%) 15 (11.0) 64 (48.1)\nMedian (95% CI), months Not reached 18.9 (14.1, 22.0)\nHR (95% CI) 0.161 (0.091, 0.283)\nORRa (CR+PR) 82.4% 35.3%\nP-value <0.0001\nOSb\n\nNumber of deaths (%) 3 (2.2) 17 (12.8)\nHR (95% CI) 0.163 (0.048, 0.558)\nCI=confidence interval; HR=hazard ratio; CR=complete response; ORR=overall response rate; OS=overall survival; \nPFS=progression-free survival; PR=partial response\na IRC evaluated, median follow-up 18.4 months.\nb Median OS not reached for both arms. p<0.005 for OS\n\n\n\n15\n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1115-CA\n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier curve of OS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1115-CA\n\n48-month follow-up\nWith a median follow-up time on study of 48 months in Study PCYC-1115-CA and its extension \nstudy, an 86% reduction in the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was observed \nfor patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. The median investigator-assessed PFS was not reached in the \nIMBRUVICA arm and was 15 months [95% CI (10.22, 19.35)] in the chlorambucil arm; (HR=0.14 \n[95% CI (0.09, 0.21)]). The 4-year PFS estimate was 73.9% in the IMBRUVICA arm and 15.5% in \n\n\n\n16\n\nthe chlorambucil arm, respectively. The updated Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 4. \nThe investigator-assessed ORR was 91.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm versus 36.8% in the chlorambucil \narm. The CR rate according to IWCLL criteria was 16.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm versus 3.0% in the \nchlorambucil arm. At the time of long-term follow-up, a total of 73 subjects (54.9%) originally \nrandomised to the chlorambucil arm subsequently received ibrutinib as cross-over treatment. The \nKaplan-Meier landmark estimate for OS at 48-months was 85.5% in the IMBRUVICA arm.\n\nThe treatment effect of ibrutinib in Study PCYC-1115-CA was consistent across high-risk patients \nwith del17p/TP53 mutation, del11q, and/or unmutated IGHV.\n\nFigure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1115-CA with 48 \nMonths Follow-up\n\nCombination therapy\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with treatment naïve CLL/SLL were further \nevaluated in a randomised, multi-center, open-label, phase 3 study (PCYC-1130-CA) of IMBRUVICA \nin combination with obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. The study \nenrolled patients who were 65 years of age or older or <65 years of age with coexisting medical \nconditions, reduced renal function as measured by creatinine clearance <70 mL/min, or presence of \ndel17p/TP53 mutation. Patients (n=229) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg \ndaily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or chlorambucil at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg on \nDays 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. In both arms, patients received 1000 mg of \nobinutuzumab on Days 1, 8 and 15 of the first cycle, followed by treatment on the first day of \n5 subsequent cycles (total of 6 cycles, 28 days each). The first dose of obinutuzumab was divided \nbetween day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg). \n\nThe median age was 71 years (range, 40 to 87 years), 64% were male, and 96% were Caucasian.

The open-label, multi-center study (PCYC-1102-CA) \nincluded 51 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, who received 420 mg once daily. IMBRUVICA\nwas administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years \n(range: 37 to 82 years), median time since diagnosis was 80 months, and median number of prior \ntreatments was 4 (range: 1 to 12 treatments), including 92.2% with a prior nucleoside analog, 98.0% \nwith prior rituximab, 86.3% with a prior alkylator, 39.2% with prior bendamustine and 19.6% with \nprior ofatumumab.

At a median \nduration follow up of 16.4 months, the ORR by IRC for the 51 relapsed or refractory patients was \n64.7% (95% CI: 50.1%; 77.6%), all PRs. The ORR including PR with lymphocytosis was 70.6%.\nMedian time to response was 1.9 months. The DOR ranged from 3.9 to 24.2+ months. The median \nDOR was not reached.\n\nA randomised, multi-center, open-label phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA versus ofatumumab \n(PCYC-1112-CA) was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Patients (n=391) were \nrandomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable \n\n\n\n19\n\ntoxicity, or ofatumumab for up to 12 doses (300/2,000 mg). Fifty-seven patients randomised to \nofatumumab crossed over following progression to receive IMBRUVICA. The median age was \n67 years (range: 30 to 88 years), 68% were male, and 90% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline \nECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 91 months and the median \nnumber of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 13 treatments). At baseline, 58% of patients had at least \none tumour ≥5 cm.

With a median \nfollow-up time on study of 34 months (range, 8.6+ to 37.7 months), the median duration of response \nhas not been reached.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIMBRUVICA in all subsets of the paediatric population in MCL, CLL and lymphoplasmacytic \nlymphoma (LPL) (for information on paediatric use, see section 4.2).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nIbrutinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a median Tmax of 1 to 2 hours. Absolute \nbioavailability in fasted condition (n=8) was 2.9% (90% CI=2.1 – 3.9) and doubled when combined \nwith a meal. Pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib does not significantly differ in patients with different B-cell \nmalignancies. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The steady state AUC observed \nin patients at 560 mg is (mean ± standard deviation) 953 ± 705 ng h/mL. Administration of ibrutinib in \nfasted condition resulted in approximately 60% of exposure (AUClast) as compared to either \n30 minutes before, 30 minutes after (fed condition) or 2 hours after a high fat breakfast.\n\n\n\n25\n\nIbrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. In fasted healthy subjects \nadministered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at 40 mg once daily for 5 days, \ncompared to ibrutinib alone, geometric mean ratios (90% CI) were 83% (68-102%), 92% (78-110%), \nand 38% (26-53%) for AUC0-24, AUClast, and Cmax, respectively.\n\nDistribution\nReversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97.3% with no concentration \ndependence in the range of 50 to 1,000 ng/mL. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state \n(Vd, ss/F) was approximately 10,000 L.\n\nMetabolism\nIbrutinib is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 to produce a dihydrodiol metabolite with an inhibitory \nactivity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than that of ibrutinib. Involvement of CYP2D6 in\nthe metabolism of ibrutinib appears to be minimal.\n\nTherefore, no precautions are necessary in patients with different CYP2D6 genotypes.\n\nElimination\nApparent clearance (CL/F) is approximately 1,000 L/h. The half-life of ibrutinib is 4 to 13 hours.\nAfter a single oral administration of radiolabeled [14C]-ibrutinib in healthy subjects, approximately \n90% of radioactivity was excreted within 168 hours, with the majority (80%) excreted in the faeces \nand <10% accounted for in urine. Unchanged ibrutinib accounted for approximately 1% of the \nradiolabeled excretion product in faeces and none in urine.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicated that age does not significantly influence ibrutinib clearance \nfrom the circulation.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo pharmacokinetic studies were performed with IMBRUVICA in patients under 18 years of age.\n\nGender\nPopulation pharmacokinetics data indicated that gender does not significantly influence ibrutinib \nclearance from the circulation.\n\nRace\nThere are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics.\n\nBody weight\nPopulation pharmacokinetics data indicated that body weight (range: 41-146 kg; mean [SD]: \n83 [19 kg]) had a negligible effect on ibrutinib clearance.\n\nRenal impairment\nIbrutinib has minimal renal clearance; urinary excretion of metabolites is <10% of the dose. No \nspecific studies have been conducted to date in subjects with impaired renal function. There are no \ndata in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nIbrutinib is metabolised in the liver. A hepatic impairment trial was performed in non-cancer subjects \nadministered a single dose of 140 mg of medicinal product under fasting conditions. The effect of \nimpaired liver function varied substantially between individuals, but on average a 2.7-, 8.2-, and \n9.8-fold increase in ibrutinib exposure (AUClast) was observed in subjects with mild (n=6, Child-Pugh\nclass A), moderate (n=10, Child-Pugh class B) and severe (n=8, Child-Pugh class C) hepatic \nimpairment, respectively. The free fraction of ibrutinib also increased with degree of impairment, with \n3.0, 3.8 and 4.8% in subjects with mild, moderate and severe liver impairment, respectively, compared \n\n\n\n26\n\nto 3.3% in plasma from matched healthy controls within this study. The corresponding increase in \nunbound ibrutinib exposure (AUCunbound, last) is estimated to be 4.1-, 9.8-, and 13-fold in subjects with \nmild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively (see section 4.2).\n\nCo-administration with transport substrates/inhibitors\nIn vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-gp, nor other major transporters, except \nOCT2. The dihydrodiol metabolite and other metabolites are P-gp substrates. Ibrutinib is an in vitro\ninhibitor of P-gp and BCRP (see section 4.5).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe following adverse effects were seen in studies of 13-weeks duration in rats and dogs. Ibrutinib \nwas found to induce gastrointestinal effects (soft faeces/diarrhoea and/or inflammation) and lymphoid \ndepletion in rats and dogs with a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day in \nboth species. Based on mean exposure (AUC) at the 560 mg/day clinical dose, AUC ratios were \n2.6 and 21 at the NOAEL in male and female rats, and 0.4 and 1.8 at the NOAEL in male and female \ndogs, respectively. Lowest Observed Effect Level (LOEL) (60 mg/kg/day) margins in the dog are \n3.6-fold (males) and 2.3-fold (females). In rats, moderate pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (considered \nadverse) was observed at doses of ≥100 mg/kg in male rats (AUC exposure margin of 2.6-fold) and \nnot observed in females at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 21.3-fold). Mildly \ndecreased trabecular and cortical bone was seen in female rats administered ≥100 mg/kg/day (AUC \nexposure margin of 20.3-fold). All gastrointestinal, lymphoid and bone findings recovered following \nrecovery periods of 6-13 weeks. Pancreatic findings partially recovered during comparable reversal \nperiods.\n\nJuvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted.\n\nCarcinogenicity/genotoxicity\nIbrutinib was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse at oral doses up \nto 2000 mg/kg/day with an exposure margin of approximately 23 (males) to 37 (females) times the \nhuman AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily.\nIbrutinib has no genotoxic properties when tested in bacteria, mammalian cells or in mice.\n\nReproductive toxicity\nIn pregnant rats, ibrutinib at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day was associated with increased post-implantation \nloss and increased visceral (heart and major vessels) malformations and skeletal variations with an\nexposure margin 14 times the AUC found in patients at a daily dose of 560 mg. At a dose of \n≥40 mg/kg/day, ibrutinib was associated with decreased foetal weights (AUC ratio of ≥5.6 as \ncompared to daily dose of 560 mg in patients). Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 1.3 times the AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily) (see section 4.6).\n\nIn pregnant rabbits, ibrutinib at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day or greater was associated with skeletal \nmalformations (fused sternebrae) and ibrutinib at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day was associated with \nincreased post-implantation loss. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rabbits at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 2.0 times the exposure (AUC) in patients with MCL administered ibrutinib 560 mg \ndaily and 2.8 times the exposure in patients with CLL or WM receiving ibrutinib dose 420 mg per \nday). Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the AUC of \nibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily) (see section 4.6).\n\nFertility\nNo effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the \nmaximum dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (HED 16 mg/kg/day).\n\n\n\n27\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nIMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or \nrefractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).\n\nIMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (see section 5.1).\n\nIMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is indicated \nfor the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.\n\nIMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s \nmacroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for \npatients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab is \nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with WM.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with this medicinal product should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced \nin the use of anticancer medicinal products.\n\nPosology\nMCL\nThe recommended dose for the treatment of MCL is 560 mg once daily.\n\nCLL and WM\nThe recommended dose for the treatment of CLL, either as a single agent or in combination, is 420 mg \nonce daily (for details of the combination regimen, see section 5.1).\nThe recommended dose for the treatment of WM is 420 mg once daily.\n\nTreatment should continue until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the patient.\n\nWhen administering IMBRUVICA in combination with anti-CD20 therapies, it is recommended to \nadminister IMBRUVICA prior to rituximab or obinutuzumab when given on the same day.\n\nDose adjustments\nModerate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of ibrutinib (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nThe dose of ibrutinib should be reduced to 280 mg once daily when used concomitantly with moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitors.\n\nThe dose of ibrutinib should be reduced to 140 mg once daily or withheld for up to 7 days when it is \nused concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n\nIMBRUVICA therapy should be withheld for any new onset or worsening \ngrade ≥3 non-haematological toxicity, grade 3 or greater neutropenia with infection or fever, or \ngrade 4 haematological toxicities. Once the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to grade 1 or \nbaseline (recovery), IMBRUVICA therapy may be reinitiated at the starting dose. If the toxicity \nreoccurs, the once daily dose should be reduced by 140 mg. A second reduction of dose by 140 mg \nmay be considered as needed. If these toxicities persist or recur following two dose reductions, \ndiscontinue the medicinal product.\n\n\n\n31\n\nRecommended dose modifications are described below:\n\nToxicity \noccurrence\n\nMCL dose modification after \nrecovery\n\nCLL/WM dose modification after \nrecovery\n\nFirst restart at 560 mg daily restart at 420 mg daily\nSecond restart at 420 mg daily restart at 280 mg daily\nThird restart at 280 mg daily restart at 140 mg daily\nFourth discontinue IMBRUVICA discontinue IMBRUVICA\n\nMissed dose\nIf a dose is not taken at the scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a \nreturn to the normal schedule the following day. The patient should not take extra tablets to make up \nthe missed dose.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo specific dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥65 years).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild \nor moderate renal impairment were treated in IMBRUVICA clinical studies. No dose adjustment is \nneeded for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine \nclearance). Hydration should be maintained and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically. \nAdminister IMBRUVICA to patients with severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min creatinine clearance) \nonly if the benefit outweighs the risk and monitor patients closely for signs of toxicity. There are no \ndata in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nIbrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In a hepatic impairment study, data showed an increase in \nibrutinib exposure (see section 5.2). For patients with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh class A), the \nrecommended dose is 280 mg daily. For patients with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass B), the recommended dose is 140 mg daily. Monitor patients for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity \nand follow dose modification guidance as needed. It is not recommended to administer IMBRUVICA \nto patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).\n\nSevere cardiac disease\nPatients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from IMBRUVICA clinical studies.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nIMBRUVICA should be administered orally once daily with a glass of water approximately at the \nsame time each day. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and should not be broken or \nchewed. IMBRUVICA must not be taken with grapefruit juice or Seville oranges (see section 4.5).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nUse of preparations containing St. John’s Wort is contraindicated in patients treated with \nIMBRUVICA.\n\n\n\n32\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBleeding-related events\nThere have been reports of bleeding events in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, both with and \nwithout thrombocytopenia. These include minor bleeding events such as contusion, epistaxis, and \npetechiae; and major bleeding events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial \nhaemorrhage, and haematuria.\n\nWarfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with \nIMBRUVICA.\n\nUse of either anticoagulants or medicinal products that inhibit platelet function (antiplatelet agents) \nconcomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major bleeding. A higher risk for major \nbleeding was observed with anticoagulant than with antiplatelet agents. Consider the risks and benefits \nof anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs \nand symptoms of bleeding.\n\nSupplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided.\n\nIMBRUVICA should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of \nsurgery and the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe mechanism for the bleeding-related events is not fully understood. Patients with congenital \nbleeding diathesis have not been studied.\n\nLeukostasis\nCases of leukostasis have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. A high number of \ncirculating lymphocytes (>400,000/mcL) may confer increased risk. Consider temporarily withholding \nIMBRUVICA. Patients should be closely monitored. Administer supportive care including hydration \nand/or cytoreduction as indicated.\n\nSplenic rupture\nCases of splenic rupture have been reported following discontinuation of IMBRUVICA treatment. \nDisease status and spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound) \nwhen IMBRUVICA treatment is interrupted or ceased. Patients who develop left upper abdominal or \nshoulder tip pain should be evaluated and a diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered.\n\nInfections\nInfections (including sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in \npatients treated with IMBRUVICA. Some of these infections have been associated with hospitalisation \nand death. Most patients with fatal infections also had neutropenia. Patients should be monitored for \nfever, neutropenia and infections and appropriate anti-infective therapy should be instituted as \nindicated. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for \nopportunistic infections.\n\nCases of invasive fungal infections, including cases of Aspergillosis, Cryptococcosis and \nPneumocystis jiroveci infections have been reported following the use of ibrutinib. Reported cases of \ninvasive fungal infections have been associated with fatal outcomes.\n\nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) including fatal ones have been reported \nfollowing the use of ibrutinib within the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. \nPhysicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening \nneurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected then appropriate \ndiagnostic evaluations should be undertaken and treatment suspended until PML is excluded. If any \ndoubt exists, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML including MRI \nscan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat \nneurological assessments should be considered.\n\n\n\n33\n\nCytopenias\nTreatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) were \nreported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor complete blood counts monthly.\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)\nCases of ILD have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor patients for \npulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. If symptoms develop, interrupt IMBRUVICA and manage \nILD appropriately. If symptoms persist, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and \nfollow the dose modification guidelines.\n\nCardiac arrhythmia and cardiac failure \nAtrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and cardiac failure have been \nreported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Cases of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been \nreported particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a \nprevious history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor all patients clinically for cardiac \nmanifestations, including cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac failure. Patients who develop arrhythmic \nsymptoms or new onset of dyspnoea, dizziness or fainting should be evaluated clinically and if \nindicated have an electrocardiogram (ECG) performed.\n\nIn patients who develop signs and/or symptoms of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, IMBRUVICA should \nbe temporarily discontinued and a thorough clinical benefit/risk assessment should be performed \nbefore possibly restarting therapy.\n\nIn patients with preexisting atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy, alternative treatment \noptions to IMBRUVICA should be considered. In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy \nwith IMBRUVICA a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be \nundertaken. In patients at high risk and where alternatives to IMBRUVICA are non-suitable, tightly \ncontrolled treatment with anticoagulants should be considered.\n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of cardiac failure during IMBRUVICA\ntreatment. In some of these cases cardiac failure resolved or improved after IMBRUVICA withdrawal \nor dose reduction. \n\nCerebrovascular accidents\nCases of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke including fatalities \nhave been reported with the use of ibrutinib, with and without concomitant atrial fibrillation and/or \nhypertension. Latency from the initiation of treatment with ibrutinib to the onset of ischaemic central \nnervous vascular conditions was in the most cases after several months (more than 1 month in 78% \nand more than 6 months in 44% of cases) emphasising the need for regular monitoring of patients \n(please see section 4.4 Cardiac arrhythmia and Hypertension and section 4.8).\n\nTumour lysis syndrome\nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Patients at risk of tumour lysis \nsyndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. Monitor patients closely and take \nappropriate precautions.\n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer\nNon-melanoma skin cancers were reported more frequently in patients treated with IMBRUVICA than \nin patients treated with comparators in pooled comparative randomised phase 3 studies. Monitor \npatients for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer.\n\nViral reactivation\nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including fatal events, have been reported in patients receiving \nIMBRUVICA. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) status should be established before initiating treatment with \nIMBRUVICA. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with \nexpertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. If patients have positive hepatitis B serology, \n\n\n\n34\n\na liver disease expert should be consulted before the start of treatment and the patient should be \nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.\n\nHypertension\nHypertension has occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA (see section 4.8). Regularly monitor \nblood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA and initiate or adjust antihypertensive medication \nthroughout treatment with IMBRUVICA as appropriate.\n\nHaemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\nCases of HLH (including fatal cases) have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. HLH \nis a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterised by clinical signs and \nsymptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. HLH is characterised by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, \nhypertriglyceridaemia, high serum ferritin and cytopenias. Patients should be informed about \nsymptoms of HLH. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should \nbe evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered.\n\nDrug-drug interactions\nCo-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with IMBRUVICA may lead to increased \nibrutinib exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity. On the contrary, co-administration of \nCYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased IMBRUVICA exposure and consequently a risk for lack of \nefficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of IMBRUVICA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and strong or \nmoderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided whenever possible and co-administration should only \nbe considered when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. Patients should be \nclosely monitored for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity if a CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5). If a CYP3A4 inducer must be used, closely monitor patients for signs of \nIMBRUVICA lack of efficacy.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception while taking \nIMBRUVICA (see section 4.6).\n\nIntolerance to excipients\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIbrutinib is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).\n\nAgents that may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations\nConcomitant use of IMBRUVICA and medicinal products that strongly or moderately inhibit \nCYP3A4 can increase ibrutinib exposure and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.\n\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors\nCo-administration of ketoconazole, a very strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, \nincreased exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively. Simulations using \nfasted conditions suggested that the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin may increase the AUC of \nibrutinib by a factor of 14. In patients with B-cell malignancies taking IMBRUVICA with food, \nco-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole increased Cmax by 6.7-fold and AUC \nby 5.7-fold. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, \nsaquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodon, cobicistat, voriconazole and \nposaconazole) should be avoided. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \nmust be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA dose to 140 mg for the duration of the inhibitor use or \nwithhold IMBRUVICA temporarily (for 7 days or less). Monitor patient closely for toxicity and \nfollow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n35\n\nModerate CYP3A4 inhibitors\nIn patients with B-cell malignancies taking IMBRUVICA with food, co-administration of the \nCYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin increased Cmax by 3.4-fold and AUC by 3.0-fold. If a moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, \ncrizotinib, diltiazem, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodarone and dronedarone) is indicated, \nreduce IMBRUVICA dose to 280 mg for the duration of the inhibitor use. Monitor patient closely for \ntoxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nMild CYP3A4 inhibitors\nSimulations using fasted conditions suggested that the mild CYP3A4 inhibitors azithromycin and \nfluvoxamine may increase the AUC of ibrutinib by <2-fold. No dose adjustment is required in \ncombination with mild inhibitors. Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification \nguidance as needed.\n\nCo-administration of grapefruit juice, containing CYP3A4 inhibitors, in eight healthy subjects, \nincreased exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively. \nGrapefruit and Seville oranges should be avoided during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain \nmoderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see section 4.2).\n\nAgents that may decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations\nAdministration of IMBRUVICA with inducers of CYP3A4 can decrease ibrutinib plasma \nconcentrations.\n\nCo-administration of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, decreased \nexposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 92 and 90%, respectively. Avoid concomitant use of strong \nor moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin). Preparations containing \nSt. John's Wort are contraindicated during treatment with IMBRUVICA, as efficacy may be reduced. \nConsider alternative agents with less CYP3A4 induction. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong \nor moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be used, monitor patient closely for lack of efficacy (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). Mild inducers may be used concomitantly with IMBRUVICA, however, patients \nshould be monitored for potential lack of efficacy.\n\nIbrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. A lower Cmax was observed \nin fasted healthy subjects administered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at \n40 mg once daily for 5 days (see section 5.2). There is no evidence that the lower Cmax would have \nclinical significance, and medicinal products that increase stomach pH (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) \nhave been used without restrictions in the pivotal clinical studies.\n\nAgents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by ibrutinib\nIbrutinib is a P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor in vitro. As no clinical data \nare available on this interaction, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P-gp and \nBCRP after a therapeutic dose. To minimise the potential for an interaction in the GI tract, oral narrow \ntherapeutic range, P-gp or BCRP substrates such as digoxin or methotrexate should be taken at least \n6 hours before or after IMBRUVICA. Ibrutinib may also inhibit BCRP in the liver and increase the \nexposure of medicinal products that undergo BCRP-mediated hepatic efflux, such as rosuvastatin.\n\nIn a drug interaction study in patients with B-cell malignancies, a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib did \nnot have a clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. In the \nsame study, 2 weeks of treatment with ibrutinib at 560 mg daily had no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel), the CYP3A4 substrate \nmidazolam, nor the CYP2B6 substrate bupropion.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/Contraception in females\nBased on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA and for up to 3 months \n\n\n\n36\n\nafter ending treatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective \ncontraceptive measures while taking IMBRUVICA and for three months after stopping treatment.\n\nPregnancy\nIMBRUVICA should not be used during pregnancy. There are no data from the use of IMBRUVICA \nin pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether ibrutinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed \nchildren cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \nIMBRUVICA.\n\nFertility\nNo effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the \nmaximum dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (Human Equivalent Dose [HED] 16 mg/kg/day) (see \nsection 5.3). No human data on the effects of ibrutinib on fertility are available.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nIMBRUVICA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nFatigue, dizziness and asthenia have been reported in some patients taking IMBRUVICA and should \nbe considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile is based on pooled data from 1200 patients treated with IMBRUVICA in three \nphase 2 clinical studies and six randomised phase 3 studies and from post-marketing experience. \nPatients treated for MCL in clinical studies received IMBRUVICA at 560 mg once daily and patients \ntreated for CLL or WM in clinical studies received IMBRUVICA at 420 mg once daily. All patients in \nclinical studies received IMBRUVICA until disease progression or no longer tolerated.\n\nThe most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhoea, rash, haemorrhage (e.g., \nbruising), neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and thrombocytopenia.

These included pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, haemorrhage, and \nthrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in approximately 7% of \npatients.\n\nElderly\nOf the 1200 patients treated with IMBRUVICA, 64% were 65 years of age or older. Grade 3 or higher \npneumonia occurred more frequently among elderly patients treated with IMBRUVICA (12% of \npatients age ≥65 versus 7% of patients <65 years of age).\n\nLong-term safety\nThe long-term safety data over 5 years from 1178 patients (treatment-naïve CLL/SLL n = 162, \nrelapsed/refractory CLL/SLL n = 646, and relapsed/refractory MCL n = 370) treated with \nIMBRUVICA were analysed. The median duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 51 months (range, \n0.2 to 98 months) with 70% and 52% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and \n4 years, respectively. The median duration of treatment for MCL was 11 months (range, 0 to \n87 months) with 31% and 17% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years, \nrespectively. The overall known safety profile of IMBRUVICA-exposed patients remained consistent, \nother than an increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new safety concerns identified. The \nprevalence for Grade 3 or greater hypertension was 4% (year 0-1), 6% (year 1-2), 8% (year 2-3), 9% \n(year 3-4), and 9% (year 4-5). The incidence for the 5-year period was 11%.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere are limited data on the effects of IMBRUVICA overdose. No maximum tolerated dose was \nreached in the phase 1 study in which patients received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1,400 mg/day). In a \nseparate study, one healthy subject who received a dose of 1,680 mg experienced reversible grade 4 \nhepatic enzyme increases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)]. \nThere is no specific antidote for IMBRUVICA. Patients who ingested more than the recommended \ndose should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE27.\n\nMechanism of action\nIbrutinib is a potent, small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Ibrutinib forms a \ncovalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the BTK active site, leading to sustained inhibition \nof BTK enzymatic activity. BTK, a member of the Tec kinase family, is an important signalling \nmolecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. The BCR pathway is \nimplicated in the pathogenesis of several B-cell malignancies, including MCL, diffuse large B-cell \nlymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and CLL. BTK’s pivotal role in signalling through the \nB-cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis \nand adhesion. Preclinical studies have shown that ibrutinib effectively inhibits malignant B-cell \nproliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n39\n\nLymphocytosis\nUpon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (i.e., ≥50% increase from \nbaseline and an absolute count >5,000/mcL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy, has \nbeen observed in about three fourths of patients with CLL treated with IMBRUVICA. This effect has \nalso been observed in about one third of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL treated with \nIMBRUVICA. This observed lymphocytosis is a pharmacodynamic effect and should not be \nconsidered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings. In both disease types, \nlymphocytosis typically occurs during the first month of IMBRUVICA therapy and typically resolves \nwithin a median of 8.0 weeks in patients with MCL and 14 weeks in patients with CLL. A large \nincrease in the number of circulating lymphocytes (e.g., >400,000/mcL) has been observed in some \npatients.\n\nLymphocytosis was not observed in patients with WM treated with IMBRUVICA.\n\nIn vitro platelet aggregation\nIn an in vitro study, ibrutinib demonstrated inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. \nIbrutinib did not show meaningful inhibition of platelet aggregation using other agonists of platelet \naggregation.\n\nEffect on QT/QTc interval and cardiac electrophysiology\nThe effect of ibrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 20 healthy male and female subjects in a \nrandomised, double-blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls. At a supratherapeutic \ndose of 1,680 mg, ibrutinib did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. The \nlargest upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the baseline adjusted mean differences between \nibrutinib and placebo was below 10 ms. In this same study, a concentration dependent shortening in \nthe QTc interval was observed (-5.3 ms [90% CI: -9.4, -1.1] at a Cmax of 719 ng/mL following the \nsupratherapeutic dose of 1,680 mg).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nMCL\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL were evaluated \nin a single open-label, multi-center phase 2 study (PCYC-1104-CA) of 111 patients. The median age \nwas 68 years (range: 40 to 84 years), 77% were male and 92% were Caucasian. Patients with Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3 or greater were excluded from the \nstudy. The median time since diagnosis was 42 months, and median number of prior treatments was \n3 (range: 1 to 5 treatments), including 35% with prior high-dose chemotherapy, 43% with prior \nbortezomib, 24% with prior lenalidomide, and 11% with prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell \ntransplant. At baseline, 39% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 49% had high-risk score by \nSimplified MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI), and 72% had advanced disease (extranodal \nand/or bone marrow involvement) at screening.\n\nIMBRUVICA was administered orally at 560 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable \ntoxicity. Tumour response was assessed according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) \nfor non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) criteria. The primary endpoint in this study was \ninvestigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR). Responses to IMBRUVICA are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: ORR and DOR in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL (Study \nPCYC-1104-CA)\n\nTotal\nN=111\n\nORR (%) 67.6\n95% CI (%) (58.0; 76.1)\nCR (%) 20.7\nPR (%) 46.8\nMedian DOR (CR+PR) (months) 17.5 (15.8, NR)\nMedian time to initial response, months (range) 1.9 (1.4-13.7)\nMedian time to CR, months (range) 5.5 (1.7-11.5)\n\n\n\n40\n\nCI=confidence interval; CR=complete response; DOR=duration of response; ORR=overall response rate; PR=partial \nresponse; NR=not reached\n\nThe efficacy data was further evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) demonstrating an \nORR of 69%, with a 21% complete response (CR) rate and a 48% partial response (PR) rate. The IRC \nestimated median DOR was 19.6 months.\n\nThe overall response to IMBRUVICA was independent of prior treatment including bortezomib and \nlenalidomide or underlying risk/prognostic factors, bulky disease, gender or age.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA were demonstrated in a randomised phase 3, open-label, \nmulticenter study including 280 patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy (Study \nMCL3001). Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA orally at 560 mg once daily \nfor 21 days or temsirolimus intravenously at 175 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of the first cycle followed by \n75 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of each subsequent 21-day cycle. Treatment on both arms continued until \ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years (range, 34; 88 years), 74% \nwere male and 87% were Caucasian. The median time since diagnosis was 43 months, and median \nnumber of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 9 treatments), including 51% with prior high-dose \nchemotherapy, 18% with prior bortezomib, 5% with prior lenalidomide, and 24% with prior stem cell \ntransplant. At baseline, 53% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 21% had high-risk score by \nSimplified MIPI, 60% had extranodal disease and 54% had bone marrow involvement at screening.\n\nProgression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to the revised International Working \nGroup (IWG) for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) criteria. Efficacy results for Study MCL3001 are \nshown in Table 3 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS in Figure 1.\n\nTable 3: Efficacy Results in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL (Study MCL3001)\nEndpoint IMBRUVICA\n\nN=139\nTemsirolimus\n\nN=141\nPFSa\n\nMedian PFS (95% CI), (months)\n14.6 (10.4, NE) 6.2 (4.2, 7.9)\n\nHR=0.43 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.58]\nORR (%) 71.9 40.4\np-value p<0.0001\nNE=not estimable; HR=hazard ratio; CI=confidence interval; ORR=overall response rate; PFS=progression-free survival\na IRC evaluated.\n\nA smaller proportion of patients treated with ibrutinib experienced a clinically meaningful worsening \nof lymphoma symptoms versus temsirolimus (27% versus 52%) and time to worsening of symptoms \noccurred more slowly with ibrutinib versus temsirolimus (HR 0.27, p<0.0001).\n\n\n\n41\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study MCL3001\n\nCLL\nPatients previously untreated for CLL\nSingle agent\nA randomised, multicenter, open-label phase 3 study (PCYC-1115-CA) of IMBRUVICA versus \nchlorambucil was conducted in patients with treatment-naïve CLL who were 65 years of age or older. \nPatients between 65 and 70 years of age were required to have at least one comorbidity that precluded \nthe use of frontline chemo-immunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. \nPatients (n=269) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity, or chlorambucil at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg on days 1 and \n15 of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 12 cycles, with an allowance for intrapatient dose increases \nup to 0.8 mg/kg based on tolerability. After confirmed disease progression, patients on chlorambucil \nwere able to crossover to ibrutinib.\n\nThe median age was 73 years (range, 65 to 90 years), 63% were male, and 91% were Caucasian. \nNinety one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and 9% had an \nECOG performance status of 2. The study enrolled 269 patients with CLL. At baseline, 45% had \nadvanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 35% of patients had at least one tumor ≥5 cm, 39% with \nbaseline anaemia, 23% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 65% had elevated β2 microglobulin \n>3500 mcg/L, 47% had a CrCL<60 mL/min, 20% of patients presented with del11q, 6% of patients \npresented with del17p/tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutation, and 44% of patients presented with \nunmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV).\n\nProgression free survival (PFS) as assessed by IRC according to International Workshop on CLL \n(IWCLL) criteria indicated an 84% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression \nin the IMBRUVICA arm. Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1115-CA are shown in Table 4 and the \nKaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\n\n\n\n42\n\nThere was a statistically significant sustained platelet or haemoglobin improvement in the ITT \npopulation in favor of ibrutinib versus chlorambucil. In patients with baseline cytopenias, sustained \nhaematologic improvement was: platelets 77.1% versus 42.9%; haemoglobin 84.3% versus 45.5% for \nibrutinib and chlorambucil respectively.\n\nTable 4: Efficacy results in Study PCYC-1115-CA\nEndpoint IMBRUVICA\n\nN=136\nChlorambucil\n\nN=133\nPFSa\n\nNumber of events (%) 15 (11.0) 64 (48.1)\nMedian (95% CI), months Not reached 18.9 (14.1, 22.0)\nHR (95% CI) 0.161 (0.091, 0.283)\nORRa (CR+PR) 82.4% 35.3%\nP-value <0.0001\nOSb\n\nNumber of deaths (%) 3 (2.2) 17 (12.8)\nHR (95% CI) 0.163 (0.048, 0.558)\nCI=confidence interval; HR=hazard ratio; CR=complete response; ORR=overall response rate; OS=overall survival; \nPFS=progression-free survival; PR=partial response\na IRC evaluated, median follow-up 18.4 months.\nb Median OS not reached for both arms. p<0.005 for OS\n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1115-CA\n\n\n\n43\n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier curve of OS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1115-CA\n\n48-month follow-up\nWith a median follow-up time on study of 48 months in Study PCYC-1115-CA and its extension \nstudy, an 86% reduction in the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was observed \nfor patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. The median investigator-assessed PFS was not reached in the \nIMBRUVICA arm and was 15 months [95% CI (10.22, 19.35)] in the chlorambucil arm; (HR=0.14 \n[95% CI (0.09, 0.21)]). The 4-year PFS estimate was 73.9% in the IMBRUVICA arm and 15.5% in \nthe chlorambucil arm, respectively. The updated Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 4. \nThe investigator-assessed ORR was 91.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm versus 36.8% in the chlorambucil \narm. The CR rate according to IWCLL criteria was 16.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm versus 3.0% in the \nchlorambucil arm. At the time of long-term follow-up, a total of 73 subjects (54.9%) originally \nrandomised to the chlorambucil arm subsequently received ibrutinib as cross-over treatment. The \nKaplan-Meier landmark estimate for OS at 48-months was 85.5% in the IMBRUVICA arm.\n\nThe treatment effect of ibrutinib in Study PCYC-1115-CA was consistent across high-risk patients \nwith del17p/TP53 mutation, del11q, and/or unmutated IGHV.\n\n\n\n44\n\nFigure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1115-CA with 48 \nMonths Follow-up\n\nCombination therapy\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with treatment naïve CLL/SLL were further \nevaluated in a randomised, multi-center, open-label, phase 3 study (PCYC-1130-CA) of IMBRUVICA \nin combination with obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. The study \nenrolled patients who were 65 years of age or older or <65 years of age with coexisting medical \nconditions, reduced renal function as measured by creatinine clearance <70 mL/min, or presence of \ndel17p/TP53 mutation. Patients (n=229) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg \ndaily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or chlorambucil at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg on \nDays 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. In both arms, patients received 1000 mg of \nobinutuzumab on Days 1, 8 and 15 of the first cycle, followed by treatment on the first day of \n5 subsequent cycles (total of 6 cycles, 28 days each). The first dose of obinutuzumab was divided \nbetween day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg). \n\nThe median age was 71 years (range, 40 to 87 years), 64% were male, and 96% were Caucasian. All \npatients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (48%) or 1-2 (52%). At baseline, 52% had \nadvanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 32% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 44% with \nbaseline anaemia, 22% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 28% had a CrCL <60 mL/min, and the \nmedian Cumulative Illness Rating Score for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) was 4 (range, 0 to 12).

The ORR including PR with lymphocytosis was 70.6%. \nMedian time to response was 1.9 months. The DOR ranged from 3.9 to 24.2+ months. The median \nDOR was not reached.\n\nA randomised, multi-center, open-label phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA versus ofatumumab \n(PCYC-1112-CA) was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Patients (n=391) were \nrandomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable \ntoxicity, or ofatumumab for up to 12 doses (300/2,000 mg). Fifty-seven patients randomised to \nofatumumab crossed over following progression to receive IMBRUVICA. The median age was \n67 years (range: 30 to 88 years), 68% were male, and 90% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline \nECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 91 months and the median \nnumber of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 13 treatments). At baseline, 58% of patients had at least \none tumour ≥5 cm. Thirty-two percent of patients had deletion 17p (with 50% of patients having \ndeletion 17p/TP53 mutation), 24% had 11q deletion, and 47% of patients had unmutated IGHV.\n\nProgression free survival (PFS) as assessed by an IRC according to IWCLL criteria indicated a 78% \nstatistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression for patients in the IMBRUVICA \n\n\n\n47\n\narm. Analysis of OS demonstrated a 57% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death for \npatients in the IMBRUVICA arm.

The median investigator-assessed PFS according to IWCLL criteria was \n44.1 months [95% CI (38.47, 56.18)] in the IMBRUVICA arm and 8.1 months [95% CI (7.79, 8.25)] \nin the ofatumumab arm, respectively; HR=0.15 [95% CI (0.11, 0.20)]. The updated Kaplan-Meier \ncurve for PFS is shown in Figure 7. The investigator-assessed ORR in the IMBRUVICA arm was \n87.7% versus 22.4% in the ofatumumab arm. At the time of final analysis, 133 (67.9%) of the \n196 subjects originally randomised to the ofatumumab treatment arm had crossed over to ibrutinib \ntreatment. The median investigator-assessed PFS2 (time from randomisation until PFS event after first \nsubsequent anti-neoplastic therapy) according to IWCLL criteria was 65.4 months [95% CI (51.61, not \nestimable)] in the IMBRUVICA arm and 38.5 months [95% CI (19.98, 47.24)] in the ofatumumab \narm, respectively; HR=0.54 [95% CI (0.41, 0.71)]. The median OS was 67.7 months [95% CI (61.0, \nnot estimable)] in the IMBRUVICA arm.\n\nThe treatment effect of ibrutinib in Study PCYC-1112-CA was consistent across high-risk patients \nwith deletion 17p/TP53 mutation, deletion 11q, and/or unmutated IGHV.\n\n\n\n49\n\nFigure 7: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1112-CA at Final \nAnalysis with 65 months Follow-up\n\nCombination therapy\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients previously treated for CLL were further evaluated \nin a randomised, multicenter, double-blinded phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA in combination with BR \nversus placebo+BR (Study CLL3001). Patients (n=578) were randomised 1:1 to receive either \nIMBRUVICA 420 mg daily or placebo in combination with BR until disease progression, or \nunacceptable toxicity. All patients received BR for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Bendamustine \nwas dosed at 70 mg/m2 infused IV over 30 minutes on Cycle 1, Days 2 and 3, and on Cycles 2-6, \nDays 1 and 2 for up to 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 in the first cycle, \nDay 1, and 500 mg/m2 Cycles 2 through 6, Day 1. Ninety patients randomised to placebo+BR crossed \nover to receive IMBRUVICA following IRC confirmed progression. The median age was 64 years \n(range, 31 to 86 years), 66% were male, and 91% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline ECOG \nperformance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 6 years and the median number of \nprior treatments was 2 (range, 1 to 11 treatments). At baseline, 56% of patients had at least one tumour \n≥5 cm, 26% had del11q.\n\nProgression free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to IWCLL criteria. Efficacy results for \nStudy CLL3001 are shown in Table 9.\n\nTable 9: Efficacy Results in patients with CLL (Study CLL3001) \n\nEndpoint\nIMBRUVICA+BR\n\nN=289\nPlacebo+BR\n\nN=289\nPFSa\n\nMedian (95% CI), months\nNot reached 13.3 (11.3, 13.9)\n\nHR=0.203 [95% CI: 0.150, 0.276]\nORRb % 82.7 67.8\nOSc HR=0.628 [95% CI: 0.385, 1.024]\nCI=confidence interval; HR=hazard ratio; ORR=overall response rate; OS=overall survival; PFS=progression-free \nsurvival\na IRC evaluated.\nb IRC evaluated, ORR (complete response, complete response with incomplete marrow recovery, nodular partial \n\nresponse, partial response).\nc Median OS not reached for both arms.\n\n\n\n50\n\nWM\nSingle agent\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in WM (IgM-excreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) were \nevaluated in an open-label, multi-center, single-arm trial of 63 previously treated patients. The median \nage was 63 years (range: 44 to 86 years), 76% were male, and 95% were Caucasian. All patients had a \nbaseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 74 months, and the \nmedian number of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 11 treatments). At baseline, the median serum \nIgM value was 3.5 g/dL, and 60% of patients were anaemic (haemoglobin ≤11 g/dL or 6.8 mmol/L).\n\nIMBRUVICA was administered orally at 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable \ntoxicity. The primary endpoint in this study was ORR per investigator assessment. The ORR and DOR \nwere assessed using criteria adopted from the Third International Workshop of WM. Responses to \nIMBRUVICA are shown in Table 10.\n\nTable 10: ORR and DOR in patients with WM\nTotal (N=63)\n\nORR (%) 87.3\n95% CI (%) (76.5, 94.4)\nVGPR (%) 14.3\nPR (%) 55.6\nMR (%) 17.5\nMedian DOR months (range) NR (0.03+, 18.8+)\nCI=confidence interval; DOR=duration of response; NR=not reached; MR=minor response; PR=partial response; \nVGPR=very good partial response; ORR=MR+PR+VGPR\nMedian follow-up time on study=14.8 months\n\nThe median time to response was 1.0 month (range: 0.7-13.4 months).\nEfficacy results were also assessed by an IRC demonstrating an ORR of 83%, with a 11% VGPR rate \nand a 51% PR rate.\n\nCombination therapy\nThe safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in WM were further evaluated in patients with treatment-\nnaïve or previously treated WM in a randomised, multicenter, double-blinded phase 3 study of \nIMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab versus placebo in combination with rituximab \n(PCYC-1127-CA). Patients (n=150) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg \ndaily or placebo in combination with rituximab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nRituximab was administered weekly at a dose of 375 mg/m2 for 4 consecutive weeks (weeks 1-4) \nfollowed by a second course of weekly rituximab for 4 consecutive weeks (weeks 17-20).\n\nThe median age was 69 years (range, 36 to 89 years), 66% were male, and 79% were Caucasian. \nNinety-three percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and 7% of patients \nhad a baseline ECOG performance status of 2. Forty-five percent of patients were treatment-naïve, and \n55% of patients were previously treated. The median time since diagnosis was 52.6 months (treatment-\nnaïve patients=6.5 months and previously treated patients=94.3 months). Among previously treated \npatients, the median number of prior treatments was 2 (range, 1 to 6 treatments). At baseline, the \nmedian serum IgM value was 3.2 g/dL (range, 0.6 to 8.3 g/dL), 63% of patients were anaemic \n(haemoglobin ≤11 g/dL or 6.8 mmol/L) and MYD88 L265P mutations were present in 77% of \npatients, absent in 13% of patients, and 9% of patients were not evaluable for mutation status.\n\nProgression free survival (PFS) as assessed by IRC indicated an 80% statistically significant reduction \nin the risk of death or progression in the IMBRUVICA arm. Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1127-\nCA are shown in Table 11 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 8. PFS hazard \nratios for treatment-naïve patients, previously treated patients, and patients with or without MYD88 \nL265P mutations were consistent with the PFS hazard ratio for the ITT population.\n\n\n\n51\n\nTable 11: Efficacy results in Study PCYC-1127-CA\n\nEndpoint\nIMBRUVICA+R\n\nN=75\nPlacebo+R\n\nN=75\nProgression Free Survivala\n\nNumber of events (%) 14 (18.7) 42 (56.0)\nMedian (95% CI), months Not reached 20.3 (13.7, 27.6)\nHR (95% CI) 0.20 (0.11, 0.38)\nTTnT\nMedian (95% CI), months Not reached 18.1 (11.1, NE)\nHR (95% CI) 0.1 (0.04, 0.23)\nBest Overall Response (%)\nCR 2.7 1.3\nVGPR 22.7 4.0\nPR 46.7 26.7\nMR 20.0 14.7\nOverall Response Rate (CR, \nVGPR, PR, MR)b (%)\n\n92.0 46.7\n\nMedian duration of overall \nresponse, months (range)\n\nNot reached (1.9+, 36.4+) 24.8 (1.9, 30.3+)\n\nResponse Rate (CR, VGPR, PR)b\n\n(%)\n72.0 32.0\n\nMedian duration of response, \nmonths (range)\n\nNot reached (1.9+, 36.4+) 21.2 (4.6, 25.8)\n\nRate of Sustained Haemoglobin \nImprovementb, c (%)\n\n73.3 41.3\n\nCI=confidence interval; CR=complete response; HR=hazard ratio; MR=minor response; NE=not estimable; \nPR=partial response; R=Rituximab; TTnT=time to next treatment; VGPR=very good partial response\na IRC evaluated.\nb p-value associated with response rate was <0.0001.\nc Defined as increase of ≥2 g/dL over baseline regardless of baseline value, or an increase to >11 g/dL with \n\na ≥0.5 g/dL improvement if baseline was ≤11 g/dL.\nMedian follow-up time on study=26.5 months.\n\n\n\n52\n\nFigure 8: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1127-CA\n\nGrade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions were observed in 1% of patients treated with \nIMBRUVICA+rituximab and 16% of patients treated with placebo+rituximab.\n\nTumor flare in the form of IgM increase occurred in 8.0% of subjects in the IMBRUVICA+rituximab \narm and 46.7% of subjects in the placebo+rituximab arm.\n\nStudy PCYC-1127-CA had a separate monotherapy arm of 31 patients with previously treated WM \nwho failed prior rituximab-containing therapy and received single agent IMBRUVICA. The median \nage was 67 years (range, 47 to 90 years). Eighty-one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG \nperformance status of 0 or 1, and 19% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2. The median \nnumber of prior treatments was 4 (range, 1 to 7 treatments). The response rate per IRC observed in the \nmonotherapy arm was 71% (0% CR, 29% VGPR, 42% PR). The overall response rate per IRC \nobserved in the monotherapy arm was 87% (0% CR, 29% VGPR, 42% PR, 16% MR). With a median \nfollow-up time on study of 34 months (range, 8.6+ to 37.7 months), the median duration of response \nhas not been reached.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIMBRUVICA in all subsets of the paediatric population in MCL, CLL and lymphoplasmacytic \nlymphoma (LPL) (for information on paediatric use, see section 4.2).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nIbrutinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a median Tmax of 1 to 2 hours. Absolute \nbioavailability in fasted condition (n=8) was 2.9% (90% CI=2.1 – 3.9) and doubled when combined \nwith a meal. Pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib does not significantly differ in patients with different B-cell \nmalignancies. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The steady state AUC observed \nin patients at 560 mg is (mean ± standard deviation) 953 ± 705 ng h/mL. Administration of ibrutinib in \nfasted condition resulted in approximately 60% of exposure (AUClast) as compared to either \n30 minutes before, 30 minutes after (fed condition) or 2 hours after a high fat breakfast.\n\n\n\n53\n\nIbrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. In fasted healthy subjects \nadministered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at 40 mg once daily for 5 days, \ncompared to ibrutinib alone, geometric mean ratios (90% CI) were 83% (68-102%), 92% (78-110%), \nand 38% (26-53%) for AUC0-24, AUClast, and Cmax, respectively.\n\nDistribution\nReversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97.3% with no concentration \ndependence in the range of 50 to 1,000 ng/mL. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state \n(Vd, ss/F) was approximately 10,000 L.\n\nMetabolism\nIbrutinib is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 to produce a dihydrodiol metabolite with an inhibitory \nactivity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than that of ibrutinib. Involvement of CYP2D6 in \nthe metabolism of ibrutinib appears to be minimal.\n\nTherefore, no precautions are necessary in patients with different CYP2D6 genotypes.\n\nElimination\nApparent clearance (CL/F) is approximately 1,000 L/h. The half-life of ibrutinib is 4 to 13 hours.\nAfter a single oral administration of radiolabeled [14C]-ibrutinib in healthy subjects, approximately \n90% of radioactivity was excreted within 168 hours, with the majority (80%) excreted in the faeces \nand <10% accounted for in urine. Unchanged ibrutinib accounted for approximately 1% of the \nradiolabeled excretion product in faeces and none in urine.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicated that age does not significantly influence ibrutinib clearance \nfrom the circulation.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo pharmacokinetic studies were performed with IMBRUVICA in patients under 18 years of age.\n\nGender\nPopulation pharmacokinetics data indicated that gender does not significantly influence ibrutinib \nclearance from the circulation.\n\nRace\nThere are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics.\n\nBody weight\nPopulation pharmacokinetics data indicated that body weight (range: 41-146 kg; mean [SD]: \n83 [19 kg]) had a negligible effect on ibrutinib clearance.\n\nRenal impairment\nIbrutinib has minimal renal clearance; urinary excretion of metabolites is <10% of the dose. No \nspecific studies have been conducted to date in subjects with impaired renal function. There are no \ndata in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nIbrutinib is metabolised in the liver. A hepatic impairment trial was performed in non-cancer subjects \nadministered a single dose of 140 mg of medicinal product under fasting conditions. The effect of \nimpaired liver function varied substantially between individuals, but on average a 2.7-, 8.2-, and \n9.8-fold increase in ibrutinib exposure (AUClast) was observed in subjects with mild (n=6, Child-Pugh \nclass A), moderate (n=10, Child-Pugh class B) and severe (n=8, Child-Pugh class C) hepatic \nimpairment, respectively. The free fraction of ibrutinib also increased with degree of impairment, with \n3.0, 3.8 and 4.8% in subjects with mild, moderate and severe liver impairment, respectively, compared \n\n\n\n54\n\nto 3.3% in plasma from matched healthy controls within this study. The corresponding increase in \nunbound ibrutinib exposure (AUCunbound, last) is estimated to be 4.1-, 9.8-, and 13-fold in subjects with \nmild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively (see section 4.2).\n\nCo-administration with transport substrates/inhibitors\nIn vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-gp, nor other major transporters, except \nOCT2. The dihydrodiol metabolite and other metabolites are P-gp substrates. Ibrutinib is an in vitro\ninhibitor of P-gp and BCRP (see section 4.5).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe following adverse effects were seen in studies of 13-weeks duration in rats and dogs. Ibrutinib \nwas found to induce gastrointestinal effects (soft faeces/diarrhoea and/or inflammation) and lymphoid \ndepletion in rats and dogs with a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day in \nboth species. Based on mean exposure (AUC) at the 560 mg/day clinical dose, AUC ratios were \n2.6 and 21 at the NOAEL in male and female rats, and 0.4 and 1.8 at the NOAEL in male and female \ndogs, respectively. Lowest Observed Effect Level (LOEL) (60 mg/kg/day) margins in the dog are \n3.6-fold (males) and 2.3-fold (females). In rats, moderate pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (considered \nadverse) was observed at doses of ≥100 mg/kg in male rats (AUC exposure margin of 2.6-fold) and \nnot observed in females at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 21.3-fold). Mildly \ndecreased trabecular and cortical bone was seen in female rats administered ≥100 mg/kg/day (AUC \nexposure margin of 20.3-fold). All gastrointestinal, lymphoid and bone findings recovered following \nrecovery periods of 6-13 weeks. Pancreatic findings partially recovered during comparable reversal \nperiods.\n\nJuvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted.\n\nCarcinogenicity/genotoxicity\nIbrutinib was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse at oral doses up \nto 2000 mg/kg/day with an exposure margin of approximately 23 (males) to 37 (females) times the \nhuman AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily.\nIbrutinib has no genotoxic properties when tested in bacteria, mammalian cells or in mice.\n\nReproductive toxicity\nIn pregnant rats, ibrutinib at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day was associated with increased post-implantation \nloss and increased visceral (heart and major vessels) malformations and skeletal variations with an \nexposure margin 14 times the AUC found in patients at a daily dose of 560 mg. At a dose of \n≥40 mg/kg/day, ibrutinib was associated with decreased foetal weights (AUC ratio of ≥5.6 as \ncompared to daily dose of 560 mg in patients). Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 1.3 times the AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily) (see section 4.6).\n\nIn pregnant rabbits, ibrutinib at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day or greater was associated with skeletal \nmalformations (fused sternebrae) and ibrutinib at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day was associated with \nincreased post-implantation loss. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rabbits at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 2.0 times the exposure (AUC) in patients with MCL administered ibrutinib 560 mg \ndaily and 2.8 times the exposure in patients with CLL or WM receiving ibrutinib dose 420 mg per \nday). Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the AUC of \nibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily) (see section 4.6).\n\nFertility\nNo effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the \nmaximum dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (HED 16 mg/kg/day).\n\n\n\n55\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n98\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nIMBRUVICA 140 mg hard capsules\nibrutinib\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What IMBRUVICA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take IMBRUVICA\n3. How to take IMBRUVICA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store IMBRUVICA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What IMBRUVICA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat IMBRUVICA is\nIMBRUVICA is an anticancer medicine that contains the active substance ibrutinib. It belongs to a \nclass of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors.\n\nWhat IMBRUVICA is used for\nIt is used to treat the following blood cancers in adults:\n Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a type of cancer affecting the lymph nodes, when the disease has \n\ncome back or has not responded to treatment.\n Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called \n\nlymphocytes that also involves the lymph nodes. IMBRUVICA is used in patients who have not \npreviously been treated for CLL or when the disease has come back or has not responded to \ntreatment.\n\n Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called \nlymphocytes. It is used in patients who have not previously been treated for WM or when the \ndisease has come back or has not responded to treatment or in patients for whom chemotherapy\ngiven together with an antibody is not a suitable therapy.\n\nHow IMBRUVICA works\nIn MCL, CLL and WM, IMBRUVICA works by blocking Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a protein in the \nbody that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking this protein, IMBRUVICA helps kill \nand reduce the number of cancer cells. It also slows down the worsening of the cancer.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take IMBRUVICA\n\nDo not take IMBRUVICA\n if you are allergic to ibrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6)\n if you are taking a herbal medicine called St. John’s Wort, used for depression. If you are not \n\nsure about this, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine.\n\n\n\n99\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IMBRUVICA:\n if you have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements that \n\nincrease your risk of bleeding (see section “Other medicines and IMBRUVICA”)\n if you have irregular heart beat or have a history of irregular heart beat or severe heart failure, or \n\nif you feel any of the following: shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, light-headedness, \nfainting or near fainting, chest pain or swollen legs\n\n if you have liver or kidney problems\n if you have high blood pressure\n if you have recently had any surgery, especially if this might affect how you absorb food or \n\nmedicines from your stomach or gut\n if you are planning to have any surgery– your doctor may ask you to stop taking IMBRUVICA\n\nfor a short time (3 to 7 days) before and after your surgery.\n if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because IMBRUVICA \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal. Patients will be carefully \nchecked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nWhen taking IMBRUVICA, tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: \nmemory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare but \nserious brain infection which can be fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML).\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: sudden numbness or weakness \nin the limbs (especially on one side of the body), sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding \nspeech, sight loss, difficulty walking, loss of balance or lack of coordination, sudden severe headache \nwith no known cause. These may be signs and symptoms of stroke.\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you develop left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib \ncage or at the tip of your left shoulder (these may be symptoms of rupture of the spleen) after you stop \ntaking IMBRUVICA.\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice breathlessness, difficulty breathing when lying down, \nswelling of the feet, ankles or legs and weakness/tiredness (these may be signs of heart failure) during \ntreatment with IMBRUVICA.\n\nHaemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\nThere have been rare reports of excessive activation of white blood cells associated with inflammation \n(haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. If you \nexperience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, bruising, or skin rash, contact your \ndoctor immediately.\n\nTests and check-ups before and during treatment\nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS): Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast breakdown \nof cancer cells have happened during treatment of cancer and sometimes even without treatment. This \nmay lead to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor or another\nhealthcare provider may do blood tests to check for TLS.\n\nLymphocytosis: Laboratory tests may show an increase in white blood cells (called “lymphocytes”) in \nyour blood in the first few weeks of treatment. This is expected and may last for a few months. This \ndoes not necessarily mean that your blood cancer is getting worse. Your doctor will check your blood \ncounts before or during the treatment and in rare cases they may need to give you another medicine. \nTalk to your doctor about what your test results mean.\n\n\n\n100\n\nChildren and adolescents\nIMBRUVICA should not be used in children and adolescents.

It is used in patients who have not previously been treated for WM or when the \ndisease has come back or has not responded to treatment or in patients for whom chemotherapy\ngiven together with an antibody is not a suitable therapy.\n\nHow IMBRUVICA works\nIn MCL, CLL and WM, IMBRUVICA works by blocking Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a protein in the \nbody that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking this protein, IMBRUVICA helps kill \nand reduce the number of cancer cells. It also slows down the worsening of the cancer.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take IMBRUVICA\n\nDo not take IMBRUVICA\n if you are allergic to ibrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6)\n\n\n\n107\n\n if you are taking a herbal medicine called St. John’s Wort, used for depression. If you are not \nsure about this, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IMBRUVICA:\n if you have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements that \n\nincrease your risk of bleeding (see section “Other medicines and IMBRUVICA”)\n if you have irregular heart beat or have a history of irregular heart beat or severe heart failure, or \n\nif you feel any of the following: shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, light-headedness, \nfainting or near fainting, chest pain or swollen legs\n\n if you have liver or kidney problems\n if you have high blood pressure\n if you have recently had any surgery, especially if this might affect how you absorb food or \n\nmedicines from your stomach or gut\n if you are planning to have any surgery– your doctor may ask you to stop taking IMBRUVICA \n\nfor a short time (3 to 7 days) before and after your surgery.\n if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because IMBRUVICA \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal. Patients will be carefully \nchecked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nWhen taking IMBRUVICA, tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: \nmemory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare but \nserious brain infection which can be fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML).\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: sudden numbness or weakness \nin the limbs (especially on one side of the body), sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding \nspeech, sight loss, difficulty walking, loss of balance or lack of coordination, sudden severe headache \nwith no known cause. These may be signs and symptoms of stroke.\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you develop left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib \ncage or at the tip of your left shoulder (these may be symptoms of rupture of the spleen) after you stop \ntaking IMBRUVICA.\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice breathlessness, difficulty breathing when lying down, \nswelling of the feet, ankles or legs and weakness/tiredness (these may be signs of heart failure) during \ntreatment with IMBRUVICA.\n\nHaemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\nThere have been rare reports of excessive activation of white blood cells associated with inflammation \n(haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. If you \nexperience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, bruising, or skin rash, contact your \ndoctor immediately.\n\nTests and check-ups before and during treatment\nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS): Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast breakdown \nof cancer cells have happened during treatment of cancer and sometimes even without treatment. This \nmay lead to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor or another\nhealthcare provider may do blood tests to check for TLS.\n\nLymphocytosis: Laboratory tests may show an increase in white blood cells (called “lymphocytes”) in \nyour blood in the first few weeks of treatment. This is expected and may last for a few months. This \ndoes not necessarily mean that your blood cancer is getting worse. Your doctor will check your blood \ncounts before or during the treatment and in rare cases they may need to give you another medicine. \nTalk to your doctor about what your test results mean.\n\n\n\n108\n\nChildren and adolescents\nIMBRUVICA should not be used in children and adolescents. This is because it has not been studied \nin these age groups.\n\nOther medicines and IMBRUVICA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, herbal medicines and \nsupplements. This is because IMBRUVICA may affect the way some other medicines work. Also \nsome other medicines can affect the way IMBRUVICA works.\n\nIMBRUVICA may make you bleed more easily. This means you should tell your doctor if you take \nother medicines that increase your risk of bleeding. This includes:\n acetyl salicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or \n\nnaproxen\n blood thinners such as warfarin, heparin or other medicines for blood clots\n supplements that may increase your risk of bleeding such as fish oil, vitamin E or flaxseed.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking IMBRUVICA.\n\nAlso tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines – The effects of IMBRUVICA or \nother medicines may be influenced if you take IMBRUVICA together with any of the following\nmedicines:\n medicines called antibiotics to treat bacterial infections – clarithromycin, telithromycin, \n\nciprofloxacin, erythromycin or rifampicin\n medicines for fungal infections – posaconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole or \n\nvoriconazole\n medicines for HIV infection – ritonavir, cobicistat, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, \n\natazanavir, or fosamprenavir\n medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy - aprepitant\n medicines for depression - nefazodon\n medicines called kinase inhibitors for treatment of other cancers – crizotinib or imatinib\n medicines called calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure or chest pain – diltiazem or\n\nverapamil\n medicines called statins to treat high cholesterol - rosuvastatin\n heart medicines/anti-arrhythmics – amiodarone or dronedarone\n medicines to prevent seizures or to treat epilepsy, or medicines to treat a painful condition of the \n\nface called trigeminal neuralgia – carbamazepine or phenytoin.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking IMBRUVICA.\n\nIf you are taking digoxin, a medicine used for heart problems, or methotrexate, a medicine used to \ntreat other cancers and to reduce the activity of the immune system (e.g., for rheumatoid arthritis or \npsoriasis), it should be taken at least 6 hours before or after IMBRUVICA.\n\nIMBRUVICA with food\nDo not take IMBRUVICA with grapefruit or Seville oranges (bitter oranges) – this includes \neating them, drinking the juice or taking a supplement that might contain them. This is because it can \nincrease the amount of IMBRUVICA in your blood.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not get pregnant while you are taking this medicine. IMBRUVICA should not be used during \npregnancy. There is no information about the safety of IMBRUVICA in pregnant women.\n\n\n\n109\n\nWomen of childbearing age must use a highly effective method of birth control during and up to three \nmonths after receiving IMBRUVICA, to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with \nIMBRUVICA. \n\n Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant.\n Do not breast-feed while you are taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou may feel tired or dizzy after taking IMBRUVICA, which may affect your ability to drive or use \nany tools or machines.\n\nIMBRUVICA contains lactose\nIMBRUVICA contains lactose (a type of sugar).

The PRAC concluded that the product information of ibrutinib should be \namended accordingly. \n\nBased on plausible mechanism of action, the absence of neutrophilic dermatoses events with the \ncomparator in the RCT and 7 cases identified from the MAH’s global safety database with positive \ndechallenge including one also with positive rechallenge; of which 4 were biopsy confirmed and had \nno alternate explanation for the events, a causal relationship between ibrutinib and the events of \nneutrophilic dermatosis, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis and pyoderma gangrenosum is a \nreasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of ibrutinib should be \namended in order to add these 3 events under the grouped term, neutrophilic dermatoses, as a new \nADR in the product information.  \n\nTwenty five cases were identified in MAH’s safety database coded to PTs Haemophagocytic \nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or Macrophage activation, of which 2 cases were identified as cases of \ninterest in which patients had classic symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with HLH and had \nfatal outcome, one report of HLH of clinical trial database in ibrutinib pool and publication in \nscientific literature in which a plausible biological mechanism is proposed. Considering the \nseriousness of this condition with often fatal outcome, there is a need to warn clinicians and patients. \nThe PRAC concluded that the product information of product ibrutinib should be amended \naccordingly.\n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.\n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)\n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for ibrutinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk \nbalance of the medicinal product containing ibrutinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to \nthe product information.\n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
