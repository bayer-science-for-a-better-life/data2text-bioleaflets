This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLIFMIOR 25 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 25 mg of etanercept. \n \nEtanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant \nDNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a \ndimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain \nof human tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc \ncomponent contains the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH1 region of IgG1. Etanercept \ncontains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The \nspecific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 106 units/mg. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection (powder for injection). \n \nThe powder is white. The solvent is a clear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nLIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including \nmethotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. \n \nLIFMIOR can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nLIFMIOR is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in \nadults not previously treated with methotrexate. \n \nLIFMIOR, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of \nprogression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \nTreatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \nchildren and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have \nproved intolerant of, methotrexate.  \n \nTreatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate \nresponse to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nTreatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an \ninadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. \n \nLIFMIOR has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nTreatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. LIFMIOR has been shown to \nimprove physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of \nperipheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of \nthe disease. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \nTreatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to \nconventional therapy. \n \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nTreatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of \ninflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs). \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nTreatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a \ncontraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or \npsoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nTreatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who \nare inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nLIFMIOR treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \nankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque \npsoriasis. Patients treated with LIFMIOR should be given the Patient Alert Card.  \n \nLIFMIOR is available in strengths of 10, 25 and 50 mg. \n\n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly is the recommended dose. Alternatively, 50 mg \nadministered once weekly has been shown to be safe and effective (see section 5.1). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nThe recommended dose is 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly, or 50 mg administered once \nweekly.  \n \nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not \nresponding within this time period. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nPlaque psoriasis \nThe recommended dose of LIFMIOR is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once \nweekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if \nnecessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with LIFMIOR should \ncontinue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks may be \nappropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in patients who \nshow no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the same guidance on \ntreatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once \nweekly.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18-64 years of \nage. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis  \nThe recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a \nsubcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of \n50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients \nwho show no response after 4 months. \n \nThe 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the \nweight of 25 kg. \n \nNo formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety \ndata from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar \nto that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg \nsubcutaneously (see section 5.1). \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 2 years in the indication \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) \nThe recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to \n24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. \n \nIf re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be \nfollowed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 6 years in the indication \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nMethod of administration \nLIFMIOR is administered by subcutaneous injection. LIFMIOR powder for solution must be \nreconstituted in 1 ml of solvent before use (see section 6.6). \n \nComprehensive instructions for the preparation and administration of the reconstituted LIFMIOR vial \nare given in the package leaflet, section 7, \"Instructions for preparation and giving an injection of \nLIFMIOR.\" \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSepsis or risk of sepsis. \n \nTreatment with LIFMIOR should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic \nor localised infections. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trademark and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nInfections \nPatients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with LIFMIOR, taking \ninto consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range \n7 to 300 hours). \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal \ninfections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). \nThese infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). \nIn some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting \nin delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the \npatient’s risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be \nconsidered.  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with LIFMIOR should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of LIFMIOR should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of LIFMIOR in patients with a history of \nrecurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to \ninfections, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. \n \nTuberculosis \nCases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary \nlocation, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. \n \nBefore starting treatment with LIFMIOR, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(‘latent’) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history \nof tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, \nshould be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient’s alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the \nrisk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, LIFMIOR therapy must not be initiated. If inactive (‘latent’) \ntuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis \ntherapy before the initiation of LIFMIOR, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this \nsituation, the benefit/risk balance of LIFMIOR therapy should be very carefully considered. \nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis \n(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after LIFMIOR \ntreatment. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) \nand had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, has been reported. This includes \nreports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with LIFMIOR. For patients \nwho test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering LIFMIOR in patients \npreviously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active \nHBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate \ndata from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, LIFMIOR should \nbe stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nWorsening of hepatitis C \nThere have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving LIFMIOR. LIFMIOR should \nbe used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nConcurrent administration of LIFMIOR and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of \nserious infections and neutropenia compared to LIFMIOR alone. This combination has not \ndemonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of LIFMIOR and anakinra is not \nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept  \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions associated with LIFMIOR administration have been reported commonly. Allergic \nreactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious \nallergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, LIFMIOR therapy should be discontinued immediately and \nappropriate therapy initiated. \n \nImmunosuppression \nThe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, to affect host defences against \ninfections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune \nresponses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with LIFMIOR, there was \nno evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector cell populations. \n \nTwo juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of \naseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella \nvirus should temporarily discontinue LIFMIOR therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment \nwith Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nSolid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers) \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8).  \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been \nobserved among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the \noccurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nreceiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported \nin patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and \nleukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates risk estimation. \n \nBased on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nhaematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nLIFMIOR, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically \nassociated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and \nadolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nSkin cancers \nMelanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with \nTNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been \nreported very infrequently in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Periodic skin examination is \nrecommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nCombining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients \nreceiving LIFMIOR compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis.  \n \nVaccinations \nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with LIFMIOR. No data are available on the \nsecondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving LIFMIOR. In a \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, \n184 patients also received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, \nmost psoriatic arthritis patients receiving LIFMIOR were able to mount effective B-cell immune \nresponse to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and \nfew patients had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving LIFMIOR. The clinical \nsignificance of this is unknown. \n \nAutoantibody formation \nTreatment with LIFMIOR may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). \n \nHaematologic reactions \nRare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated \nwith LIFMIOR who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers \nshould be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or \ninfections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on LIFMIOR, they \nshould seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full \nblood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, LIFMIOR should be discontinued. \n \nNeurological disorders \nThere have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with LIFMIOR (see \nsection 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies \n(including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have \nbeen performed evaluating LIFMIOR therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other \nTNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful \nrisk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nLIFMIOR to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are \nconsidered to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease. \n \nCombination therapy \nIn a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of \nLIFMIOR and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of \nLIFMIOR when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies \nof LIFMIOR and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are \nongoing. The long-term safety of LIFMIOR in combination with other disease-modifying \nantirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established. \n \nThe use of LIFMIOR in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment \nof psoriasis has not been studied. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal \nor hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. \n \nCongestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) \nPhysicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who have congestive heart failure \n(CHF). There have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking LIFMIOR. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of new \nonset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of \nthese patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of \nLIFMIOR in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not \nconclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those \npatients assigned to LIFMIOR treatment.  \n \nAlcoholic hepatitis \nIn a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with LIFMIOR or \nplacebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, LIFMIOR was not efficacious, and the mortality \nrate in patients treated with LIFMIOR was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, \nLIFMIOR should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use \ncaution when using LIFMIOR in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. \n \nWegener's granulomatosis \nA placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with LIFMIOR in addition to \nstandard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median \nduration of 25 months, has not shown LIFMIOR to be an effective treatment for Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly \nhigher in patients treated with LIFMIOR than in the control group. LIFMIOR is not recommended for \nthe treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis. \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes \nThere have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of LIFMIOR in patients receiving \nmedication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nIn the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall \ndifferences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older \nwho received LIFMIOR were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be \nexercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of \ninfections. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating LIFMIOR therapy (see \nVaccinations, above). \n \nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \nThere have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR (see section \n4.8).  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nAdult patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious \ninfection when compared with patients treated with either LIFMIOR or anakinra alone (historical \ndata). \n \nIn addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background \nmethotrexate, patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of \nserious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with LIFMIOR (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). The combination LIFMIOR and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is \ntherefore not recommended. \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept  \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4).  \n \nConcurrent treatment with sulfasalazine  \nIn a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which \nLIFMIOR was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant \ndecrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with LIFMIOR or \nsulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use \ncaution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. \n \nNon-interactions \nIn clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when LIFMIOR was administered with \nglucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nanalgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice. \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with \nmethotrexate, digoxin or warfarin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid \nbecoming pregnant during LIFMIOR therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. \n \nPregnancy  \nDevelopmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the \nfoetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been \ninvestigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in \none observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first \ntrimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds \nratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\ncommonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. \nNo change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In \nanother observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes \nin women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to \nnon-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds \nratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for \ncountry, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also \nshowed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year \nof life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. LIFMIOR should only be \nused during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nEtanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients \ntreated with LIFMIOR during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants \nmay be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the \nmother’s last dose of LIFMIOR is generally not recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \nEtanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In \nlactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected \nin the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be \nexcreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue LIFMIOR therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the \nbenefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nPreclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility \nand general reproductive performance are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, \nitching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, \nbronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, \nitching, and fever. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have also been reported for LIFMIOR. TNF-antagonists, such as LIFMIOR, \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defenses against infection and cancer. \nSerious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with LIFMIOR. Reports have included \nfatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use \nof LIFMIOR, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma). \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral \ndemyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with LIFMIOR use. There \nhave been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials in adults and on \npostmarketing experience. \n \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of \npatients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfection \n(including \nupper \nrespiratory \ntract \ninfection, \nbronchitis, \ncystitis, \nskin \ninfection)* \n\n Serious infections \n(including \npneumonia, \ncellulitis, arthritis \nbacterial, sepsis and \nparasitic infection)* \n \n\n \n\nTuberculosis, \nopportunistic \ninfection (including \ninvasive fungal, \nprotozoal, bacterial, \natypical \nmycobacterial, viral \ninfections, and \nLegionella)* \n\n Hepatitis B \nreactivation, \nlisteria \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps)  \n\n  Non-melanoma skin \ncancers* (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMalignant melanoma \n(see section 4.4), \nlymphoma, \nleukaemia  \n\n Merkel cell \ncarcinoma (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n  Thrombocytopenia, \nanaemia, \nleukopenia, \nneutropenia \n\n \n\nPancytopenia* Aplastic \nanaemia* \n\nHistiocytosis \nhaematophagic \n(macrophage \nactivation \nsyndrome)* \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Allergic \nreactions (see \nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders), \nautoantibody \nformation* \n\nVasculitis \n(including anti-\nneutrophilic \ncytoplasmic antibody \npositive vasculitis) \n\nSerious \nallergic/anaphylactic \nreactions (including \nangioedema, \nbronchospasm), \nsarcoidosis \n\n Worsening of \nsymptoms of \ndermatomyositis \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\n   CNS demyelinating \nevents suggestive of \nmultiple sclerosis or \nlocalised \ndemyelinating \nconditions, such as \noptic neuritis and \ntransverse myelitis \n(see section 4.4), \nperipheral \ndemyelinating events, \nincluding Guillain-\nBarré syndrome, \nchronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating \npolyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating \npolyneuropathy, and \nmultifocal motor \nneuropathy (see \nsection 4.4),  \nseizure \n\n  \n\nEye disorders    Uveitis, scleritis    \nCardiac \ndisorders  \n\n  Worsening of \ncardiac failure \ncongestive (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nNew onset cardiac \nfailure congestive \n(see section 4.4) \n\n  \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, and \nmediastinal \ndisorders  \n\n   Interstitial lung \ndisease (including \npneumonitis and \npulmonary fibrosis)* \n\n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders  \n\n  Elevated liver \nenzymes* \n\nAutoimmune \nhepatitis* \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders  \n\n Pruritus, rash Angioedema, \npsoriasis (including \nnew onset or \nworsening and \npustular, primarily \npalms and soles), \nurticaria, \npsoriasiform rash \n\nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, cutaneous \nvasculitis (including \nhypersensitivity \nvasculitis), erythema \nmultiforme, lichenoid \nreactions \n\nToxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders  \n\n   Cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus, \nsubacute cutaneous \nlupus erythematosus, \nlupus-like syndrome \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions  \n\nInjection \nsite \nreactions \n(including \nbleeding, \nbruising, \nerythema, \nitching, \npain, \nswelling)* \n\nPyrexia     \n\n*see Description of selected adverse reactions, below. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nOne hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in \n4,114 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with LIFMIOR for up to approximately \n6 years, including 231 patients treated with LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year \nactive-controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those \nexpected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of \napproximately 2 years duration involving 240 LIFMIOR-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical \nstudies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were \nreported in LIFMIOR-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with \nLIFMIOR in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and \n43 nonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. \n \nIn a group of 7,416 patients treated with LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \nankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. \n \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4). \n \nInjection site reactions \nCompared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with LIFMIOR had a significantly \nhigher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in \nthe first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the \nmajority of injection site reactions in the LIFMIOR treatment groups, and the majority of patients who \nwere given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. \nAdditionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at \nthe most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at \nprevious injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nIn controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with \nLIFMIOR developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during \nthe first 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nSerious infections \nIn placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or \nrequiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% \nof rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at \nvarious sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, \nendocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, \nosteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin \ninfection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year \nactive-controlled study where patients were treated with either LIFMIOR alone, methotrexate alone or \nLIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the \ntreatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of LIFMIOR with \nmethotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. \n \nThere were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with LIFMIOR and those \ntreated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. \nSerious infections experienced by LIFMIOR-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, \npneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic \nshock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient \nreported a serious infection (pneumonia). \n \nSerious and fatal infections have been reported during use of LIFMIOR; reported pathogens include \nbacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few \nweeks after initiating treatment with LIFMIOR in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., \ndiabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their \nrheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). LIFMIOR treatment may increase mortality in patients with \nestablished sepsis. \n \nOpportunistic infections have been reported in association with LIFMIOR, including invasive fungal, \nparasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and \nLegionella), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall \nincidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received LIFMIOR. The \nexposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, \napproximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive \nfungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, \nPneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma. Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half \nof the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports \nwith a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal \ninfections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \nAdult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid \narthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed \nnew positive ANA (≥1:40) was higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR (11%) than in placebo-\ntreated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded \nDNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with LIFMIOR \ncompared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated \nwith LIFMIOR compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with \nLIFMIOR who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-\ntreated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with LIFMIOR on the development of \nautoimmune diseases is unknown. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nThere have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have \ndeveloped other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are \ncompatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. \n \nPancytopenia and aplastic anaemia \nThere have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal \noutcomes (see section 4.4). \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \ninterstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept \nand methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% \n(frequency uncommon). There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including \npneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nIn studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with LIFMIOR plus anakinra, a higher \nrate of serious infections compared to LIFMIOR alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) \ndeveloped neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3). While neutropenic, one patient \ndeveloped cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElevated liver enzymes \nIn the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the \nfrequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving \netanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind \nperiods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and \nmethotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was \n4.18% (frequency common). \n \nAutoimmune hepatitis \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \nautoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept \nand methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% \n(frequency uncommon).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in \nfrequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special \nconsiderations are discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nThe types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years \nwere generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric \npopulations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic \nmeningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, \ndepression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic \nshock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. \n \nIn one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children \nexperienced an infection while receiving LIFMIOR during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), \nand the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-\nlabel extension therapy.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The \nhighest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m2 followed by \nsubcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient \nmistakenly self-administered 62 mg LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without \nexperiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to LIFMIOR. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB01 \n \nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid \narthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with \npsoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque \npsoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in \npsoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of \nTNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and \nlymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the \n55-kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs \nexist naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF \nbiological activity. \n \nTNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on \ncross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher \naffinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of \nTNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion \nelement in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nMechanism of action \nMuch of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in \nplaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by \nTNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF \nbinding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF \nbiologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional \ndownstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or \nregulated by TNF. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThis section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, \none study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study \nin adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, \nthree studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nAdult patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The \nstudy evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least \none but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or \n25 mg LIFMIOR or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive \nmonths. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid \narthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.  \n \nACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR at 3 and 6 months than in \npatients treated with placebo (ACR 20: LIFMIOR 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and \n6 months, respectively: ACR 50: LIFMIOR 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, \nrespectively; p<0.01 LIFMIOR vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses).  \n \nApproximately 15% of subjects who received LIFMIOR achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and \nmonth 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving \nLIFMIOR, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and \nnearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate \nbetween placebo and 25 mg. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all components of the \nACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the \nACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which \nincluded disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status \nsubdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were \nimproved in patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to controls at 3 and 6 months.  \n \nAfter discontinuation of LIFMIOR, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. \nRe-introduction of treatment with LIFMIOR after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the \nsame magnitudes of responses as patients who received LIFMIOR without interruption of therapy \nbased on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years \nin open-label extension treatment trials when patients received LIFMIOR without interruption.  \n \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study \nwith blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active \nrheumatoid arthritis (<3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of \n10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 24 months. \nMethotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first \n8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset of \naction within 2 weeks with LIFMIOR 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was \nmaintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean \nHAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with LIFMIOR 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at \n12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was \nmaintained in Year 2 of this study. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nIn this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total \nSharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. \nRadiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg \nLIFMIOR dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. LIFMIOR \n25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The \ndifferences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and LIFMIOR \n25 mg.

In this \nstudy, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly and \n153 patients received 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two \nLIFMIOR treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of \nRA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. \n \nAdult patients with psoriatic arthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active \npsoriatic arthritis (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: \n(1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules \nand presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or \n(5) spondylitis-like ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm \nin diameter. Patients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and \ncorticosteroids (24%). Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for ≥ 2 months) could \ncontinue at a stable dose of ≤ 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on \ndose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a \nweek for 6 months. At the end of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label \nextension study for a total duration of up to 2 years. \n \nClinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 \nresponse and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC).

Patients who “failed to \nrespond to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI<50 or PGA less than \ngood), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a \nsufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as \navailable. \n \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis \n(responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing \nLIFMIOR with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed \nin four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four \nstudies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least \na 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. \n \nStudy 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving ≥ \n10% of the body surface area who were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were \nrandomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for \n24 weeks. \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study \n1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. \nLIFMIOR was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a \nweek for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, \npatients received placebo or one of the above three LIFMIOR doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, \npatients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded LIFMIOR (25 mg twice a week); patients \nin the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally \nrandomised. \n \nStudy 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study \nreceived a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg LIFMIOR, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all \npatients received open-label 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. \n \nStudy 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this \nstudy received a dose of 50 mg LIFMIOR or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients \nreceived open-label 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. \n \nIn study 1, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI \n75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). At 24 weeks, \n56% of patients in the LIFMIOR-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of \nplacebo-treated patients.

Dermatologist Static Global Assessment. Clear or almost clear defined as 0 or 1 on a 0 to 5 scale. \n \nAmong patients with plaque psoriasis who received LIFMIOR, significant responses relative to \nplacebo were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of \ntherapy. \n \nStudy 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement \nof at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the \noccurrence of rebound (PASI ≥150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at \nleast half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, \nsymptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No \nrebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was \nsome evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with LIFMIOR in patients initially responding to \ntreatment. \n \nIn study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and \nhad their LIFMIOR dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 \nresponse through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the \nPASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. \n \nIn study 4, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 \n(38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once \nweekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI \n75 at week 24. \n \nIn long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where LIFMIOR was given without interruption, \nclinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. \n \nAn analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist \nclinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, \nthe choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and \nindividual patient needs. \n \nAntibodies to LIFMIOR \nAntibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. \nThese antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no \ncorrelation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nIn subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative \nrates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% \nof subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with \npsoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 4.8% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic \narthritis.  \n \nThe proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to \n3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of \nantibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis \nsubjects and psoriasis subjects. \n \nIn a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the \nincidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with \npolyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset \ntypes (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to \nseverely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, \nmethotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (< 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients \nreceived 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, \npatients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on LIFMIOR or receive placebo \nfor four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30 ), \ndefined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six \nJRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent \nglobal assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare \nwas defined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not \nmore than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. \n \nIn part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In \npart 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on LIFMIOR experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of \n26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was \n≥ 116 days for patients who received LIFMIOR and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of \npatients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the \npatients remaining on LIFMIOR continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those \nwho received placebo did not improve. \n \nIn an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of \n4 years at time of enrollment) continued to receive LIFMIOR for up to 10 years. Rates of serious \nadverse events and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. \n \nLong-term safety of LIFMIOR monotherapy (n=103), LIFMIOR plus methotrexate (n=294), or \nmethotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 \nto 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections \nwere more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 \nversus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature. \n \nIn another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to \n4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related \narthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated \nwith LIFMIOR at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for \n12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and \ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and \nphysician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nStudies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of \ncontinued LIFMIOR therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating LIFMIOR \ntherapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or \nreducing the recommended dose of LIFMIOR following its long-term use in patients with JIA. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an \nsPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of \nreceiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. \n \nPatients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At \nweek 12, more patients randomised to LIFMIOR had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than \nthose randomised to placebo. \n \n\nPaediatric Plaque Psoriasis Outcomes at 12 Weeks \n\n LIFMIOR \n0.8 mg/kg Once \n\nWeekly \n(N = 106) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 105) \n\nPASI 75, n (%) 60 (57%)a 12 (11%) \nPASI 50, n (%) 79 (75%)a 24 (23%) \n\nsPGA “clear” or “minimal”, n (%) 56 (53%)a 14 (13%) \nAbbreviation: sPGA-static Physician Global Assessment \na. p < 0.0001 compared with placebo \n\n \nAfter the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to \n50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were \nsimilar to those observed in the double-blind period. \n \nDuring a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo \nexperienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to \nLIFMIOR. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks.  \n \nThe long-term safety and effectiveness of LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was \nassessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to \n2 years beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with LIFMIOR was \ngenerally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEtanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) \nmethod, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products, as well as the parent compound. \n \nAbsorption \nEtanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum \nconcentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With \ntwice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high \nas those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg LIFMIOR, the average \nmaximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 μg/ml, and the area \nunder the curve was 235 ± 96.6 μg•hr/ml. \n \nMean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/l vs. \n2.6 mg/l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nLIFMIOR once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly (n=16), respectively. In an \nopen-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered \nas a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of \n25 mg/ml. \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady \nstate AUCs were 466 μg•hr/ml and 474 μg•hr/ml for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (N= 154) and \n25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. \n \nDistribution \nA biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central \nvolume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. \n \nElimination \nEtanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is \napproximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of \n0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of LIFMIOR in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. \n \nThere is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. \n \nLinearity \nDose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance \nacross the dosing range. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAlthough there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept \nto patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with \nacute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIncreased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The \npresence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \nElderly \nThe impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept \nserum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to \nestimates in patients less than 65 years of age. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with LIFMIOR, 69 patients (aged 4 to \n17 years) were administered 0.4 mg LIFMIOR/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration \nprofiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children \n(4 years of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared \nwith older children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older \nchildren (10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children \nwill have appreciably lower levels. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nPatients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum \nsteady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean \nconcentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nin patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult \npatients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicological studies with LIFMIOR, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. \nLIFMIOR was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. \nCarcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not \nperformed with LIFMIOR due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. \n \nLIFMIOR did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single \nsubcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. LIFMIOR did not elicit \ndose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous \nadministration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum \ndrug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended \ndose of 25 mg. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n25 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe  \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 25 mg of etanercept. \n \n50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe  \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 50 mg of etanercept. \n \nEtanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant \nDNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a \ndimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain \nof human tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc \ncomponent contains the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH1 region of IgG1. Etanercept \ncontains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The \nspecific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 106 units/mg. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nLIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including \nmethotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. \n \nLIFMIOR can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nLIFMIOR is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in \nadults not previously treated with methotrexate. \n \nLIFMIOR, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of \nprogression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \nTreatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \nchildren and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have \nproved intolerant of, methotrexate. \n  \nTreatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate \nresponse to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. \n \nTreatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an \ninadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy.  \n \nLIFMIOR has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nTreatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. LIFMIOR has been shown to \nimprove physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of \nperipheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of \nthe disease. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \nTreatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to \nconventional therapy. \n \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nTreatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of \ninflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs). \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nTreatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a \ncontraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or \npsoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nTreatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who \nare inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nLIFMIOR treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \nankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque \npsoriasis.

Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not \nresponding within this time period. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nThe recommended dose of LIFMIOR is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once \nweekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if \nnecessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with LIFMIOR should \ncontinue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks may be \nappropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in patients who \nshow no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the same guidance on \ntreatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once \nweekly.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required.

Patients weighing less than \n62.5 kg should be accurately dosed on a mg/kg basis using the powder and solvent for solution for \ninjection presentations or the powder for solution for injection presentations (see below for dosing for \nspecific indications). Patients weighing 62.5 kg or more, may be dosed using a fixed-dose pre-filled \nsyringe or pre-filled pen.  \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis  \nThe recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a \nsubcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of \n50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients \nwho show no response after 4 months. \n \nThe 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the \nweight of 25 kg. \n \nNo formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety \ndata from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar \nto that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg \nsubcutaneously (see section 5.1). \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 2 years in the indication \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) \nThe recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to \n24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\nIf re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be \nfollowed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 6 years in the indication \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nMethod of administration \nLIFMIOR is administered by subcutaneous injection (see section 6.6). \n \nComprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet, section 7, \"Instructions \nfor preparation and giving an injection of LIFMIOR”. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSepsis or risk of sepsis. \n \nTreatment with LIFMIOR should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic \nor localised infections. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trademark and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nInfections \nPatients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with LIFMIOR, taking \ninto consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 7 \nto 300 hours). \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal \ninfections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). \nThese infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). \nIn some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting \nin delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the \npatient’s risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be \nconsidered.  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with LIFMIOR should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of LIFMIOR should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of LIFMIOR in patients with a history of \nrecurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to \ninfections, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. \n \nTuberculosis \nCases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary \nlocation, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. \n \nBefore starting treatment with LIFMIOR, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(‘latent’) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history \nof tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, \nshould be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient’s alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\nrisk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, LIFMIOR therapy must not be initiated. If inactive (‘latent’) \ntuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis \ntherapy before the initiation of LIFMIOR, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this \nsituation, the benefit/risk balance of LIFMIOR therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis \n(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after LIFMIOR \ntreatment. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) \nand had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, has been reported. This includes \nreports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with LIFMIOR. For patients \nwho test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering LIFMIOR in patients \npreviously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active \nHBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate \ndata from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, LIFMIOR should \nbe stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nWorsening of hepatitis C \nThere have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving LIFMIOR. LIFMIOR should \nbe used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nConcurrent administration of LIFMIOR and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of \nserious infections and neutropenia compared to LIFMIOR alone. This combination has not \ndemonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of LIFMIOR and anakinra is not \nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept  \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAllergic reactions \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains latex (dry natural rubber) that may cause \nhypersensitivity reactions when handled by, or when LIFMIOR is administered to, persons with \nknown or possible latex sensitivity. \n \nAllergic reactions associated with LIFMIOR administration have been reported commonly. Allergic \nreactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious \nallergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, LIFMIOR therapy should be discontinued immediately and \nappropriate therapy initiated. \n \nImmunosuppression \nThe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, to affect host defences against \ninfections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune \nresponses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with LIFMIOR, there was \nno evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector cell populations. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n\nTwo juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of \naseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella \nvirus should temporarily discontinue LIFMIOR therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment \nwith Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nSolid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers) \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8).  \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been \nobserved among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the \noccurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients \nreceiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported \nin patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and \nleukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates risk estimation. \n \nBased on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nhaematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nLIFMIOR, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically \nassociated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and \nadolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nSkin cancers \nMelanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with \nTNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been \nreported very infrequently in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Periodic skin examination is \nrecommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nCombining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients \nreceiving LIFMIOR compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis.  \n \nVaccinations \nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with LIFMIOR. No data are available on the \nsecondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving LIFMIOR. In a \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, \n184 patients also received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, \nmost psoriatic arthritis patients receiving LIFMIOR were able to mount effective B-cell immune \nresponse to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and \nfew patients had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving LIFMIOR. The clinical \nsignificance of this is unknown. \n \nAutoantibody formation \nTreatment with LIFMIOR may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n\nHaematologic reactions \nRare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated \nwith LIFMIOR who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers \nshould be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or \ninfections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on LIFMIOR, they \nshould seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full \nblood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, LIFMIOR should be discontinued. \n \nNeurological disorders \nThere have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with LIFMIOR (see \nsection 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies \n(including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have \nbeen performed evaluating LIFMIOR therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other \nTNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful \nrisk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing \nLIFMIOR to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are \nconsidered to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease. \n \nCombination therapy \nIn a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of \nLIFMIOR and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of \nLIFMIOR when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies \nof LIFMIOR and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are \nongoing. The long-term safety of LIFMIOR in combination with other disease-modifying \nantirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established. \n \nThe use of LIFMIOR in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment \nof psoriasis has not been studied. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal \nor hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. \n \nCongestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) \nPhysicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who have congestive heart failure \n(CHF). There have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking LIFMIOR. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of new \nonset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of \nthese patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of \nLIFMIOR in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not \nconclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those \npatients assigned to LIFMIOR treatment.  \n \nAlcoholic hepatitis \nIn a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with LIFMIOR or \nplacebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, LIFMIOR was not efficacious, and the mortality \nrate in patients treated with LIFMIOR was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, \nLIFMIOR should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use \ncaution when using LIFMIOR in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. \n \nWegener's granulomatosis \nA placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with LIFMIOR in addition to \nstandard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median \nduration of 25 months, has not shown LIFMIOR to be an effective treatment for Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n\nhigher in patients treated with LIFMIOR than in the control group. LIFMIOR is not recommended for \nthe treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis. \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes \nThere have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of LIFMIOR in patients receiving \nmedication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nIn the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall \ndifferences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older \nwho received LIFMIOR were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be \nexercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of \ninfections. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating LIFMIOR therapy (see \nVaccinations, above). \n \nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \nThere have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR (see section \n4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nAdult patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious \ninfection when compared with patients treated with either LIFMIOR or anakinra alone (historical \ndata). \n \nIn addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background \nmethotrexate, patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of \nserious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with LIFMIOR (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). The combination LIFMIOR and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is \ntherefore not recommended. \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept  \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4).  \n \nConcurrent treatment with sulfasalazine  \nIn a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which \nLIFMIOR was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant \ndecrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with LIFMIOR or \nsulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use \ncaution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. \n \nNon-interactions \nIn clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when LIFMIOR was administered with \nglucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nanalgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with \nmethotrexate, digoxin or warfarin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid \nbecoming pregnant during LIFMIOR therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. \n \nPregnancy  \nDevelopmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the \nfoetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been \ninvestigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in \none observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first \ntrimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds \nratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most \ncommonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. \nNo change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In \nanother observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes \nin women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to \nnon-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds \nratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for \ncountry, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also \nshowed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year \nof life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. LIFMIOR should only be \nused during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nEtanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients \ntreated with LIFMIOR during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants \nmay be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the \nmother’s last dose of LIFMIOR is generally not recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \nEtanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In \nlactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected \nin the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be \nexcreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue LIFMIOR therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the \nbenefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nPreclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility \nand general reproductive performance are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, \nitching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, \nbronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, \nitching, and fever. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\nSerious adverse reactions have also been reported for LIFMIOR. TNF-antagonists, such as LIFMIOR, \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defenses against infection and cancer. \nSerious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with LIFMIOR. Reports have included \nfatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use \nof LIFMIOR, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma).   \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral \ndemyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with LIFMIOR use. There \nhave been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials in adults and on \npostmarketing experience. \n \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of \npatients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfection \n(including \nupper \nrespiratory \ntract \ninfection, \nbronchitis, \ncystitis, \nskin \ninfection)* \n\n Serious infections \n(including \npneumonia, \ncellulitis, arthritis \nbacterial, sepsis and \nparasitic infection)* \n \n\n \n\nTuberculosis, \nopportunistic \ninfection (including \ninvasive fungal, \nprotozoal, bacterial, \natypical \nmycobacterial, viral \ninfections, and \nLegionella)* \n\n Hepatitis B \nreactivation, \nlisteria \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps)  \n\n  Non-melanoma skin \ncancers* (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMalignant melanoma \n(see section 4.4), \nlymphoma, \nleukaemia  \n\n Merkel cell \ncarcinoma (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Thrombocytopenia, \nanaemia, \nleukopenia, \nneutropenia \n\n \n\nPancytopenia* Aplastic \nanaemia* \n\nHistiocytosis \nhaematophagic \n(macrophage \nactivation \nsyndrome)* \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Allergic \nreactions (see \nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders), \nautoantibody \nformation* \n\nVasculitis \n(including anti-\nneutrophilic \ncytoplasmic antibody \npositive vasculitis) \n\nSerious \nallergic/anaphylactic \nreactions (including \nangioedema, \nbronchospasm), \nsarcoidosis \n\n Worsening of \nsymptoms of \ndermatomyositis \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\n   CNS demyelinating \nevents suggestive of \nmultiple sclerosis or \nlocalised \ndemyelinating \nconditions, such as \noptic neuritis and \ntransverse myelitis \n(see section 4.4), \nperipheral \ndemyelinating events, \nincluding Guillain-\nBarré syndrome, \nchronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating \npolyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating \npolyneuropathy, and \nmultifocal motor \nneuropathy (see \nsection 4.4), seizure \n\n  \n\nEye disorders    Uveitis, scleritis    \nCardiac \ndisorders  \n\n  Worsening of \ncardiac failure \ncongestive (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nNew onset cardiac \nfailure congestive \n(see section 4.4) \n\n  \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, and \nmediastinal \ndisorders  \n\n   Interstitial lung \ndisease (including \npneumonitis and \npulmonary fibrosis)* \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders  \n\n  Elevated liver \nenzymes*\n\nAutoimmune \nhepatitis*\n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders  \n\n Pruritus, rash Angioedema, \npsoriasis (including \nnew onset or \nworsening and \npustular, primarily \npalms and soles), \nurticaria, \npsoriasiform rash \n\nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, cutaneous \nvasculitis (including \nhypersensitivity \nvasculitis), erythema \nmultiforme, lichenoid \nreactions \n\nToxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders  \n\n   Cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus, \nsubacute cutaneous \nlupus erythematosus, \nlupus-like syndrome \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions  \n\nInjection \nsite \nreactions \n(including \nbleeding, \nbruising, \nerythema, \nitching, \npain, \nswelling)* \n\nPyrexia     \n\n*see Description of selected adverse reactions, below.\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nOne hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 \nrheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with LIFMIOR for up to approximately 6 years, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\nincluding 231 patients treated with LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year \nactive-controlled study.

A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of \napproximately 2 years duration involving 240 LIFMIOR-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical \nstudies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were \nreported in LIFMIOR-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with \nLIFMIOR in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 \nnonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. \n \nIn a group of 7,416 patients treated with LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \nankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. \n \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4). \n \nInjection site reactions \nCompared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with LIFMIOR had a significantly \nhigher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in \nthe first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the \nmajority of injection site reactions in the LIFMIOR treatment groups, and the majority of patients who \nwere given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. \nAdditionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at \nthe most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at \nprevious injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. \n \nIn controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with \nLIFMIOR developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during \nthe first 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nSerious infections \nIn placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or \nrequiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% \nof rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at \nvarious sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, \nendocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, \nosteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin \ninfection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year \nactive-controlled study where patients were treated with either LIFMIOR alone, methotrexate alone or \nLIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the \ntreatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of LIFMIOR with \nmethotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. \n \nThere were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with LIFMIOR and those \ntreated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. \nSerious infections experienced by LIFMIOR-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, \npneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic \nshock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient \nreported a serious infection (pneumonia). \n \nSerious and fatal infections have been reported during use of LIFMIOR; reported pathogens include \nbacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few \nweeks after initiating treatment with LIFMIOR in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., \ndiabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their \nrheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). LIFMIOR treatment may increase mortality in patients with \nestablished sepsis. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42 \n\nOpportunistic infections have been reported in association with LIFMIOR, including invasive fungal, \nparasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and \nLegionella), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall \nincidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received LIFMIOR. The \nexposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, \napproximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive \nfungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, \nPneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma. Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half \nof the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports \nwith a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal \ninfections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \nAdult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid \narthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed \nnew positive ANA (≥1:40) was higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR (11%) than in placebo-\ntreated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded \nDNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with LIFMIOR \ncompared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated \nwith LIFMIOR compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with \nLIFMIOR who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to \nplacebo-treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with LIFMIOR on the development of \nautoimmune diseases is unknown. \n \nThere have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have \ndeveloped other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are \ncompatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. \n \nPancytopenia and aplastic anaemia \nThere have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal \noutcomes (see section 4.4). \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \ninterstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept \nand methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% \n(frequency uncommon). There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including \npneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nIn studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with LIFMIOR plus anakinra, a higher \nrate of serious infections compared to LIFMIOR alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) \ndeveloped neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3). While neutropenic, one patient \ndeveloped cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElevated liver enzymes \nIn the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the \nfrequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving \netanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind \nperiods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and \nmethotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was \n4.18% (frequency common). \n \nAutoimmune hepatitis \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \nautoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n43 \n\n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept \nand methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% \n(frequency uncommon).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in \nfrequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special \nconsiderations are discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nThe types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years \nwere generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric \npopulations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic \nmeningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, \ndepression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic \nshock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. \n \nIn one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children \nexperienced an infection while receiving LIFMIOR during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), \nand the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of \nopen-label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic \narthritis patients were similar to those seen in trials of LIFMIOR in adult patients with rheumatoid \narthritis, and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in \n69 juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of LIFMIOR compared to the 349 adult \nrheumatoid arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), \nnausea (9%, 1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and \nvomiting (13%, 0.74 events per patient year). \n \nThere were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials. \n \nThere have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with \nLIFMIOR from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive \nrechallenge (see section 4.4). \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nIn a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse \nevents reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The \nhighest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m2 followed by \nsubcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient \nmistakenly self-administered 62 mg LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without \nexperiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to LIFMIOR. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n44 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB01 \n \nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid \narthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with \npsoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque \npsoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in \npsoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of \nTNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and \nlymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the \n55-kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs \nexist naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF \nbiological activity. \n \nTNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on \ncross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher \naffinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of \nTNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion \nelement in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. \n \nMechanism of action \nMuch of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in \nplaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by \nTNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF \nbinding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF \nbiologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional \ndownstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or \nregulated by TNF. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThis section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, \none study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study \nin adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, \nthree studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nAdult patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The \nstudy evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least \none but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or \n25 mg LIFMIOR or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive \nmonths. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid \narthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.  \n \nACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR at 3 and 6 months than in \npatients treated with placebo (ACR 20: LIFMIOR 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and \n6 months, respectively: ACR 50: LIFMIOR 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, \nrespectively; p<0.01 LIFMIOR vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses).  \n \nApproximately 15% of subjects who received LIFMIOR achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and \nmonth 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving \nLIFMIOR, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and \nnearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate \nbetween placebo and 25 mg. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all components of the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n45 \n\nACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the \nACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which \nincluded disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status \nsubdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were \nimproved in patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to controls at 3 and 6 months.  \n \nAfter discontinuation of LIFMIOR, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. \nRe-introduction of treatment with LIFMIOR after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the \nsame magnitudes of responses as patients who received LIFMIOR without interruption of therapy \nbased on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years \nin open-label extension treatment trials when patients received LIFMIOR without interruption.  \n \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study \nwith blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active \nrheumatoid arthritis (<3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of \n10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 24 months. \nMethotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first \n8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset of \naction within 2 weeks with LIFMIOR 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was \nmaintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean \nHAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with LIFMIOR 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at \n12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was \nmaintained in Year 2 of this study. \nIn this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total \nSharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. \nRadiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg \nLIFMIOR dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. LIFMIOR \n25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The \ndifferences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and LIFMIOR \n25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below. \n \n\nRadiographic Progression: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs. Methotrexate in Patients with \nRA of <3 Years Duration \n\nC\nha\n\nng\ne \n\nfro\nm\n\n B\nas\n\nel\nin\n\ne\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nMTX\nLIFMIOR 25 mg\n\n12 Months 24 Months\n\nTSS Erosions JSN TSS Erosions JSN\n\n1.3\n\n0.8 0.9\n\n0.4* 0.4 0.4\n\n2.2\n\n1.2 1.3\n\n0.6*\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n*p < 0.05\n \n\nIn another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and \nradiographic progression in RA patients treated with LIFMIOR alone (25 mg twice weekly), \nmethotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of LIFMIOR and \nmethotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid \narthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to \nat least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nPatients in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher \nACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and \n52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). \nSignificant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. \n \n\nClinical Efficacy Results at 12 Months: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs. Methotrexate vs. \nLIFMIOR in Combination with Methotrexate in Patients with RA of 6 Months To 20 Years \n\nDuration \n\nEndpoint \n \n\nMethotrexate \n(n = 228) \n\nLIFMIOR \n(n = 223) \n\nLIFMIOR + \nMethotrexate \n\n(n = 231) \n \nACR Responsesa     \n\nACR 20 58.8% 65.5% 74.5% †,φ \nACR 50 36.4% 43.0% 63.2% †,φ \nACR 70 16.7% 22.0% 39.8% †,φ \n    \n\nDAS   \nBaseline scoreb 5.5 5.7 5.5 \nWeek 52 scoreb 3.0 3.0 2.3†,φ \nRemissionc 14% 18% 37%†,φ \n\n    \nHAQ    \n\nBaseline 1.7 1.7 1.8 \nWeek 52 1.1 1.0 0.8†,φ \n\na: Patients who did not complete 12 months in the study were considered to be non-responders. \nb: Values for Disease Activity Score (DAS) are means. \nc: Remission is defined as DAS <1.6. \nPairwise comparison p-values: † = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. \nmethotrexate and φ = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. LIFMIOR. \n\n \nRadiographic progression at 12 months was significantly less in the LIFMIOR group than in the \nmethotrexate group, while the combination was significantly better than either monotherapy at \nslowing radiographic progression (see figure below). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n47 \n\nRadiographic Progression: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs. Methotrexate vs. LIFMIOR in \nCombination with Methotrexate in Patients with RA of 6 Months To 20 Years Duration \n\n(12 Month Results) \n\n \nPairwise comparison p-values: * = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR vs. \nmethotrexate, † = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. \nmethotrexate and φ = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. \nLIFMIOR. \n\n \nSignificant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

Among patients who completed \na full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, \nrespectively. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly \nwere evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this \nstudy, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly and 153 \npatients received 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two \nLIFMIOR treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of \nRA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. A single \n50 mg/ml injection of LIFMIOR was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of \n25 mg/ml. \n \nAdult patients with psoriatic arthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active \npsoriatic arthritis (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: \n(1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules \nand presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or \n(5) spondylitis-like ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm \nin diameter. Patients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and \ncorticosteroids (24%).

Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on \ndose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a \nweek for 6 months. At the end of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label \nextension study for a total duration of up to 2 years. \n \nClinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 \nresponse and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC).

LIFMIOR \nwas significantly better than placebo in all measures of disease activity (p < 0.001), and responses \nwere similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. Quality of life in psoriatic arthritis \npatients was assessed at every timepoint using the disability index of the HAQ. The disability index \nscore was significantly improved at all timepoints in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR, \nrelative to placebo (p < 0.001).  \n \nRadiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study. Radiographs of hands and wrists \nwere obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. The modified TSS at 12 months is presented in \nthe table below. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were \nconsidered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at \n12 months was higher in the LIFMIOR group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, \nrespectively, p ≤ 0.001). The effect of LIFMIOR on radiographic progression was maintained in \npatients who continued on treatment during the second year.

A total of 401 \npatients were enrolled, from which 203 were treated with LIFMIOR.

Patients receiving \nDMARDs, NSAIDS, or corticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete \nankylosis of the spine were not included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on \ndose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered \nsubcutaneously twice a week for 6 months in 138 patients. \n \nThe primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a ≥20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 \nAssessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, \nBASFI, and inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 70 \nresponses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. \n \nCompared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, \nASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n50 \n\nResponses of Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis in a \nPlacebo-controlled Trial \n\n Percent of Patients \n  Ankylosing Spondylitis \nResponse \n\nPlacebo \nN = 139 \n\nLIFMIOR \nN = 138 \n\n ASAS 20    \n2 weeks 22 46a \n3 months 27 60a\n6 months 23 58a \n\n ASAS 50    \n2 weeks 7 24a \n3 months 13 45a \n6 months 10 42a \n\n ASAS 70   \n2 weeks 2 12b \n3 months 7 29b \n6 months  5 28b \n\n a: p <0.001, LIFMIOR vs. placebo \n b: p = 0.002, LIFMIOR vs. placebo \n\n \nAmong patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received LIFMIOR, the clinical responses were \napparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. \nResponses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline. \n \nSimilar results were obtained in the 2 smaller ankylosing spondylitis trials. \n \nIn a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered \nonce weekly vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy \nprofiles of the 50 mg once-weekly and 25 mg twice-weekly regimens were similar. \n \nAdult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) was \nassessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated \n215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), \ndefined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of axial spondyloarthritis but did not \nmeet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were also required to have an inadequate \nresponse or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the double-blind period, patients received \nLIFMIOR 50 mg weekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a \n40% improvement in at least three of the four ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the \nremaining domain. The double-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all \npatients receive LIFMIOR 50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks. MRIs of the sacroiliac joint \nand spine were obtained to assess inflammation at baseline and at weeks 12 and 104. \n \nCompared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in statistically significant improvement in the \nASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6. Significant improvement was also observed for the ASAS partial \nremission and BASDAI 50.

Adjusted mean change from baseline was 3.8 for LIFMIOR treated (n=95) \nversus 0.8 for placebo treated (n=105) patients (p<0.001). At week 104, the mean change from \nbaseline in the SPARCC score measured on MRI for all LIFMIOR-treated subjects was 4.64 for the \nSIJ (n=153) and 1.40 the spine (n=154). \n \nLIFMIOR showed statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 12 compared \nto placebo in most health-related quality of life and physical function assessments, including BASFI \n(Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), EuroQol 5D Overall Health State Score and SF-36 \nPhysical Component Score. \n \nClinical responses among nr-AxSpa patients who received LIFMIOR were apparent at the time of the \nfirst visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 2 years of therapy. Improvements in health-related \nquality of life and physical function were also maintained through 2 years of therapy. The 2 year data \ndid not reveal any new safety findings. At week 104, 8 subjects had progressed to a score of bilateral \nGrade 2 on spinal X-ray according to the modified New York Radiological Grade, indicative of axial \nspondyloarthropathy. \n \nAdult patients with plaque psoriasis \nLIFMIOR is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who “failed to \nrespond to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI<50 or PGA less than \ngood), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a \nsufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as \navailable. \n \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis \n(responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing \nLIFMIOR with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed \nin four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four \nstudies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least \na 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. \n \nStudy 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving \n≥ 10% of the body surface area who were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were \nrandomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for \n24 weeks. \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study \n1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. \nLIFMIOR was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a \nweek for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, \npatients received placebo or one of the above three LIFMIOR doses.

Patients in this study \nreceived a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg LIFMIOR, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all \npatients received open-label 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. \n \nStudy 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this \nstudy received a dose of 50 mg LIFMIOR or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients \nreceived open-label 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. \n \nIn study 1, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI \n75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). At 24 weeks, \n56% of patients in the LIFMIOR-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of \nplacebo-treated patients.

Clear or almost clear defined as 0 or 1 on a 0 to 5 scale. \n \nAmong patients with plaque psoriasis who received LIFMIOR, significant responses relative to \nplacebo were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of \ntherapy. \n \nStudy 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement \nof at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the \noccurrence of rebound (PASI ≥150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at \nleast half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, \nsymptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No \nrebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was \nsome evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with LIFMIOR in patients initially responding to \ntreatment. \n \nIn study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and \nhad their LIFMIOR dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 \nresponse through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the \nPASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n\nIn study 4, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 \n(38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once \nweekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI \n75 at week 24. \n \nIn long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where LIFMIOR was given without interruption, \nclinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. \n \nAn analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist \nclinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, \nthe choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and \nindividual patient needs. \n \nAntibodies to LIFMIOR \nAntibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. \nThese antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no \ncorrelation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. \n \nIn subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative \nrates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% \nof subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with \npsoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 4.8% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic \narthritis.  \n \nThe proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to \n3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of \nantibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis \nsubjects and psoriasis subjects. \n \nIn a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the \nincidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with \npolyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset \ntypes (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to \nseverely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, \nmethotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (< 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients \nreceived 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, \npatients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on LIFMIOR or receive placebo \nfor four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, \ndefined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six \nJRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent \nglobal assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare \nwas defined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not \nmore than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. \n \nIn part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In \npart 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on LIFMIOR experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of \n26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was \n≥ 116 days for patients who received LIFMIOR and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of \npatients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the \npatients remaining on LIFMIOR continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those \nwho received placebo did not improve. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54 \n\n \nIn an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of 4 \nyears at time of enrolment) continued to receive LIFMIOR for up to 10 years. Rates of serious adverse \nevents and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. \n \nLong-term safety of LIFMIOR monotherapy (n=103), LIFMIOR plus methotrexate (n=294), or \nmethotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 \nto 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections \nwere more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 \nversus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature. \n \nIn another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to \n4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related \narthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated \nwith LIFMIOR at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for \n12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and \ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and \nphysician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies.  \n \nStudies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of \ncontinued LIFMIOR therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating LIFMIOR \ntherapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or \nreducing the recommended dose of LIFMIOR following its long-term use in patients with JIA. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an \nsPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of \nreceiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. \n \nPatients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week \n12, more patients randomised to LIFMIOR had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those \nrandomised to placebo. \n \n\nPaediatric Plaque Psoriasis Outcomes at 12 Weeks \n\n LIFMIOR \n0.8 mg/kg Once \n\nWeekly \n(N = 106) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 105) \n\nPASI 75, n (%) 60 (57%)a 12 (11%) \nPASI 50, n (%) 79 (75%)a 24 (23%) \n\nsPGA “clear” or “minimal”, n (%) 56 (53%)a 14 (13%) \nAbbreviation: sPGA-static Physician Global Assessment \na. p < 0.0001 compared with placebo \n\n \nAfter the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to \n50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks.

Long-term experience with LIFMIOR was \ngenerally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEtanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) \nmethod, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products, as well as the parent compound. \n \nAbsorption \nEtanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum \nconcentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With \ntwice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high \nas those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg LIFMIOR, the average \nmaximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 μg/ml, and the area \nunder the curve was 235 ± 96.6 μg•hr/ml. \n \nMean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/l vs. \n2.6 mg/l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg \nLIFMIOR once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly (n=16), respectively. In an \nopen-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered \nas a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of \n25 mg/ml. \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady \nstate AUCs were 466 μg•hr/ml and 474 μg•hr/ml for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (N = 154) and \n25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. \n \nDistribution \nA biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central \nvolume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. \n \nElimination \nEtanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is \napproximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of \n0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of LIFMIOR in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. \n \nThere is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. \n \nLinearity \nDose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance \nacross the dosing range. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAlthough there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept \nto patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with \nacute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIncreased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The \npresence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n56 \n\nElderly \nThe impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept \nserum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to \nestimates in patients less than 65 years of age. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with LIFMIOR, 69 patients (aged 4 to \n17 years) were administered 0.4 mg LIFMIOR/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration \nprofiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 \nyears of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with \nolder children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children \n(10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have \nappreciably lower levels. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nPatients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum \nsteady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean \nconcentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed \nin patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult \npatients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicological studies with LIFMIOR, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. \nLIFMIOR was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. \nCarcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not \nperformed with LIFMIOR due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. \n \nLIFMIOR did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single \nsubcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. LIFMIOR did not elicit \ndose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous \nadministration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum \ndrug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended \ndose of 25 mg. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLIFMIOR 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 50 mg of etanercept. \n \nEtanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant \nDNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a \ndimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain \nof human tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc \ncomponent contains the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH1 region of IgG1. Etanercept \ncontains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The \nspecific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 106 units/mg. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nThe solution is clear, and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nLIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including \nmethotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. \n \nLIFMIOR can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nLIFMIOR is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in \nadults not previously treated with methotrexate. \n \nLIFMIOR, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of \nprogression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \nTreatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \nchildren and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have \nproved intolerant of, methotrexate.  \n \nTreatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate \nresponse to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n60 \n\n \nTreatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an \ninadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. \n \nLIFMIOR has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nTreatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. LIFMIOR has been shown to \nimprove physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of \nperipheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of \nthe disease. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \nTreatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to \nconventional therapy. \n \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nTreatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of \ninflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs). \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nTreatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a \ncontraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including ciclosporin, methotrexate or \npsoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nTreatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who \nare inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nLIFMIOR treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \nankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque \npsoriasis. Patients treated with LIFMIOR should be given the Patient Alert Card. \n \nThe LIFMIOR pre-filled pen is available in a 50 mg strength. Other presentations of LIFMIOR are \navailable in strengths of 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly is the recommended dose. Alternatively, 50 mg \nadministered once weekly has been shown to be safe and effective (see section 5.1). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nThe recommended dose is 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly, or 50 mg administered once \nweekly.  \n \nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not \nresponding within this time period. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nPlaque psoriasis \nThe recommended dose of LIFMIOR is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once \nweekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if \nnecessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with LIFMIOR should \ncontinue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks may be \nappropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in patients who \nshow no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the same guidance on \ntreatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once \nweekly.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18-64 years of \nage. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe dosage of LIFMIOR is based on body weight for paediatric patients. Patients weighing less than \n62.5 kg should be accurately dosed on a mg/kg basis using the powder and solvent for solution for \ninjection presentations or the powder for solution for injection presentations (see below for dosing for \nspecific indication). Patients weighing 62.5 kg or more, may be dosed using a fixed-dose pre-filled \nsyringe or pre-filled pen.  \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis  \nThe recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a \nsubcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of \n50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients \nwho show no response after 4 months. \n \nThe 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the \nweight of 25 kg. \n \nNo formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety \ndata from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar \nto that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg \nsubcutaneously (see section 5.1). \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 2 years in the indication \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) \nThe recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to 24 \nweeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. \n \nIf re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be \nfollowed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 6 years in the indication \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nMethod of administration \nLIFMIOR is administered by subcutaneous injection (see section 6.6).  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n62 \n\nComprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet, section 7, “Using the \nMYCLIC pre-filled pen to inject LIFMIOR.” \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSepsis or risk of sepsis. \n \nTreatment with LIFMIOR should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic \nor localised infections. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trademark and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nInfections \nPatients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with LIFMIOR, taking \ninto consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 7 \nto 300 hours). \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal \ninfections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). \nThese infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). \nIn some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting \nin delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the \npatient’s risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be \nconsidered.  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with LIFMIOR should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of LIFMIOR should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of LIFMIOR in patients with a history of \nrecurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections \nsuch as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. \n \nTuberculosis \nCases of active tuberculosis including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary \nlocation have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. \n \nBefore starting treatment with LIFMIOR, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(‘latent’) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history \nof tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, \nshould be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient’s alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the \nrisk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, LIFMIOR therapy must not be initiated. If inactive (‘latent’) \ntuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis \ntherapy before the initiation of LIFMIOR, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this \nsituation, the benefit/risk balance of LIFMIOR therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n63 \n\nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis \n(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after LIFMIOR \ntreatment. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) \nand had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, has been reported. This includes \nreports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with LIFMIOR. For patients \nwho test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering LIFMIOR in patients \npreviously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active \nHBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate \ndata from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, LIFMIOR should \nbe stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nWorsening of hepatitis C \nThere have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving LIFMIOR. LIFMIOR should \nbe used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nConcurrent administration of LIFMIOR and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of \nserious infections and neutropenia compared to LIFMIOR alone. This combination has not \ndemonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus the combined use of LIFMIOR and anakinra is not \nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept  \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions associated with LIFMIOR administration have been reported commonly. Allergic \nreactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious \nallergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, LIFMIOR therapy should be discontinued immediately and \nappropriate therapy initiated. \n \nThe needle cap of the pre-filled pen contains latex (dry natural rubber) that may cause hypersensitivity \nreactions when handled by or when LIFMIOR is administered to persons with known or possible latex \nsensitivity.  \n \nImmunosuppression \nThe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, to affect host defences against \ninfections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune \nresponses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with LIFMIOR, there was \nno evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector cell populations. \nTwo juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of \naseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella \nvirus should temporarily discontinue LIFMIOR therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment \nwith Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n64 \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nSolid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers) \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8).  \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been \nobserved among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the \noccurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients \nreceiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported \nin patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and \nleukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates risk estimation. \n \nBased on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nhaematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 \nyears of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nLIFMIOR, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically \nassociated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and \nadolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nSkin cancers \nMelanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with \nTNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been \nreported very infrequently in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Periodic skin examination is \nrecommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nCombining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients \nreceiving LIFMIOR compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis.  \n \nVaccinations \nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with LIFMIOR. No data are available on the \nsecondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving LIFMIOR. In a double blind, \nplacebo controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis 184 patients also \nreceived a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study most psoriatic \narthritis patients receiving LIFMIOR were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower and few patients \nhad two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving LIFMIOR. The clinical significance of \nthis is unknown. \n \nAutoantibody formation \nTreatment with LIFMIOR may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). \n \nHaematologic reactions \nRare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated \nwith LIFMIOR who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers \nshould be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or \ninfections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on LIFMIOR, they \nshould seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full \nblood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, LIFMIOR should be discontinued. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n65 \n\nNeurological disorders \nThere have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with LIFMIOR (see \nsection 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies \n(including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have \nbeen performed evaluating LIFMIOR therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other \nTNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful \nrisk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing \nLIFMIOR to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are \nconsidered to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease. \n \nCombination therapy \nIn a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of \nLIFMIOR and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of \nLIFMIOR when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies \nof LIFMIOR and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are \nongoing. The long-term safety of LIFMIOR in combination with other disease-modifying \nantirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established. \n \nThe use of LIFMIOR in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment \nof psoriasis has not been studied. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal \nor hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. \n \nCongestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) \nPhysicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who have congestive heart failure \n(CHF). There have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking LIFMIOR. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of new \nonset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of \nthese patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of \nLIFMIOR in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not \nconclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those \npatients assigned to LIFMIOR treatment.  \n \nAlcoholic hepatitis \nIn a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with LIFMIOR or \nplacebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, LIFMIOR was not efficacious, and the mortality \nrate in patients treated with LIFMIOR was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, \nLIFMIOR should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use \ncaution when using LIFMIOR in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. \n \nWegener's granulomatosis \nA placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with LIFMIOR in addition to \nstandard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median \nduration of 25 months, has not shown LIFMIOR to be an effective treatment for Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly \nhigher in patients treated with LIFMIOR than in the control group. LIFMIOR is not recommended for \nthe treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis. \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes \nThere have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of LIFMIOR in patients receiving \nmedication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n66 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nIn the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall \ndifferences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older \nwho received LIFMIOR were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be \nexercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of \ninfections. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating LIFMIOR therapy (see \nVaccinations, above). \n \nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \nThere have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR (see section \n4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nAdult patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious \ninfection when compared with patients treated with either LIFMIOR or anakinra alone (historical \ndata). \n \nIn addition, in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background \nmethotrexate, patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of \nserious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with LIFMIOR (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). The combination LIFMIOR and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit and is \ntherefore not recommended. \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept  \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4).  \n \nConcurrent treatment with sulfasalazine  \nIn a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which \nLIFMIOR was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant \ndecrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with LIFMIOR or \nsulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use \ncaution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. \n \nNon-interactions \nIn clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when LIFMIOR was administered with \nglucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nanalgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice. \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with \nmethotrexate, digoxin or warfarin. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n67 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid \nbecoming pregnant during LIFMIOR therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. \n \nPregnancy  \nDevelopmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the \nfoetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been \ninvestigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in \none observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first \ntrimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds \nratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most \ncommonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. \nNo change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In \nanother observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes \nin women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to \nnon-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds \nratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for \ncountry, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also \nshowed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year \nof life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. LIFMIOR should only be \nused during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nEtanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients \ntreated with LIFMIOR during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants \nmay be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the \nmother’s last dose of LIFMIOR is generally not recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \nEtanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In \nlactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected \nin the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be \nexcreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue LIFMIOR therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the \nbenefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nPreclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility \nand general reproductive performance are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, \nitching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, \nbronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, \nitching, and fever. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have also been reported for LIFMIOR. TNF-antagonists, such as LIFMIOR, \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defenses against infection and cancer. \nSerious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with LIFMIOR.

Various malignancies have also been reported with use \nof LIFMIOR, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma).   \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral \ndemyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with LIFMIOR use. There \nhave been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials in adults and on \npostmarketing experience. \n \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of \npatients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfection \n(including \nupper \nrespiratory \ntract \ninfection, \nbronchitis, \ncystitis, \nskin \ninfection)* \n\n Serious infections \n(including \npneumonia, \ncellulitis, arthritis \nbacterial, sepsis and \nparasitic infection)* \n \n\n \n\nTuberculosis, \nopportunistic \ninfection (including \ninvasive fungal, \nprotozoal, bacterial, \natypical \nmycobacterial, viral \ninfections, and \nLegionella)* \n\n Hepatitis B \nreactivation, \nlisteria \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps) \n\n  Non-melanoma skin \ncancers* (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMalignant melanoma \n(see section 4.4), \nlymphoma, \nleukaemia  \n\n Merkel cell \ncarcinoma (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Thrombocytopenia, \nanaemia, \nleukopenia, \nneutropenia \n\n \n\nPancytopenia* Aplastic \nanaemia* \n\nHistiocytosis \nhaematophagic \n(macrophage \nactivation \nsyndrome)* \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Allergic \nreactions (see \nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders), \nautoantibody \nformation* \n\nVasculitis \n(including anti-\nneutrophilic \ncytoplasmic antibody \npositive vasculitis) \n\nSerious \nallergic/anaphylactic \nreactions (including \nangioedema, \nbronchospasm), \nsarcoidosis \n\n Worsening of \nsymptoms of \ndermatomyositis \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\n   CNS demyelinating \nevents suggestive of \nmultiple sclerosis or \nlocalised \ndemyelinating \nconditions, such as \noptic neuritis and \ntransverse myelitis \n(see section 4.4), \nperipheral \ndemyelinating events, \nincluding Guillain-\nBarré syndrome, \nchronic inflammatory \n\n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n69 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\ndemyelinating \npolyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating \npolyneuropathy, and \nmultifocal motor \nneuropathy (see \nsection 4.4), seizure \n\nEye disorders    Uveitis, scleritis    \nCardiac \ndisorders  \n\n  Worsening of \ncardiac failure \ncongestive (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nNew onset cardiac \nfailure congestive \n(see section 4.4) \n\n  \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, and \nmediastinal \ndisorders  \n\n   Interstitial lung \ndisease (including \npneumonitis and \npulmonary fibrosis)* \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders  \n\n  Elevated liver \nenzymes* \n\nAutoimmune \nhepatitis* \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders  \n\n Pruritus, rash Angioedema, \npsoriasis (including \nnew onset or \nworsening and \npustular, primarily \npalms and soles), \nurticaria, \npsoriasiform rash \n\nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, cutaneous \nvasculitis (including \nhypersensitivity \nvasculitis), erythema \nmultiforme, lichenoid \nreactions \n\nToxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders  \n\n   Cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus, \nsubacute cutaneous \nlupus erythematosus, \nlupus-like syndrome \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions  \n\nInjection \nsite \nreactions \n(including \nbleeding, \nbruising, \nerythema, \nitching, \npain, \nswelling)* \n\nPyrexia     \n\n*see Description of selected adverse reactions, below. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nOne hundred and twenty-nine new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 rheumatoid \narthritis patients treated in clinical trials with LIFMIOR for up to approximately 6 years, including \n231 patients treated with LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year active-controlled \nstudy. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those expected for the \npopulation studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of approximately 2 \nyears duration involving 240 LIFMIOR-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical studies \nconducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were \nreported in LIFMIOR-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with \nLIFMIOR in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 \nnonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. \n \nIn a group of 7,416 patients treated with LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \nankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n70 \n\n \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4). \n \nInjection site reactions \nCompared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with LIFMIOR had a significantly \nhigher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in \nthe first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the \nmajority of injection site reactions in the LIFMIOR treatment groups, and the majority of patients who \nwere given treatment received topical preparations such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. \nAdditionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at \nthe most recent site of injection along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at \nprevious injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. \n \nIn controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with \nLIFMIOR developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during \nthe first 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nSerious infections \nIn placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life threatening, or \nrequiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% \nof rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at \nvarious sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, \nendocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, \nosteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin \ninfection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year \nactive-controlled study where patients were treated with either LIFMIOR alone, methotrexate alone or \nLIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the \ntreatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of LIFMIOR with \nmethotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. \n \nThere were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with LIFMIOR and those \ntreated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. \nSerious infections experienced by LIFMIOR-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, \npneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic \nshock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient \nreported a serious infection (pneumonia). \n \nSerious and fatal infections have been reported during use of LIFMIOR; reported pathogens include \nbacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few \nweeks after initiating treatment with LIFMIOR in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., \ndiabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their \nrheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). LIFMIOR treatment may increase mortality in patients with \nestablished sepsis. \n \nOpportunistic infections have been reported in association with LIFMIOR, including invasive fungal, \nparasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and \nLegionella), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall \nincidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received LIFMIOR. The \nexposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, \napproximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive \nfungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, \nPneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma. Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half \nof the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports \nwith a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal \ninfections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n71 \n\nAutoantibodies \nAdult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid \narthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed \nnew positive ANA (≥1:40) was higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR (11%) than in \nplacebo-treated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive \nanti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated \nwith LIFMIOR compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of \npatients treated with LIFMIOR compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of \npatients treated with LIFMIOR who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased \ncompared to placebo-treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with LIFMIOR on the \ndevelopment of autoimmune diseases is unknown. \n \nThere have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have \ndeveloped other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are \ncompatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. \n \nPancytopenia and aplastic anaemia \nThere have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal \noutcomes (see section 4.4). \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \ninterstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept \nand methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% \n(frequency uncommon). There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including \npneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nIn studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with LIFMIOR plus anakinra, a higher \nrate of serious infections compared to LIFMIOR alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) \ndeveloped neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3). While neutropenic, one patient \ndeveloped cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElevated liver enzymes \nIn the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the \nfrequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving \netanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind \nperiods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and \nmethotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was \n4.18% (frequency common). \n \nAutoimmune hepatitis \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \nautoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept \nand methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% \n(frequency uncommon).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in \nfrequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special \nconsiderations are discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n72 \n\nThe types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years \nwere generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric \npopulations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic \nmeningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, \ndepression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic \nshock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. \n \nIn one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children \nexperienced an infection while receiving LIFMIOR during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), \nand the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of \nopen-label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic \narthritis patients were similar to those seen in trials of LIFMIOR in adult patients with rheumatoid \narthritis, and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of LIFMIOR compared to the 349 adult \nrheumatoid arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), \nnausea (9%, 1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and \nvomiting (13%, 0.74 events per patient year). \n \nThere were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials. \n \nThere have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with \nLIFMIOR from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive \nrechallenge (see section 4.4). \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nIn a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse \nevents reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The \nhighest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m2 followed by \nsubcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient \nmistakenly self-administered 62 mg LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without \nexperiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to LIFMIOR. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB01 \n \nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid \narthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with \npsoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque \npsoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells including T-cells leads to increased TNF levels in psoriatic \nlesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNF-binding \nto its cell surface receptors and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and lymphotoxin \nare pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-kilodalton (p55) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n73 \n\nand 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs exist naturally in \nmembrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF biological activity. \n \nTNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on \ncross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors such as etanercept possess a higher \naffinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of \nTNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion \nelement in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. \n \nMechanism of action \nMuch of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in \nplaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by \nTNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF \nbinding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF \nbiologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional \ndownstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or \nregulated by TNF. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThis section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, \none study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study \nin adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, \nthree studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nAdult patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The \nstudy evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least \none but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or \n25 mg LIFMIOR or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive \nmonths. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid \narthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.  \n \nACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR at 3 and 6 months than in \npatients treated with placebo (ACR 20: LIFMIOR 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and \n6 months respectively: ACR 50: LIFMIOR 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, \nrespectively; p<0.01 LIFMIOR vs placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses).  \n \nApproximately 15% of subjects who received LIFMIOR achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and \nmonth 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving \nLIFMIOR, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and \nnearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate \nbetween placebo and 25 mg. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all components of the \nACR criteria as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR \nresponse criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which \nincluded disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status \nsubdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were \nimproved in patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to controls at 3 and 6 months.  \n \nAfter discontinuation of LIFMIOR, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. \nRe-introduction of treatment with LIFMIOR after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the \nsame magnitudes of responses as patients who received LIFMIOR without interruption of therapy \nbased on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years \nin open-label extension treatment trials when patients received LIFMIOR without interruption.  \n \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study \nwith blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active \nrheumatoid arthritis (<3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n74 \n\n10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR were administered SC twice a week for up to 24 months. Methotrexate \ndoses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first 8 weeks of the \ntrial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement including onset of action within \n2 weeks with LIFMIOR 25 mg was similar to that seen in the previous trials, and was maintained for \nup to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean HAQ scores of \n1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with LIFMIOR 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 12 months, with \nabout 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was maintained in \nYear 2 of this study. \n \nIn this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total \nSharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. \nRadiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg \nLIFMIOR dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. LIFMIOR \n25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The \ndifferences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and LIFMIOR \n25 mg.

In this \nstudy, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly and 153 \npatients received 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two \nLIFMIOR treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of \nRA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. A single \n50 mg/ml injection of LIFMIOR was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of \n25 mg/ml. \n \nAdult patients with psoriatic arthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active \npsoriatic arthritis (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: \n(1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules \nand presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-\nlike ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm in diameter. \nPatients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and corticosteroids \n(24%). Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for ≥ 2 months) could continue at a stable \ndose of ≤ 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on dose-finding studies in \npatients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a week for 6 months. At the \nend of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label extension study for a total \nduration of up to 2 years. \n \nClinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 \nresponse and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC).

A total of 401 \npatients were enrolled from which 203 were treated with LIFMIOR. The largest of these trials (n= \n277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis \ndefined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of ≥ 30 for average of duration and intensity of morning \nstiffness plus VAS scores of ≥ 30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global \nassessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 \nquestions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). Patients receiving \nDMARDs, NSAIDS, or corticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete \nankylosis of the spine were not included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on \ndose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered \nsubcutaneously twice a week for 6 months in 138 patients. \n \nThe primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a ≥20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 \nAssessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, \nBASFI, and inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 70 \nresponses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. \n \nCompared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, \nASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. \n \n\nResponses of Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis in a \nPlacebo-Controlled Trial \n\n Percent of Patients \n \n  Ankylosing Spondylitis \nResponse \n\nPlacebo \nN = 139 \n\nLIFMIOR \nN = 138 \n\n ASAS 20    \n2 weeks 22 46a \n3 months 27 60a \n6 months 23 58a \n\n ASAS 50    \n2 weeks 7 24a \n3 months 13 45a \n6 months 10 42a \n\n ASAS 70: \n2 weeks 2 12b \n3 months 7 29b \n6 months  5 28b \n\n a: p <0.001, LIFMIOR vs. Placebo \n b: p = 0.002, LIFMIOR vs. placebo \n\n \nAmong patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received LIFMIOR, the clinical responses were \napparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. \nResponses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline. \n \nSimilar results were obtained in the 2 smaller ankylosing spondylitis trials. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n79 \n\nIn a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered \nonce weekly vs 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy \nprofiles of the 50 mg once weekly and 25 mg twice weekly regimens were similar. \n \nAdult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) was \nassessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated \n215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), \ndefined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of axial spondyloarthritis but did not \nmeet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were also required to have an inadequate \nresponse or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the double-blind period, patients received \nLIFMIOR 50 mg weekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a \n40% improvement in at least three of the four ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the \nremaining domain. The double-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all \npatients receive LIFMIOR 50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks. MRIs of the sacroiliac joint \nand spine were obtained to assess inflammation at baseline and at weeks 12 and 104. \n \nCompared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in statistically significant improvement in the \nASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6.

Patients who “failed to \nrespond to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI<50 or PGA less than \ngood), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a \nsufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as \navailable. \n \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis \n(responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing \nLIFMIOR with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed \nin four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four \nstudies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least \na 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. \n \nStudy 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active but clinically stable plaque psoriasis involving ≥ \n10% of the body surface area that were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were \nrandomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for \n24 weeks. \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study \n1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. \nLIFMIOR was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a \nweek for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, \npatients received placebo or one of the above three LIFMIOR doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, \npatients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded LIFMIOR (25 mg twice a week); patients \nin the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally \nrandomised. \n \nStudy 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study \nreceived a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg LIFMIOR, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all \npatients received open-label 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. \n \nStudy 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this \nstudy received a dose of 50 mg LIFMIOR or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients \nreceived open-label 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. \n \nIn study 1, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI \n75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). At 24 weeks, \n56% of patients in the LIFMIOR-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of \nplacebo-treated patients.

Patients were observed off treatment for the \noccurrence of rebound (PASI ≥150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at \nleast half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, \nsymptoms of psoriasis gradually returned with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No \nrebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was \nsome evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with LIFMIOR in patients initially responding to \ntreatment. \n \nIn study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and \nhad their LIFMIOR dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 \nresponse through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the \nPASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. \n \nIn study 4, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 \n(38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once \nweekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI \n75 at week 24. \n \nIn long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where LIFMIOR was given without interruption, \nclinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. \n \nAn analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist \nclinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, \nthe choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and \nindividual patient needs. \n \nAntibodies to LIFMIOR \nAntibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. \nThese antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no \ncorrelation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n82 \n\n \nIn subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative \nrates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% \nof subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with \npsoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 4.8% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic \narthritis.  \n \nThe proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to \n3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of \nantibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis \nsubjects and psoriasis subjects. \n \nIn a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the \nincidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with \npolyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset \ntypes (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to \nseverely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, \nmethotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (< 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients \nreceived 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, \npatients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on LIFMIOR or receive placebo \nfor four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, \ndefined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six \nJRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent \nglobal assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare \nwas defined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not \nmore than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. \n \nIn part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In \npart 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on LIFMIOR experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of \n26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was ≥ \n116 days for patients who received LIFMIOR and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of \npatients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the \npatients remaining on LIFMIOR continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those \nwho received placebo did not improve. \n \nIn an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of 4 \nyears at time of enrolment) continued to receive LIFMIOR for up to 10 years. Rates of serious adverse \nevents and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. \n \nLong-term safety of LIFMIOR monotherapy (n=103), LIFMIOR plus methotrexate (n=294), or \nmethotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 \nto 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections \nwere more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 \nversus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature. \n \nIn another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to \n4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related \narthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated \nwith LIFMIOR at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for \n12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n83 \n\ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and \nphysician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies.  \n \nStudies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of \ncontinued LIFMIOR therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating LIFMIOR \ntherapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or \nreducing the recommended dose of LIFMIOR following its long-term use in patients with JIA. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by a \nsPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of \nreceiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. \n \nPatients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week \n12, more patients randomised to LIFMIOR had positive efficacy responses (e.g. PASI 75) than those \nrandomised to placebo. \n \n\n Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Outcomes at 12 Weeks \n\n LIFMIOR \n0.8 mg/kg Once \n\nWeekly \n(N = 106) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 105) \n\nPASI 75, n (%) 60 (57%)a 12 (11%) \nPASI 50, n (%) 79 (75%)a 24 (23%) \n\nsPGA “clear” or “minimal”, n (%) 56 (53%)a 14 (13%) \nAbbreviation: sPGA-static Physician Global Assessment. \na. p < 0.0001 compared with placebo. \n \n\n \nAfter the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to \n50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were \nsimilar to those observed in the double-blind period. \n \nDuring a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo \nexperienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to \nLIFMIOR. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks.  \n \nThe long-term safety and effectiveness of LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was \nassessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 2 \nyears beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with LIFMIOR was generally \ncomparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEtanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) \nmethod, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products as well as the parent compound. \n \nAbsorption \nEtanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum \nconcentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With \ntwice weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high \nas those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg LIFMIOR, the average \nmaximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 μg/ml, and the area \nunder the curve was 235 ± 96.6 μg•hr/ml. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n84 \n\n \nMean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/l vs. \n2.6 mg/l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg \nLIFMIOR once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly (n=16), respectively. In an open-\nlabel, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered as a \nsingle 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady \nstate AUCs were 466 μg•hr/ml and 474 μg•hr/ml for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (N = 154) and \n25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. \n \nDistribution \nA biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central \nvolume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. \n \nElimination \nEtanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is \napproximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of \n0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of LIFMIOR in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. \n \nThere is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. \n \nLinearity \nDose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance \nacross the dosing range. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAlthough there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept \nto patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with \nacute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIncreased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The \npresence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \nElderly \nThe impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept \nserum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to \nestimates in patients less than 65 years of age. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with LIFMIOR, 69 patients (aged 4 to 17 \nyears) were administered 0.4 mg LIFMIOR/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration \nprofiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 \nyears of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with \nolder children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children \n(10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have \nappreciably lower levels. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nPatients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n85 \n\nsteady state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean \nconcentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed \nin patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult \npatients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice weekly. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicological studies with LIFMIOR, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. \nLIFMIOR was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. \nCarcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not \nperformed with LIFMIOR due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. \n \nLIFMIOR did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single \nsubcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. LIFMIOR did not elicit \ndose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous \nadministration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum \ndrug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended \ndose of 25 mg. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLIFMIOR 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection for paediatric use. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 10 mg of etanercept. When reconstituted, the solution contains 10 mg/ml of \netanercept. \n \nEtanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant \nDNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a \ndimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain \nof human tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc \ncomponent contains the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH1 region of IgG1. Etanercept \ncontains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The \nspecific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 106 units/mg. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection (powder for injection). \n \nThe powder is white. The solvent is a clear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \nTreatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \nchildren and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have \nproved intolerant of, methotrexate.  \n \nTreatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate \nresponse to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. \n \nTreatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an \ninadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy.  \n \nLIFMIOR has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nTreatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who \nare inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n88 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nLIFMIOR treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis or paediatric plaque psoriasis. Patients treated \nwith LIFMIOR should be given the Patient Alert Card. \n \nPosology \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe 10 mg presentation is for paediatric patients prescribed a dose of 10 mg or less. Each vial of \nLIFMIOR 10 mg should be used on a single occasion in a single patient, and the remainder of the vial \nshould be discarded. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis  \nThe recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose) given twice weekly as a \nsubcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of \n50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients \nwho show no response after 4 months. \n \nNo formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety \ndata from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar \nto that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg \nsubcutaneously (see section 5.1). \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 2 years in the indication \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) \nThe recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to 24 \nweeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. \n \nIf re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be \nfollowed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 6 years in the indication \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nMethod of administration \nLIFMIOR is administered by subcutaneous injection. LIFMIOR powder for solution must be \nreconstituted in 1 ml of solvent before use (see section 6.6). \n \nComprehensive instructions for the preparation and administration of the reconstituted LIFMIOR vial \nare given in the package leaflet, section 7, \"Instructions for preparation and giving an injection of \nLIFMIOR.\" \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSepsis or risk of sepsis. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n89 \n\nTreatment with LIFMIOR should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic \nor localised infections. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trademark and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nInfections \nPatients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with LIFMIOR, taking \ninto consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 7 \nto 300 hours). \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal \ninfections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). \nThese infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). \nIn some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting \nin delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the \npatient’s risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be \nconsidered.  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with LIFMIOR should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of LIFMIOR should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of LIFMIOR in patients with a history of \nrecurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to \ninfections, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. \n \nTuberculosis \nCases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary \nlocation, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. \n \nBefore starting treatment with LIFMIOR, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(‘latent’) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history \nof tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, \nshould be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient’s alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the \nrisk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, LIFMIOR therapy must not be initiated. If inactive (‘latent’) \ntuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis \ntherapy before the initiation of LIFMIOR, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this \nsituation, the benefit/risk balance of LIFMIOR therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis \n(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after LIFMIOR \ntreatment. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) \nand had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, has been reported. This includes \nreports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with LIFMIOR. For patients \nwho test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering LIFMIOR in patients \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n90 \n\npreviously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active \nHBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate \ndata from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, LIFMIOR should \nbe stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nWorsening of hepatitis C \nThere have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving LIFMIOR. LIFMIOR should \nbe used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nConcurrent administration of LIFMIOR and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of \nserious infections and neutropenia compared to LIFMIOR alone. This combination has not \ndemonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of LIFMIOR and anakinra is not \nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept  \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions associated with LIFMIOR administration have been reported commonly. Allergic \nreactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious \nallergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, LIFMIOR therapy should be discontinued immediately and \nappropriate therapy initiated. \n \nImmunosuppression \nThe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, to affect host defences against \ninfections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune \nresponses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with LIFMIOR, there was \nno evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector cell populations. \n \nTwo juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of \naseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella \nvirus should temporarily discontinue LIFMIOR therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment \nwith Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nSolid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers) \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8).  \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been \nobserved among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the \noccurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients \nreceiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported \nin patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and \nleukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates risk estimation. \n \nBased on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nhaematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n91 \n\nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 \nyears of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nLIFMIOR, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically \nassociated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and \nadolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nSkin cancers \nMelanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with \nTNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been \nreported very infrequently in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Periodic skin examination is \nrecommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nCombining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients \nreceiving LIFMIOR compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis.  \n \nVaccinations \nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with LIFMIOR. No data are available on the \nsecondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving LIFMIOR. In a \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, \n184 patients also received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, \nmost psoriatic arthritis patients receiving LIFMIOR were able to mount effective B-cell immune \nresponse to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and \nfew patients had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving LIFMIOR. The clinical \nsignificance of this is unknown. \n \nAutoantibody formation \nTreatment with LIFMIOR may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). \n \nHaematologic reactions \nRare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated \nwith LIFMIOR who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers \nshould be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or \ninfections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on LIFMIOR, they \nshould seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full \nblood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, LIFMIOR should be discontinued. \n \nNeurological disorders \nThere have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with LIFMIOR (see \nsection 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies \n(including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have \nbeen performed evaluating LIFMIOR therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other \nTNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful \nrisk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing \nLIFMIOR to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are \nconsidered to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease. \n \nCombination therapy \nIn a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, the \ncombination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety \nprofile of LIFMIOR when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported \nin studies of LIFMIOR and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n92 \n\ncombination are ongoing. The long-term safety of LIFMIOR in combination with other \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established. \n \nThe use of LIFMIOR in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment \nof psoriasis has not been studied. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal \nor hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. \n \nCongestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) \nPhysicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who have congestive heart failure \n(CHF). There have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking LIFMIOR. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of new \nonset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of \nthese patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of \nLIFMIOR in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not \nconclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those \npatients assigned to LIFMIOR treatment.  \n \nAlcoholic hepatitis \nIn a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with LIFMIOR or \nplacebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, LIFMIOR was not efficacious, and the mortality \nrate in patients treated with LIFMIOR was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, \nLIFMIOR should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use \ncaution when using LIFMIOR in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. \n \nWegener's granulomatosis \nA placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with LIFMIOR in addition to \nstandard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median \nduration of 25 months, has not shown LIFMIOR to be an effective treatment for Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly \nhigher in patients treated with LIFMIOR than in the control group. LIFMIOR is not recommended for \nthe treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis. \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes \nThere have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of LIFMIOR in patients receiving \nmedication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nIn the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall \ndifferences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older \nwho received LIFMIOR were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be \nexercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of \ninfections. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nVaccinations  \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating LIFMIOR therapy (see \nVaccinations, above). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n93 \n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \nThere have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR (see section \n4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nAdult patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious \ninfection when compared with patients treated with either LIFMIOR or anakinra alone (historical \ndata). \n \nIn addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background \nmethotrexate, patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of \nserious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with LIFMIOR (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). The combination LIFMIOR and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is \ntherefore not recommended. \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept  \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4).  \n \nConcurrent treatment with sulfasalazine  \nIn a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which \nLIFMIOR was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant \ndecrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with LIFMIOR or \nsulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use \ncaution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. \n \nNon-interactions \nIn clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when LIFMIOR was administered with \nglucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nanalgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice. \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with \nmethotrexate, digoxin or warfarin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid \nbecoming pregnant during LIFMIOR therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. \n \nPregnancy  \nDevelopmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the \nfoetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been \ninvestigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in \none observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first \ntrimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds \nratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most \ncommonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. \nNo change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In \nanother observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes \nin women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to \nnon-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds \nratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for \ncountry, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n94 \n\nshowed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year \nof life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. LIFMIOR should only be \nused during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nEtanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients \ntreated with LIFMIOR during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants \nmay be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the \nmother’s last dose of LIFMIOR is generally not recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \nEtanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In \nlactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected \nin the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be \nexcreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue LIFMIOR therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the \nbenefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nPreclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility \nand general reproductive performance are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nPaediatric population \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in \nfrequency and type to those seen in adult patients (see below, Undesirable effects in adults). \nDifferences from adults and other special considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nThe types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years \nwere generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric \npopulations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic \nmeningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, \ndepression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic \nshock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. \n \nIn one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children \nexperienced an infection while receiving LIFMIOR during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), \nand the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of \nopen-label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic \narthritis patients were similar to those seen in trials of LIFMIOR in adult patients with rheumatoid \narthritis, and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of LIFMIOR compared to the 349 adult \nrheumatoid arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), \nnausea (9%, 1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and \nvomiting (13%, 0.74 events per patient year). \n \nThere were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n95 \n\nThere have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with \nLIFMIOR from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive \nrechallenge (see section 4.4). \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nIn a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse \nevents reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. \n \nAdult population \n \nUndesirable effects in adults \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, \nitching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, \nbronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, \nitching, and fever. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have also been reported for LIFMIOR. TNF-antagonists, such as LIFMIOR, \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defenses against infection and cancer. \nSerious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with LIFMIOR. Reports have included \nfatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use \nof LIFMIOR, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma).   \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral \ndemyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with LIFMIOR use. There \nhave been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials in adults and on \npostmarketing experience. \n \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of \npatients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfection \n(including \nupper \nrespiratory \ntract \ninfection, \nbronchitis, \ncystitis, \nskin \ninfection)* \n\n Serious infections \n(including \npneumonia, \ncellulitis, arthritis \nbacterial, sepsis and \nparasitic infection)* \n \n\n \n\nTuberculosis, \nopportunistic \ninfection (including \ninvasive fungal, \nprotozoal, bacterial, \natypical \nmycobacterial, viral \ninfections, and \nLegionella)* \n\n Hepatitis B \nreactivation, \nlisteria \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps)  \n\n  Non-melanoma skin \ncancers* (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMalignant melanoma \n(see section 4.4), \nlymphoma, \nleukaemia  \n\n Merkel cell \ncarcinoma (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Thrombocytopenia, \nanaemia, \nleukopenia, \nneutropenia \n\nPancytopenia* Aplastic \nanaemia* \n\nHistiocytosis \nhaematophagic \n(macrophage \nactivation \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n96 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\n syndrome)† \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Allergic \nreactions (see \nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders), \nautoantibody \nformation* \n\nVasculitis \n(including anti-\nneutrophilic \ncytoplasmic antibody \npositive vasculitis) \n\nSerious \nallergic/anaphylactic \nreactions (including \nangioedema, \nbronchospasm), \nsarcoidosis \n\n Worsening of \nsymptoms of \ndermatomyositis \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\n   CNS demyelinating \nevents suggestive of \nmultiple sclerosis or \nlocalised \ndemyelinating \nconditions, such as \noptic neuritis and \ntransverse myelitis \n(see section 4.4), \nperipheral \ndemyelinating events, \nincluding Guillain-\nBarré syndrome, \nchronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating \npolyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating \npolyneuropathy, and \nmultifocal motor \nneuropathy (see \nsection 4.4), seizure \n\n  \n\nEye disorders    Uveitis, scleritis    \nCardiac \ndisorders  \n\n  Worsening of \ncardiac failure \ncongestive (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nNew onset cardiac \nfailure congestive \n(see section 4.4) \n\n  \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, and \nmediastinal \ndisorders  \n\n   Interstitial lung \ndisease (including \npneumonitis and \npulmonary fibrosis)*\n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders  \n\n  Elevated liver \nenzymes* \n\nAutoimmune \nhepatitis* \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders  \n\n Pruritus, rash Angioedema, \npsoriasis (including \nnew onset or \nworsening and \npustular, primarily \npalms and soles), \nurticaria, \npsoriasiform rash \n\nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, cutaneous \nvasculitis (including \nhypersensitivity \nvasculitis), erythema \nmultiforme, lichenoid \nreactions \n\nToxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders  \n\n   Cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus, \nsubacute cutaneous \nlupus erythematosus, \nlupus-like syndrome \n\n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n97 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n≥ 1/10 \n \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10 \n \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000 \n \n\nVery Rare \n< 1/10,000 \n \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n(Cannot be \nEstimated \nfrom Available \nData) \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions  \n\nInjection \nsite \nreactions \n(including \nbleeding, \nbruising, \nerythema, \nitching, \npain, \nswelling)* \n\nPyrexia     \n\n*see Description of selected adverse reactions, below. \n†Please see sub-section ‘Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis’ above. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nOne hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 \nrheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with LIFMIOR for up to approximately 6 years, \nincluding 231 patients treated with LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year \nactive-controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those \nexpected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of \napproximately 2 years duration involving 240 LIFMIOR-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical \nstudies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were \nreported in LIFMIOR-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with \nLIFMIOR in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 \nnonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. \n \nIn a group of 7,416 patients treated with LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \nankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. \n \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4). \n \nInjection site reactions \nCompared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with LIFMIOR had a significantly \nhigher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in \nthe first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the \nmajority of injection site reactions in the LIFMIOR treatment groups, and the majority of patients who \nwere given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. \nAdditionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at \nthe most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at \nprevious injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. \n \nIn controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with \nLIFMIOR developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during \nthe first 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nSerious infections \nIn placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or \nrequiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% \nof rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at \nvarious sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, \nendocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, \nosteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n98 \n\ninfection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year \nactive-controlled study where patients were treated with either LIFMIOR alone, methotrexate alone or \nLIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the \ntreatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of LIFMIOR with \nmethotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. \n \nThere were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with LIFMIOR and those \ntreated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. \nSerious infections experienced by LIFMIOR-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, \npneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic \nshock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient \nreported a serious infection (pneumonia). \n \nSerious and fatal infections have been reported during use of LIFMIOR; reported pathogens include \nbacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few \nweeks after initiating treatment with LIFMIOR in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., \ndiabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their \nrheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). LIFMIOR treatment may increase mortality in patients with \nestablished sepsis. \n \nOpportunistic infections have been reported in association with LIFMIOR, including invasive fungal, \nparasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and \nLegionella), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall \nincidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received LIFMIOR. The \nexposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, \napproximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive \nfungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, \nPneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma. Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half \nof the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports \nwith a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal \ninfections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \nAdult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid \narthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed \nnew positive ANA (≥1:40) was higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR (11%) than in placebo-\ntreated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded \nDNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with LIFMIOR \ncompared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated \nwith LIFMIOR compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with \nLIFMIOR who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to \nplacebo-treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with LIFMIOR on the development of \nautoimmune diseases is unknown. \n \nThere have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have \ndeveloped other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are \ncompatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. \n \nPancytopenia and aplastic anaemia \nThere have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal \noutcomes (see section 4.4). \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \ninterstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept \nand methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n99 \n\n(frequency uncommon). There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including \npneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra  \nIn studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with LIFMIOR plus anakinra, a higher \nrate of serious infections compared to LIFMIOR alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) \ndeveloped neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3). While neutropenic, one patient \ndeveloped cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElevated liver enzymes \nIn the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the \nfrequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving \netanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind \nperiods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and \nmethotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was \n4.18% (frequency common). \n \nAutoimmune hepatitis \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \nautoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept \nand methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% \n(frequency uncommon). \n \nPaediatric population \nSee Summary of the safety profile, above. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The \nhighest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m2 followed by \nsubcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient \nmistakenly self-administered 62 mg LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without \nexperiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to LIFMIOR. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB01 \n \nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid \narthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with \npsoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque \npsoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in \npsoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of \nTNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and \nlymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the \n55-kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n100 \n\nexist naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF \nbiological activity. \n \nTNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on \ncross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher \naffinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of \nTNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion \nelement in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. \n \nMechanism of action \nMuch of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in \nplaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by \nTNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF \nbinding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF \nbiologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional \ndownstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or \nregulated by TNF. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThis section presents data from three studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one study in paediatric \npatients with plaque psoriasis, four studies in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, and four studies in \nadults with plaque psoriasis. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with \npolyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset \ntypes (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to \nseverely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, \nmethotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (< 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients \nreceived 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, \npatients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on LIFMIOR or receive placebo \nfor four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, \ndefined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six \nJRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent \nglobal assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare \nwas defined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not \nmore than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. \n \nIn part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In \npart 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on LIFMIOR experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of \n26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was \n≥ 116 days for patients who received LIFMIOR and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of \npatients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the \npatients remaining on LIFMIOR continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those \nwho received placebo did not improve. \n \nIn an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of \n4 years at time of enrolment) continued to receive LIFMIOR for up to 10 years. Rates of serious \nadverse events and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. \n \nLong-term safety of LIFMIOR monotherapy (n=103), LIFMIOR plus methotrexate (n=294), or \nmethotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 \nto 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n101 \n\nwere more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 \nversus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature. \n \nIn another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to \n4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related \narthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated \nwith LIFMIOR at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for \n12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and \ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and \nphysician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies.  \n \nStudies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of \ncontinued LIFMIOR therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating LIFMIOR \ntherapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or \nreducing the recommended dose of LIFMIOR following its long-term use in patients with JIA. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an \nsPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of \nreceiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. \n \nPatients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week \n12, more patients randomised to LIFMIOR had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those \nrandomised to placebo. \n \n\nPaediatric Plaque Psoriasis Outcomes at 12 Weeks \n\n LIFMIOR \n0.8 mg/kg Once \n\nWeekly \n(N = 106) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 105) \n\nPASI 75, n (%) 60 (57%)a 12 (11%) \nPASI 50, n (%) 79 (75%)a 24 (23%) \n\nsPGA “clear” or “minimal”, n (%) 56 (53%)a 14 (13%) \nAbbreviation: sPGA-static Physician Global Assessment \na. p < 0.0001 compared with placebo \n\n \nAfter the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to \n50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were \nsimilar to those observed in the double-blind period. \n \nDuring a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo \nexperienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to \nLIFMIOR. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks.  \n \nThe long-term safety and effectiveness of LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was \nassessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 2 \nyears beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with LIFMIOR was generally \ncomparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings.  \n \nAdult patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The \nstudy evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least \none but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or \n25 mg LIFMIOR or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n102 \n\nmonths. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid \narthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. \n \nACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR at 3 and 6 months than in \npatients treated with placebo (ACR 20: LIFMIOR 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and \n6 months, respectively: ACR 50: LIFMIOR 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, \nrespectively; p<0.01 LIFMIOR vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses).  \n \nApproximately 15% of subjects who received LIFMIOR achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and \nmonth 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving \nLIFMIOR, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and \nnearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate \nbetween placebo and 25 mg. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all components of the \nACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the \nACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which \nincluded disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status \nsubdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were \nimproved in patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to controls at 3 and 6 months.  \n \nAfter discontinuation of LIFMIOR, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. \nRe-introduction of treatment with LIFMIOR after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the \nsame magnitudes of responses as patients who received LIFMIOR without interruption of therapy \nbased on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years \nin open-label extension treatment trials when patients received LIFMIOR without interruption.  \n \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study \nwith blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active \nrheumatoid arthritis (<3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of \n10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 24 months. \nMethotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first \n8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset of \naction within 2 weeks with LIFMIOR 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was \nmaintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean \nHAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with LIFMIOR 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at \n12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was \nmaintained in Year 2 of this study. \n \nIn this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total \nSharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. \nRadiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg \nLIFMIOR dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. LIFMIOR \n25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The \ndifferences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and LIFMIOR \n25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n103 \n\nRadiographic Progression: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs. Methotrexate in Patients with \nRA of <3 Years Duration \n\nC\nha\n\nng\ne \n\nfro\nm\n\n B\nas\n\nel\nin\n\ne\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nMTX\nLIFMIOR 25 mg\n\n12 Months 24 Months\n\nTSS Erosions JSN TSS Erosions JSN\n\n1.3\n\n0.8 0.9\n\n0.4* 0.4 0.4\n\n2.2\n\n1.2 1.3\n\n0.6*\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n*p < 0.05\n \n\nIn another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and \nradiographic progression in RA patients treated with LIFMIOR alone (25 mg twice weekly), \nmethotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of LIFMIOR and \nmethotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid \narthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to \nat least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. \n \nPatients in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher \nACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and \n52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). \nSignificant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n104 \n\nClinical Efficacy Results at 12 Months: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs. Methotrexate \nvs. LIFMIOR in Combination with Methotrexate in Patients with RA of 6 Months \n\nTo 20 Years Duration \n\nEndpoint \n \n\nMethotrexate \n(n = 228) \n\nLIFMIOR \n(n = 223) \n\nLIFMIOR + \nMethotrexate \n\n(n = 231) \n \nACR Responsesa     \n\nACR 20 58.8% 65.5% 74.5% †,φ \nACR 50 36.4% 43.0% 63.2% †,φ \nACR 70 16.7% 22.0% 39.8% †,φ \n    \n\nDAS    \nBaseline scoreb 5.5 5.7 5.5 \nWeek 52 scoreb 3.0 3.0 2.3†,φ \nRemissionc 14% 18% 37%†,φ \n    \n\nHAQ    \nBaseline 1.7 1.7 1.8 \nWeek 52 1.1 1.0 0.8†,φ \n\na: Patients who did not complete 12 months in the study were considered to be non-\nresponders. \nb: Values for Disease Activity Score (DAS) are means. \nc: Remission is defined as DAS <1.6. \nPairwise comparison p-values: † = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate \nvs. methotrexate and φ = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. \nLIFMIOR. \n\n \nRadiographic progression at 12 months was significantly less in the LIFMIOR group than in the \nmethotrexate group, while the combination was significantly better than either monotherapy at \nslowing radiographic progression (see figure below). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n105 \n\nRadiographic Progression: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs. Methotrexate vs. LIFMIOR in \nCombination with Methotrexate in Patients with RA of 6 Months To 20 Years Duration \n\n(12 Month Results) \n\n \nPairwise comparison p-values: * = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR vs. \nmethotrexate, † = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. \nmethotrexate and φ = p < 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. \nLIFMIOR. \n\n \nSignificant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

Among patients who completed \na full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, \nrespectively. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly \nwere evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this \nstudy, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly and 153 \npatients received 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two \nLIFMIOR treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of \nRA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. \n \nAdult patients with plaque psoriasis \nLIFMIOR is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who “failed to \nrespond to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI<50 or PGA less than \ngood), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a \nsufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as \navailable. \n \nThe efficacy of LIFMIOR versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis \n(responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing \nLIFMIOR with other systemic therapies.

One hundred and twelve (112) patients were \nrandomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for \n24 weeks. \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study \n1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. \nLIFMIOR was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a \nweek for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, \npatients received placebo or one of the above three LIFMIOR doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, \npatients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded LIFMIOR (25 mg twice a week); patients \nin the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally \nrandomised. \n \nStudy 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study \nreceived a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg LIFMIOR, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all \npatients received open-label 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. \n \nStudy 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this \nstudy received a dose of 50 mg LIFMIOR or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients \nreceived open-label 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. \n \nIn study 1, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI \n75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). At 24 weeks, \n56% of patients in the LIFMIOR-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of \nplacebo-treated patients.

During the withdrawal period, \nsymptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No \nrebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was \nsome evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with LIFMIOR in patients initially responding to \ntreatment. \n \nIn study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and \nhad their LIFMIOR dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 \nresponse through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the \nPASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. \n \nIn study 4, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 \n(38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once \nweekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI \n75 at week 24. \n \nIn long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where LIFMIOR was given without interruption, \nclinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. \n \nAn analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist \nclinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, \nthe choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and \nindividual patient needs. \n \nAntibodies to LIFMIOR \nAntibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. \nThese antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no \ncorrelation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. \n \nIn subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative \nrates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% \nof subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with \npsoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 4.8% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic \narthritis.  \n \nThe proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to \n3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of \nantibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis \nsubjects and psoriasis subjects. \n \nIn a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the \nincidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEtanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) \nmethod, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products as well as the parent compound. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAlthough there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept \nto patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with \nacute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n108 \n\nHepatic impairment \nIncreased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The \npresence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with LIFMIOR, 69 patients (aged 4 to 17 \nyears) were administered 0.4 mg LIFMIOR/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration \nprofiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 \nyears of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with \nolder children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children \n(10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have \nappreciably lower levels. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nPatients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum \nsteady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean \nconcentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed \nin patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult \npatients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. \n \nAdults \n \nAbsorption \nEtanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum \nconcentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With \ntwice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high \nas those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg LIFMIOR, the average \nmaximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 μg/ml, and the area \nunder the curve was 235 ± 96.6 μg•hr/ml. Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated \nRA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/l vs. 2.6 mg/l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of \n297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly \n(n=16), respectively. In an open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy \nvolunteers, etanercept administered as a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to \ntwo simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady \nstate AUCs were 466 μg•hr/ml and 474 μg•hr/ml for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (N= 154) and \n25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. \n \nDistribution \nA biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central \nvolume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. \n \nElimination \nEtanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is \napproximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of \n0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of LIFMIOR in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. \nThere is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n109 \n\nLinearity \nDose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance \nacross the dosing range. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicological studies with LIFMIOR, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. \nLIFMIOR was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. \nCarcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not \nperformed with LIFMIOR due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. \n \nLIFMIOR did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single \nsubcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. LIFMIOR did not elicit \ndose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous \nadministration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum \ndrug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended \ndose of 25 mg. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of \nsection 4 for how to report side effects. \n\n \nRead all (both sides) of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it \ncontains important information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety information \n\nthat you need to be aware of before and during treatment with LIFMIOR. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you or a child in your care. Do not pass it on to others. It \n\nmay harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours or those of the child you are \ncaring for. \n\n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \nInformation in this leaflet is organised under the following 7 sections: \n \n1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR \n3. How to use LIFMIOR \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store LIFMIOR \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR (See overleaf) \n \n \n1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for \n \nLIFMIOR is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein \nin the body that causes inflammation. LIFMIOR works by reducing the inflammation associated with \ncertain diseases. \n \nIn adults (aged 18 and over), LIFMIOR can be used for moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis, \npsoriatic arthritis, severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate \nor severe psoriasis – in each case usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well \nenough or are not suitable for you. \n \nFor rheumatoid arthritis, LIFMIOR is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may \nalso be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in \ncombination with methotrexate, LIFMIOR can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the \nrheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. \n \nFor psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, LIFMIOR can improve your ability to \ndo normal daily activities. For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., \nhands, wrists and feet), LIFMIOR can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the \ndisease.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n140 \n\nLIFMIOR is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents \n \n\n• For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not \nworked well enough or is not suitable for them: \n \n\n• Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \npatients from the age of 2 years \n\n \n• Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years \n\n \n• For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years when other widely used \n\ntreatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them \n \n• Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years who have had an inadequate response to (or \n\nare unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR  \n \nDo not use LIFMIOR \n \n• if you, or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients of \n\nLIFMIOR (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest \ntightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n• if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If \nyou are not sure, please contact your doctor. \n\n• if you or the child, have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking LIFMIOR. \n \n• Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, \n\nwheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. \n• Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major \n\nsurgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with LIFMIOR. \n• Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or \n\nsuffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. \n• Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If you \n\nor the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the presence of \ninfections after you or the child stop using LIFMIOR. \n\n• Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR, \nyour doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting LIFMIOR. This \nmay include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of \nthese tests should be recorded on the Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your \ndoctor if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with \nsomeone who has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, \nweight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell \nyour doctor immediately. \n\n• Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor \nshould test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with \nLIFMIOR. Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who \nhave previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using \nLIFMIOR. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n141 \n\n• Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to \nmonitor the treatment with LIFMIOR in case the infection worsens. \n\n• Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or \nsymptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms \nmay point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require \ndiscontinuation of LIFMIOR. \n\n• Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, \noptic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of \nthe spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if LIFMIOR is an appropriate treatment. \n\n• Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart \nfailure, because LIFMIOR needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. \n\n• Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or \nany other cancer before you are given LIFMIOR. \nPatients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at \nhigher than average risk of developing lymphoma. \nChildren and adults taking LIFMIOR may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or \nanother cancer. \nSome children and teenage patients who have received LIFMIOR or other medicines that work \nthe same way as LIFMIOR have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes \nresulted in death. \nSome patients receiving LIFMIOR have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the \nchild develop any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. \n\n• Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using \nLIFMIOR. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. \n\n• Alcohol abuse: LIFMIOR should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol \nabuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse. \n\n• Wegener’s granulomatosis: LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, talk to your doctor. \n\n• Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking \nmedicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic \nmedicine while taking LIFMIOR. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n• Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \n\nLIFMIOR. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using \nLIFMIOR. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. \n\n• Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): There have been cases of IBD in patients with juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with LIFMIOR. Tell the doctor if the child develops any \nabdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool. \n\n \nLIFMIOR should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below \nthe age of 2 years, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis below the age of \n12 years, or in children with psoriasis below the age of 6 years. \n \nOther medicines and LIFMIOR \n \nTell the doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the doctor. \nYou or the child should not use LIFMIOR with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or \nabatacept. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n142 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nLIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if \nyou become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.  \n \nIf you received LIFMIOR during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. \nIn addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy, \ncompared with mothers who had not received LIFMIOR or other similar medicines \n(TNF-antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no \nincreased risk of birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy. Your doctor will \nhelp you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is \nimportant that you tell the baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of \nLIFMIOR during pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, \n“Vaccinations”). \n \nWomen using LIFMIOR should not breast-feed, since LIFMIOR passes into human breast milk.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThe use of LIFMIOR is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use LIFMIOR \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as the doctor has told you. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nIf you feel that the effect of LIFMIOR is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nDosing for adult patients (aged 18 years or over) \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. \nHowever, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject LIFMIOR.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg once a week.   \n \nAlternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 25 mg twice a week \nor 50 mg once a week.  \n \nYour doctor will decide how long you should take LIFMIOR and whether retreatment is needed based \non your response. If LIFMIOR has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell \nyou to stop taking this medicine. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nThe appropriate dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight \nand disease. The doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the \nappropriate dose. \n \nFor polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years, or enthesitis-related \narthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years, the usual dose is 0.4 mg of LIFMIOR \nper kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 25 mg) given twice weekly, or 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg \nbodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg) given once weekly. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n143 \n\n \nFor psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years, the usual dose is 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg \nbodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg), and should be given once weekly. If LIFMIOR has no effect \non the child’s condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nLIFMIOR is administered by an injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection). \n \nLIFMIOR can be taken with or without food or drink. \n \nThe powder must be dissolved before use. Detailed instructions on how to prepare and inject \nLIFMIOR are provided in section 7, “Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of \nLIFMIOR”. Do not mix the LIFMIOR solution with any other medicine. \n \nTo help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week LIFMIOR \nshould be used. \n \nIf you use more LIFMIOR than you should \n \nIf you have used more LIFMIOR than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or \nby using it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer carton \nof the medicine with you, even if it is empty. \n \nIf you forget to inject LIFMIOR \n \nIf you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is \nthe next day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on \nthe usual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a \ndouble dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using LIFMIOR  \n \nYour symptoms may return upon discontinuation.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nIf any of the following happen, do not inject more LIFMIOR. Tell your doctor immediately, or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital. \n \n• Trouble swallowing or breathing \n• Swelling of the face, throat, hands, or feet \n• Feeling nervous or anxious, throbbing sensations, sudden reddening of the skin and/or a warm \n\nfeeling \n• Severe rash, itching, or hives (elevated patches of red or pale skin that often itch) \n \nSerious allergic reactions are rare. However, any of the above symptoms may indicate an allergic \nreaction to LIFMIOR, so you should seek immediate medical attention. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n144 \n\nSerious side effects \n \nIf you notice any of the following, you or the child may need urgent medical attention. \n \n• Signs of serious infections, such as high fever that may be accompanied by cough, shortness of \n\nbreath, chills, weakness, or a hot, red, tender, sore area on the skin or joints \n• Signs of blood disorders, such as bleeding, bruising, or paleness \n• Signs of nerve disorders, such as numbness or tingling, changes in vision, eye pain, or onset of \n\nweakness in an arm or leg \n• Signs of heart failure or worsening heart failure, such as fatigue or shortness of breath with \n\nactivity, swelling in the ankles, a feeling of fullness in the neck or abdomen, night-time \nshortness of breath or coughing, bluish colour of the nails or the lips \n\n• Signs of cancers: Cancers may affect any part of the body including the skin and blood, and \npossible signs will depend on the type and location of the cancer.

How to store LIFMIOR  \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the label after “EXP”. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. \n \nBefore preparing the LIFMIOR solution, LIFMIOR may be stored outside of the refrigerator at \ntemperatures up to a maximum of 25°C for a single period of up to four weeks; after which, it should \nnot be refrigerated again. LIFMIOR should be discarded if not used within four weeks after removal \nfrom the refrigerator. It is recommended that you record the date that LIFMIOR is removed from the \nrefrigerator and the date after which LIFMIOR should be discarded (no more than 4 weeks following \nthe removal from the refrigerator). \n \nAfter preparing the LIFMIOR solution, immediate use is recommended. However, the solution may be \nused for up to 6 hours when stored at temperatures of up to 25°C.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice the solution is not clear or contains particles. The solution \nshould be clear, colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, with no lumps or flakes or particles. \n \nCarefully dispose of any LIFMIOR solution that has not been injected within 6 hours. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n146 \n\n \n \n6.

Preparing the injection site and injecting the LIFMIOR solution \ni. Disposing of supplies \n \na. Introduction \n \nThe following instructions explain how to prepare and inject LIFMIOR. Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. You will be instructed by your doctor or his/her assistant on \nthe techniques of self-injection or on giving an injection to a child. Do not attempt to administer an \ninjection until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection. \n \nThis injection should not be mixed with any other medicine. \n \nb. Setting up for an injection \n \n\n• Wash your hands thoroughly. \n• Select a clean well-lit, flat working surface. \n• The dose tray should contain the items listed below. (If not, don’t use the dose tray and \n\nconsult your pharmacist). Use only the items listed. Do NOT use any other syringe. \n1 LIFMIOR vial \n1 Pre-filled syringe containing clear, colourless solvent (water for injections) \n1 Needle \n1 Vial adaptor \n2 Alcohol swabs \n\n• Inspect the expiry dates on both the vial label and the syringe label. They should not be used \nafter the month and year shown. \n \n\nc. Preparing the LIFMIOR dose for injection \n \n• Remove the contents of the tray \n• Remove the plastic cap from the LIFMIOR vial (see Diagram 1). Do NOT remove the grey \n\nstopper or aluminium ring around the top of the vial. \n \n\nDiagram 1 \n\n \n \n• Use a new alcohol swab to clean the grey stopper on the LIFMIOR vial. After cleaning, do not \n\ntouch the stopper with your hands or allow it to touch any surface. \n• Place the vial upright on a clean, flat surface. \n• Remove the paper backing from the vial adaptor package. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n149 \n\n• While still in the plastic package, place the vial adaptor on top of the LIFMIOR vial so that the \nvial adaptor spike is centered within the raised circle on top of the vial stopper (see Diagram 2). \n\n• Hold the vial firmly on the flat surface with one hand. With the other hand, push STRAIGHT \nDOWN FIRMLY on the adaptor package until you feel the adaptor spike penetrate the vial \nstopper and FEEL AND HEAR THE ADAPTOR RIM LOCK INTO PLACE (see Diagram \n3). Do NOT push down the adaptor at an angle (see Diagram 4). It is important that the vial \nadaptor spike completely penetrates the vial stopper. \n\n \nDiagram 2. Diagram 3. Diagram 4. \n\n  \n\n \n CORRECT INCORRECT \n\n \n• While holding the vial in one hand, remove the plastic packaging from the vial adaptor (see \n\nDiagram 5). \nDiagram 5. \n\n \n \n\n• Remove the protective cover from the syringe tip by breaking the white cap along the \nperforation. This is done by holding the collar of the white cap while grasping the end of the \nwhite cap with the other hand and bending it down and then up until it is broken (see Diagram \n6). Do NOT remove the white collar that remains on the syringe. \n\n \nDiagram 6 \n\n \n \n• Do not use the syringe if this perforation is already broken. Start again with another dose tray. \n• Holding the glass barrel of the syringe (not the white collar) in one hand, and the vial adaptor \n\n(not the vial) in the other, connect the syringe to the vial adaptor by inserting the tip into the \nopening and turn clockwise until completely secured (see Diagram 7). \n\n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n150 \n\nDiagram 7 \n\n \n \n\nd. Adding solvent \n \n• While holding the vial upright on the flat surface, push the plunger VERY SLOWLY until all \n\nthe solvent is in the vial. This will help to reduce foaming (lots of bubbles) (see Diagram 8). \n• Once the solvent is added to the LIFMIOR, the plunger may move up by itself. This is due to air \n\npressure and should not be of concern. \n \n\nDiagram 8 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n• With the syringe still attached, gently move the vial in circles a few times, to dissolve the \npowder (see Diagram 9). Do NOT shake the vial. Wait until all the powder dissolves (usually \nless than 10 minutes). The solution should be clear and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, \nwith no lumps, flakes, or particles. Some white foam may remain in the vial  this is normal. Do \nNOT use LIFMIOR if all the powder in the vial is not dissolved within 10 minutes. Start again \nwith another dose tray. \n\n \nDiagram 9 \n\n \n \n\ne. Withdrawing the LIFMIOR solution from the vial \n \n• With the syringe still attached to the vial and vial adaptor, hold the vial upside down at eye \n\nlevel. Push the plunger all the way into the syringe (see Diagram 10). \n \n\nDiagram 10 \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n151 \n\n• Then, slowly pull the plunger back to draw the liquid into the syringe (see Diagram 11). For \nadult patients, withdraw the entire volume. For children, remove only the portion of liquid as \ndirected by your child’s doctor. After you have withdrawn the LIFMIOR from the vial, you may \nhave some air in the syringe. Do not be concerned, as you will remove the air in a later step. \n\n \nDiagram 11 \n\n \n \n• With the vial held upside down, unscrew the syringe from the vial adaptor by turning it \n\nanti-clockwise (see Diagram 12). \n \n\nDiagram 12 \n\n \n \n\n• Place the filled syringe on the clean, flat surface. Make sure that the tip does not touch anything. \nBe careful not to push down on the plunger. \n\n \n(Note: After you have completed these steps, a small amount of liquid may remain in the vial. This is \nnormal.) \n \nf. Placing the needle on the syringe \n \n• The needle has been placed in a plastic container to keep it sterile. \n• To open the plastic container, hold the short, wide end in one hand. Place your other hand on the \n\nlonger portion of the container. \n• To break the seal, bend the larger end down and then up until broken (see Diagram 13). \n\n \n\nDiagram 13 \n\n \n \n• Once the seal has been broken, remove the short, wide end of the plastic container. \n• The needle will remain in the long part of the package. \n• While holding the needle and container in one hand, pick up the syringe and insert the syringe \n\ntip into the needle opening. \n• Attach the syringe to the needle by turning it clockwise until completely secured (see Diagram \n\n14). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n152 \n\nDiagram 14 \n\n \n \n• Remove the needle cover by firmly pulling it straight off the syringe taking care not to touch \n\nthe needle or allow the needle to touch any surfaces (see Diagram 15). Be careful not to bend or \ntwist the cover during removal to avoid damage to the needle. \n\nDiagram 15 \n\n \n \n• While holding the syringe upright, remove any air bubbles by slowly pushing on the plunger \n\nuntil the air is removed (see Diagram 16). \n \n\nDiagram 16 \n\n \n \ng. Choosing an injection site \n \n• The three recommended injection sites for LIFMIOR include: (1) the front of the middle thighs; \n\n(2) the abdomen, except for the 5 cm area right around the navel; and (3) the outer area of the \nupper arms (see Diagram 17). If you are self injecting, you should not use the outer area of the \nupper arms. \n\n \nDiagram 17 \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n153 \n\n• A different site should be used for each new injection. Each new injection should be given at \nleast 3 cm from an old site. Do NOT inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or \nhard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the location of \nthe previous injections.) \n\n• If you or the child have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into any raised, thick, red, \nor scaly skin patches (“psoriasis skin lesions”). \n\n \nh. Preparing the injection site and injecting the LIFMIOR solution \n \n• Wipe the site where LIFMIOR is to be injected with an alcohol swab, using a circular motion. \n\nDo NOT touch this area again before giving the injection. \n• When the cleaned area of skin has dried, pinch and hold it firmly with one hand. With the other \n\nhand, hold the syringe like a pencil. \n• With a quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into the skin at an angle between 45° \n\nand 90° (see Diagram 18). With experience, you will find the angle that is most comfortable for \nyou or the child. Be careful not to push the needle into the skin too slowly, or with great force. \n\nDiagram 18 \n \n\n \n \n\n• When the needle is completely inserted into the skin, release the skin that you are holding. With \nyour free hand, hold the syringe near its base to stabilise it. Then push the plunger to inject all of \nthe solution at a slow, steady rate (see Diagram 19). \n\n \nDiagram 19 \n\n \n \n\n• When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from the skin; being careful to keep it at the same \nangle it was when it was inserted. \n\n• Press a cotton ball over the injection site for 10 seconds. Slight bleeding may occur. Do NOT \nrub the injection site. A bandage is optional. \n\n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n154 \n\ni.

Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR (See overleaf) \n \n \n1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for \n \nLIFMIOR is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein \nin the body that causes inflammation. LIFMIOR works by reducing the inflammation associated with \ncertain diseases. \n \nIn adults (aged 18 and over), LIFMIOR can be used for moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis, \npsoriatic arthritis, severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate \nor severe psoriasis – in each case usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well \nenough or are not suitable for you. \n \nFor rheumatoid arthritis, LIFMIOR is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may \nalso be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in \ncombination with methotrexate, LIFMIOR can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the \nrheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. \n \nFor psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, LIFMIOR can improve your ability to \ndo normal daily activities. For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., \nhands, wrists and feet), LIFMIOR can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the \ndisease.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n156 \n\nLIFMIOR is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents \n \n\n• For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not \nworked well enough or is not suitable for them: \n \n\n• Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \npatients from the age of 2 years \n \n\n• Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years \n \n\n• For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years when other widely used \ntreatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them \n \n\n• Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years who have had an inadequate response to (or \nare unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR  \n \nDo not use LIFMIOR \n \n• if you, or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients of \n\nLIFMIOR (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest \ntightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n• if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If \nyou are not sure, please contact your doctor. \n\n• if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. \n \nWarning and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking LIFMIOR. \n \n• Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, \n\nwheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. \n• Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major \n\nsurgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with LIFMIOR. \n• Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or \n\nsuffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. \n• Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If you \n\nor the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the presence of \ninfections after you or the child stop using LIFMIOR. \n\n• Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR, \nyour doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting LIFMIOR. This \nmay include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of \nthese tests should be recorded on the Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your \ndoctor if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with \nsomeone who has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, \nweight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell \nyour doctor immediately. \n\n• Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor \nshould test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with \nLIFMIOR. Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who \nhave previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using \nLIFMIOR. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n157 \n\n• Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to \nmonitor the treatment with LIFMIOR in case the infection worsens. \n\n• Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or \nsymptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms \nmay point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require \ndiscontinuation of LIFMIOR. \n\n• Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, \noptic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of \nthe spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if LIFMIOR is an appropriate treatment. \n\n• Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart \nfailure, because LIFMIOR needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. \n\n• Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or \nany other cancer before you are given LIFMIOR. \nPatients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at \nhigher than average risk of developing lymphoma. \nChildren and adults taking LIFMIOR may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or \nanother cancer. \nSome children and teenage patients who have received LIFMIOR or other medicines that work \nthe same way as LIFMIOR have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes \nresulted in death. \nSome patients receiving LIFMIOR have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the \nchild develop any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. \n\n• Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using \nLIFMIOR. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. \n\n• Latex: The needle cover is made from latex (dry natural rubber). Contact your doctor before \nusing LIFMIOR if the needle cover will be handled by, or LIFMIOR will be given to, someone \nwith a known or possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to latex. \n\n• Alcohol abuse: LIFMIOR should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol \nabuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse. \n\n• Wegener’s granulomatosis: LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, talk to your doctor. \n\n• Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking \nmedicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic \nmedicine while taking LIFMIOR. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents  \n \n• Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \n\nLIFMIOR. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using \nLIFMIOR. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. \n\n• Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): There have been cases of IBD in patients with juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with LIFMIOR. Tell the doctor if the child develops any \nabdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool. \n\n \nLIFMIOR should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below \nthe age of 2 years, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis below the age of \n12 years, or in children with psoriasis below the age of 6 years. \n \nOther medicines and LIFMIOR \n \nTell the doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the doctor. \nYou or the child should not use LIFMIOR with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or \nabatacept. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n158 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nLIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if \nyou become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. \n \nIf you received LIFMIOR during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. \nIn addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy, \ncompared with mothers who had not received LIFMIOR or other similar medicines \n(TNF-antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no \nincreased risk of birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy. Your doctor will \nhelp you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is \nimportant that you tell the baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of \nLIFMIOR during pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, \n“Vaccinations”). \n \nWomen using LIFMIOR should not breast-feed, since LIFMIOR passes into human breast milk.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThe use of LIFMIOR is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use LIFMIOR \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as the doctor has told you. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nIf you feel that the effect of LIFMIOR is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nThe pre-filled syringe is available in dose strengths of 25 mg and 50 mg.  \n \nDosing for adult patients (aged 18 years or over) \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. \nHowever, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject LIFMIOR.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg once a week.   \n \nAlternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 25 mg twice a week \nor 50 mg once a week.  \n \nYour doctor will decide how long you should take LIFMIOR and whether retreatment is needed based \non your response. If LIFMIOR has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell \nyou to stop taking this medicine. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nThe appropriate dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight \nand disease. Your doctor will determine the correct dose for the child and will prescribe an appropriate \nstrength of LIFMIOR (10 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n159 \n\nFor polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years, or enthesitis-related \narthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years, the usual dose is 0.4 mg of LIFMIOR \nper kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 25 mg) given twice weekly, or 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg of \nbodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg) given once weekly. \n \nFor psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years, the usual dose is 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg \nbodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg), and should be given once weekly. If LIFMIOR has no effect \non the child’s condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. \n \nThe doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the appropriate dose. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nLIFMIOR is administered by an injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection). \n \nLIFMIOR can be taken with or without food or drink. \n \nDetailed instructions on how to inject LIFMIOR are provided in section 7, “Instructions for \npreparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR”. Do not mix the LIFMIOR solution with any other \nmedicine. \n \nTo help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week LIFMIOR \nshould be used. \n \nIf you use more LIFMIOR than you should \n \nIf you have used more LIFMIOR than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or \nby using it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer carton \nof the medicine with you, even if it is empty. \n \nIf you forget to inject LIFMIOR \n \nIf you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is \nthe next day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on \nthe usual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a \ndouble dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using LIFMIOR  \n \nYour symptoms may return upon discontinuation.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nIf any of the following happen, do not inject more LIFMIOR. Tell your doctor immediately, or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital. \n \n• Trouble swallowing or breathing \n• Swelling of the face, throat, hands, or feet \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n160 \n\n• Feeling nervous or anxious, throbbing sensations, sudden reddening of the skin and/or a warm \nfeeling \n\n• Severe rash, itching, or hives (elevated patches of red or pale skin that often itch) \n \nSerious allergic reactions are rare.

Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR \n \nThis section is divided into the following subsections: \n \nIntroduction \nStep 1: Setting up for an injection \nStep 2: Choosing an injection site \nStep 3: Injecting the LIFMIOR solution \nStep 4: Disposing of supplies \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe following instructions explain how to prepare and inject LIFMIOR. Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. You will be instructed by your doctor or his/her assistant on \nthe techniques of self-injection or on giving an injection to a child. Do not attempt to administer an \ninjection until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection. \n \nThe LIFMIOR solution should not be mixed with any other medicine before use. \n \nStep 1: Setting up for an injection \n \n1. Select a clean, well-lit, flat working surface. \n\n2. Take the LIFMIOR carton containing the pre-filled syringes out of the refrigerator and place it on \nthe flat work surface. Starting from one of the top corners, pull back the paper cover from the top \nand sides of the tray. Remove one pre-filled syringe and one alcohol swab and place them on the \nwork surface. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe of LIFMIOR. Fold the paper cover back over the \ntray and place the carton containing any remaining pre-filled syringes back into the refrigerator. \nPlease see section 5 for instructions on how to store LIFMIOR. If you have any questions about \nstorage, contact your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist for further instructions. \n\n3. You should allow 15 to 30 minutes for the LIFMIOR solution in the syringe to reach room \ntemperature. Do NOT remove the needle cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. \nWaiting until the solution reaches room temperature may make the injection more comfortable for \nyou. Do not warm LIFMIOR in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in \nhot water). \n\n4. Assemble the additional supplies you will need for your injection. These include the alcohol swab \nfrom the LIFMIOR carton and a cotton ball or gauze. \n\n5. Wash your hands with soap and warm water. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n165 \n\n6. Inspect the solution in the syringe. It should be clear or slightly opalescent, colourless to pale \nyellow or pale brown, and may contain small white or almost transparent particles of protein. This \nappearance is normal for LIFMIOR. Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if \nparticles other than those described above are present. If you are concerned with the appearance of \nthe solution, then contact your pharmacist for assistance. \n\nStep 2: Choosing an injection site \n \n1. The three recommended injection sites for LIFMIOR using a pre-filled syringe include: (1) the \n\nfront of the middle thighs; (2) the abdomen, except for the 5 cm area right around the navel; and \n(3) the outer area of the upper arms (see Diagram 1). If you are self injecting, you should not use \nthe outer area of the upper arms. \n\nDiagram 1 \n\n \n2. A different site should be used for each new injection. Each new injection should be given at least \n\n3 cm from an old site. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. \nAvoid areas with scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the location of the \nprevious injections.) \n\n3. If you or the child have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or \nscaly skin patches (“psoriasis skin lesions”). \n\n \nStep 3: Injecting the LIFMIOR solution \n \n1. Wipe the site where LIFMIOR is to be injected with the alcohol swab, using a circular motion. Do \n\nNOT touch this area again before giving the injection. \n\n2. Pick up the pre-filled syringe from the flat work surface. Remove the needle cover by firmly \npulling it straight off the syringe (see Diagram 2). Be careful not to bend or twist the cover \nduring removal to avoid damage to the needle. \n\nWhen you remove the needle cover, there may be a drop of liquid at the end of the needle; this is \nnormal. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface. Do not touch or bump the \nplunger. Doing so could cause the liquid to leak out. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n166 \n\nDiagram 2 \n\n \n\n3. When the cleaned area of skin has dried, pinch and hold it firmly with one hand. With the other \nhand, hold the syringe like a pencil. \n\n4. With a quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into the skin at an angle between 45° and \n90° (see Diagram 3). With experience, you will find the angle that is most comfortable for you or \nthe child. Be careful not to push the needle into the skin too slowly, or with great force.  \n\n \nDiagram 3 \n\n \n\n \n5. When the needle is completely inserted into the skin, release the skin that you are holding. With \n\nyour free hand, hold the syringe near its base to stabilise it. Then push the plunger to inject all of \nthe solution at a slow, steady rate (see Diagram 4). \n\nDiagram 4 \n\n \n \n\n6 When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin, being careful to keep it at the same \nangle as inserted. There may be a little bleeding at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball \nor gauze over the injection site for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. If needed, you may \ncover the injection site with a bandage. \n\nStep 4: Disposing of supplies \n \n• The pre-filled syringe is for single-use administration only. The syringe and needle should \n\nNEVER be re-used. NEVER re-cap a needle. Dispose of the needle and syringe as instructed by \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n167 \n\nIf you have any questions, please talk to a doctor, nurse or pharmacist who is familiar with \nLIFMIOR. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n168 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the User \n \n\nLIFMIOR 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nEtanercept \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR \n3. How to use LIFMIOR \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store LIFMIOR \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Using the MYCLIC pre-filled pen to inject LIFMIOR (See overleaf) \n \n \n1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for \n \nLIFMIOR is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein \nin the body that causes inflammation. LIFMIOR works by reducing the inflammation associated with \ncertain diseases. \n \nIn adults (aged 18 and over), LIFMIOR can be used for moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis, \npsoriatic arthritis, severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate \nor severe psoriasis – in each case usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well \nenough or are not suitable for you. \n \nFor rheumatoid arthritis, LIFMIOR is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may \nalso be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in \ncombination with methotrexate, LIFMIOR can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the \nrheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. \n \nFor psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, LIFMIOR can improve your ability to \ndo normal daily activities. For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., \nhands, wrists and feet), LIFMIOR can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the \ndisease.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n169 \n\nLIFMIOR is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents \n \n\n• For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not \nworked well enough or is not suitable for them: \n \n\n• Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \npatients from the age of 2 years \n \n\n• Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years \n \n\n• For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years when other widely used \ntreatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them \n \n\n• Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years who have had an inadequate response to \n(or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR  \n \nDo not use LIFMIOR \n \n• if you, or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients of \n\nLIFMIOR (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest \ntightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n• if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If \nyou are not sure, please contact your doctor. \n\n• if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking LIFMIOR. \n \n• Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, \n\nwheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. \n• Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major \n\nsurgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with LIFMIOR. \n• Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or \n\nsuffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. \n• Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If you \n\nor the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the presence of \ninfections after you or the child stop using LIFMIOR. \n\n• Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR, \nyour doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting LIFMIOR. This \nmay include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of \nthese tests should be recorded on the Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your \ndoctor if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with \nsomeone who has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, \nweight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell \nyour doctor immediately. \n\n• Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor \nshould test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with \nLIFMIOR. Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who \nhave previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using \nLIFMIOR. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n170 \n\n• Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to \nmonitor the treatment with LIFMIOR in case the infection worsens. \n\n• Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or \nsymptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms \nmay point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require \ndiscontinuation of LIFMIOR. \n\n• Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, \noptic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of \nthe spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if LIFMIOR is an appropriate treatment. \n\n• Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart \nfailure, because LIFMIOR needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. \n\n• Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or \nany other cancer before you are given LIFMIOR. \nPatients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at \nhigher than average risk of developing lymphoma. \nChildren and adults taking LIFMIOR may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or \nanother cancer. \nSome children and teenage patients who have received LIFMIOR or other medicines that work \nthe same way as LIFMIOR have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes \nresulted in death. \nSome patients receiving LIFMIOR have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the \nchild develop any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. \n\n• Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using \nLIFMIOR. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. \n\n• Latex: The needle cap of the MYCLIC pen is made from latex (dry natural rubber). Contact \nyour doctor before using LIFMIOR if the needle cap will be handled by, or LIFMIOR will be \ngiven to, someone with a known or possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to latex. \n\n• Alcohol abuse: LIFMIOR should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol \nabuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse. \n\n• Wegener’s granulomatosis: LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, talk to your doctor. \n\n• Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking \nmedicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic \nmedicine while taking LIFMIOR. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents  \n \n• Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \n\nLIFMIOR. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using \nLIFMIOR. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. \n\n• Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): There have been cases of IBD in patients with juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with LIFMIOR. Tell the doctor if the child develops any \nabdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool. \n\n \nLIFMIOR should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below \nthe age of 2 years, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis below the age of \n12 years, or in children with psoriasis below the age of 6 years. \n \nOther medicines and LIFMIOR \n \nTell the doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the doctor. \nYou or the child should not use LIFMIOR with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or \nabatacept. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n171 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nLIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if \nyou become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. \n \nIf you received LIFMIOR during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. \nIn addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy, \ncompared with mothers who had not received LIFMIOR or other similar medicines \n(TNF-antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no \nincreased risk of birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy. Your doctor will \nhelp you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is \nimportant that you tell the baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of \nLIFMIOR during pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, \n“Vaccinations”). \n \nWomen using LIFMIOR should not breast-feed, since LIFMIOR passes into human breast milk.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThe use of LIFMIOR is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use LIFMIOR \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if or pharmacist \nyou are not sure. \n \nIf you feel that the effect of LIFMIOR is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nYou have been prescribed a 50 mg strength of LIFMIOR. A 25 mg strength of LIFMIOR is available \nfor doses of 25 mg.  \n \nDosing for adult patients (aged 18 years or over) \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. \nHowever, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject LIFMIOR.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg once a week.   \n \nAlternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 25 mg twice a week \nor 50 mg once a week.  \n \nYour doctor will decide how long you should take LIFMIOR and whether retreatment is needed based \non your response. If LIFMIOR has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell \nyou to stop taking this medicine. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nThe appropriate dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight \nand disease. Your doctor will determine the correct dose for the child and will prescribe an appropriate \nstrength of LIFMIOR (10 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n172 \n\nFor polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years, or enthesitis-related \narthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years, the usual dose is 0.4 mg of LIFMIOR \nper kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 25 mg) given twice weekly, or 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg of \nbodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg) given once weekly. \n \nFor psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years, the usual dose is 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg \nbodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg), and should be given once weekly. If LIFMIOR has no effect \non the child’s condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. \n \nThe doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the appropriate dose. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nLIFMIOR is administered by an injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection). \n \nLIFMIOR can be taken with or without food or drink. \n \nDetailed instructions on how to inject LIFMIOR are provided in section 7, “Using the MYCLIC \npre-filled pen to inject LIFMIOR”. Do not mix the LIFMIOR solution with any other medicine. \n \nTo help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week LIFMIOR \nshould be used. \n \nIf you use more LIFMIOR than you should \n \nIf you have used more LIFMIOR than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or \nby using it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer carton \nof the medicine with you, even if it is empty. \n \nIf you forget to inject LIFMIOR \n \nIf you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is \nthe next day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on \nthe usual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a \ndouble dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using LIFMIOR  \n \nYour symptoms may return upon discontinuation.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nIf any of the following happen, do not inject more LIFMIOR. Tell your doctor immediately, or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital. \n \n• Trouble swallowing or breathing \n• Swelling of the face, throat, hands, or feet \n• Feeling nervous or anxious, throbbing sensations, sudden reddening of the skin and/or a warm \n\nfeeling \n• Severe rash, itching, or hives (elevated patches of red or pale skin that often itch) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n173 \n\n \nSerious allergic reactions are rare.

How to store LIFMIOR \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the MYCLIC \npre-filled pen after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2° – 8°C). Do not freeze. \nKeep the pre-filled pens in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nAfter taking a pre-filled pen from the refrigerator, wait approximately 15-30 minutes to allow the \nLIFMIOR solution in the pen to reach room temperature.  Do not warm in any other way. \nImmediate use is then recommended.   \n \nLIFMIOR may be stored outside of the refrigerator at temperatures up to a maximum of 25°C for a \nsingle period of up to four weeks; after which, it should not be refrigerated again. LIFMIOR should be \ndiscarded if not used within four weeks after removal from the refrigerator. It is recommended that \nyou record the date that LIFMIOR is removed from the refrigerator and the date after which LIFMIOR \nshould be discarded (no more than 4 weeks following the removal from the refrigerator). \n \nInspect the solution in the pen by looking through the clear inspection window. The solution should be \nclear or slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, and may contain small white or \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n175 \n\nalmost transparent particles of protein. This appearance is normal for LIFMIOR. Do not use the \nsolution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles other than those described above are present. If you \nare concerned with the appearance of the solution, then contact your pharmacist for assistance. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Using the MYCLIC pre-filled pen to inject LIFMIOR \n \nThis section is divided into the following subsections: \n \nIntroduction \nStep 1: Preparing for an LIFMIOR injection \nStep 2: Choosing an injection site \nStep 3: Injecting the LIFMIOR solution \nStep 4: Disposing of the used MYCLIC pen \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe instructions below explain how to use the MYCLIC pen to inject LIFMIOR. Please read the \ninstructions carefully, and follow them step by step. Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to inject \nLIFMIOR. Do not attempt to administer an injection until you are sure that you understand how to use \nthe MYCLIC pen properly. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor or nurse \nfor help. \n \n\nDiagram 1 \n \n\nThe MYCLIC pre-filled pen \n    \n\n \n\n \n \n \nStep 1: Preparing for an LIFMIOR injection \n \n1. Select a clean, well-lit, flat surface. \n\n2. Gather the items that you will need for your injection, and place them on the chosen surface: \n\na. One MYCLIC pre-filled pen and one alcohol swab (take these from the carton of pens \nyou keep in your refrigerator). Do not shake the pen. \n\nb. One cotton ball or gauze  \n\n3. Check the expiry date (month/year) on the pen. If the date has passed, do not use the pen and \ncontact your pharmacist for assistance. \n\n4. Inspect the solution in the pen by looking through the clear inspection window. The solution \nshould be clear or slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, and may contain \nsmall white or almost transparent particles of protein. This appearance is normal for LIFMIOR. \nDo not use the solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles other than those described above \nare present. If you are concerned with the appearance of the solution, then contact your pharmacist \nfor assistance. \n\nExpiry date \n\nWhite needle cap \n\nClear inspection window \n\nGreen activation button \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n178 \n\n5. Leave the white needle cap in place and wait approximately 15-30 minutes to allow the \nLIFMIOR solution in the pen to reach room temperature. Waiting until the solution reaches room \ntemperature may make the injection more comfortable for you. Do not warm in any other way. \nAlways leave the pen out of sight and reach of children.  \n\nWhilst waiting for the solution in the pen to reach room temperature, read Step 2 (below), and choose \nan injection site.  \n \nStep 2: Choosing an injection site (see Diagram 2) \n \n1. The recommended injection site is the middle of the front of the thighs. If you prefer, you may \n\nalternatively use the stomach area, but make sure you choose a site at least 5 cm away from the \nbelly button (navel). If someone else is giving you the injection, the outer area of the upper arms \nmay also be used. \n\n \nDiagram 2 \n\n \n2. Each injection should be given at least 3 cm from where you last injected. Do not inject into \n\ntender, bruised or hard skin. Avoid scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the \nlocation of the previous injections.) \n\n3. If you have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin. \n \nStep 3: Injecting the LIFMIOR solution \n \n1. After waiting approximately 15-30 minutes for the solution in the pen to warm to room \n\ntemperature, wash your hands with soap and water. \n\n2. Clean the injection site with the alcohol swab using a circular motion, and allow it to dry. Do not \ntouch this area again before injecting. \n\n3. Pick up the pen, and remove the white needle cap by pulling it straight off (see Diagram 3). To avoid \ndamaging the needle inside the pen, do not bend the white needle cap while you are removing it, and \ndo not re-attach it once it has been removed. After removal of the needle cap, you will see a purple \nneedle safety shield extending slightly from the end of the pen. The needle will remain protected \ninside the pen until the pen is activated. Do not use the pen if it is dropped with the needle cap off. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n179 \n\nDiagram 3 \n \n\nWhite needle cap \n \n\n \nPurple needle safety shield  \n\n \n4.

Hold the pen at a right angle (90º) to the injection site. Push the open end of the pen firmly against \nthe skin, so that the needle safety shield is pushed completely inside of the pen. A slight depression \nin the skin will be seen (see Diagram 4). The pen can only be activated when the needle shield is \ncompletely pushed inside the pen. \n\nDiagram 4 \n \n\n \nNeedle safety shield  \ndisappears inside the pen \n\n \n6. Whilst pushing the pen firmly against the skin to ensure that the needle safety shield is fully \n\ndepressed inside the pen, press the centre of the green button on top of the pen with your thumb \nto start the injection (see Diagram 5). On pressing the centre of the button, you will hear a click. \nContinue to hold the pen firmly against your skin until you hear a second click, or until \n10 seconds after the first click (whichever happens first).  \n \nNote – If you are unable to start the injection as described, press the pen more firmly against your \nskin, then press the green button again. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n180 \n\nDiagram 5 \n \n\n \n\n7.

Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR (See overleaf) \n \n \n1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for \n \nLIFMIOR is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein \nin the body that causes inflammation. LIFMIOR works by reducing the inflammation associated with \ncertain diseases. \n \nLIFMIOR is prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents \n \n\n• For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not \nworked well enough or is not suitable for them: \n \n\n• Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \npatients from the age of 2 years \n \n\n• Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years \n \n\n• For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years when other widely used \ntreatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them \n \n\n• Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years who have had an inadequate response to (or \nare unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies. \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n183 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR  \n \nDo not use LIFMIOR \n \n\n• if the child you are caring for is allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients of \nLIFMIOR (listed in section 6). If the child experiences allergic reactions such as chest \ntightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n• if the child has, or is at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If you are \nnot sure, please contact your doctor. \n\n• if the child has an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking LIFMIOR. \n \n• Allergic reactions: If the child experiences allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, \n\ndizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. \n• Infections/surgery: If the child develops a new infection, or is about to have any major surgery, \n\nthe doctor may wish to monitor the child's treatment with LIFMIOR. \n• Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if the child has a history of recurrent infections, or suffers \n\nfrom diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. \n• Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If the \n\nchild develops symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor the child for the presence of \ninfections after the child stops using LIFMIOR. \n\n• Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR, \nyour doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting LIFMIOR. This \nmay include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of \nthese tests should be recorded on the Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your \ndoctor if the child has ever had tuberculosis, or has been in close contact with someone who has \nhad tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, \nlistlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n• Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if the child has or has ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor should \ntest for the presence of hepatitis B infection before the child begins treatment with LIFMIOR. \nTreatment with LIFMIOR may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have \npreviously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using \nLIFMIOR. \n\n• Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if the child has hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to monitor the \ntreatment with LIFMIOR in case the infection worsens. \n\n• Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if the child has any signs or symptoms such \nas persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms may point to the \nexistence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require discontinuation of \nLIFMIOR. \n\n• Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if the child has multiple sclerosis, optic \nneuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of the \nspinal cord). Your doctor will determine if LIFMIOR is an appropriate treatment. \n\n• Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if the child has a history of congestive heart failure, \nbecause LIFMIOR needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. \n\n• Cancer: Tell your doctor if the child has or has ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or \nany other cancer before the child is given LIFMIOR. \nPatients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at \nhigher than average risk of developing lymphoma. \nChildren and adults taking LIFMIOR may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or \nanother cancer. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n184 \n\nSome children and teenage patients who have received LIFMIOR or other medicines that work \nthe same way as LIFMIOR have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes \nresulted in death. \nSome patients receiving LIFMIOR have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if the child \ndevelops any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. \n\n• Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if the child is exposed to chickenpox when using LIFMIOR. \nYour doctor will determine if preventative treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. \n\n• Alcohol abuse: LIFMIOR should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol \nabuse. Please tell your doctor if the child in your care has a history of alcohol abuse. \n\n• Wegener’s granulomatosis: LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If the child in your care has Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, talk to your doctor. \n\n• Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if the child has diabetes or is taking medicines to \ntreat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if the child needs less anti-diabetic medicine while \ntaking LIFMIOR. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents  \n \n• Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \n\nLIFMIOR. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using \nLIFMIOR. Please consult the child’s doctor before the child receives any vaccines. \n\n• Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): There have been cases of IBD in patients with juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with LIFMIOR. Tell the doctor if the child develops any \nabdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool. \n\n \nLIFMIOR should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below \nthe age of 2 years, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis below the age of \n12 years, or in children with psoriasis below the age of 6 years. \n \nOther medicines and LIFMIOR \n \nTell the doctor or pharmacist if the child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the child's \ndoctor. The child should not use LIFMIOR with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra \nor abatacept. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nLIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if \nyou become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.  \n \nIf you received LIFMIOR during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. \nIn addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy, \ncompared with mothers who had not received LIFMIOR or other similar medicines \n(TNF-antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no \nincreased risk of birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy. Your doctor will \nhelp you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is \nimportant that you tell the baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of \nLIFMIOR during pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, \n“Vaccinations”). \n \nWomen using LIFMIOR should not breast-feed, since LIFMIOR passes into human breast milk.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThe use of LIFMIOR is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n185 \n\n \n3. How to use LIFMIOR \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as the doctor has told you. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nIf you feel that the effect of LIFMIOR is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nThe appropriate dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight \nand disease. The doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the \nappropriate dose. \n \nThe 10 mg vial is for children prescribed a dose of 10 mg or less. Each vial should be used for just one \ndose in one patient, and any remaining solution should be discarded. \n \nFor polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years, or enthesitis-related \narthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years, the usual dose is 0.4 mg of LIFMIOR \nper kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 25 mg) given twice weekly, or 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg of \nbodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg) given once weekly. \n \nFor psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years, the usual dose is 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg \nbodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg), and should be given once weekly. If LIFMIOR has no effect \non the child’s condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nLIFMIOR is administered by an injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection). \n \nLIFMIOR can be taken with or without food or drink. \n \nThe powder must be dissolved before use. Detailed instructions on how to prepare and inject \nLIFMIOR are provided in section 7, “Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of \nLIFMIOR”. Do not mix the LIFMIOR solution with any other medicine. \n \nTo help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week LIFMIOR \nshould be used. \n \nIf you use more LIFMIOR than you should \n \nIf you have used more LIFMIOR than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or \nby using it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer carton \nof the medicine with you, even if it is empty. \n \nIf you forget to inject LIFMIOR \n \nIf you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is \nthe next day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on \nthe usual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a \ndouble dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. \n M\ned\n\nicin\nal \n\npro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n186 \n\nIf you stop using LIFMIOR  \n \nYour symptoms may return upon discontinuation.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nIf any of the following happen to the child, do not give the child more LIFMIOR. Tell your doctor \nimmediately, or go to the casualty department at your nearest hospital. \n \n• Trouble swallowing or breathing \n• Swelling of the face, throat, hands, or feet \n• Feeling nervous or anxious, throbbing sensations, sudden reddening of the skin and/or a warm \n\nfeeling \n• Severe rash, itching, or hives (elevated patches of red or pale skin that often itch) \n \nSerious allergic reactions are rare. If the child has any of the above symptoms he/she may be having \nan allergic reaction to LIFMIOR, so you should seek immediate medical attention.  \n \nSerious side effects \n \nIf you notice any of the following, the child may need urgent medical attention. \n• Signs of serious infections, such as high fever that may be accompanied by cough, shortness of \n\nbreath, chills, weakness, or a hot, red, tender, sore area on the skin or joints \n• Signs of blood disorders, such as bleeding, bruising, or paleness \n• Signs of nerve disorders, such as numbness or tingling, changes in vision, eye pain, or onset of \n\nweakness in an arm or leg \n• Signs of heart failure or worsening heart failure, such as fatigue or shortness of breath with \n\nactivity, swelling in the ankles, a feeling of fullness in the neck or abdomen, night-time \nshortness of breath or coughing, bluish colour of the nails or the lips \n\n• Signs of cancers: Cancers may affect any part of the body including the skin and blood, and \npossible signs will depend on the type and location of the cancer. These signs may include \nweight loss, fever, swelling (with or without pain), persistent cough, presence of lumps or \ngrowths on the skin \n\n• Signs of autoimmune reactions (where antibodies are made that may harm normal tissues in \nthe body) such as pain, itching, weakness, and abnormal breathing, thinking, sensation, or vision \n\n• Signs of lupus or lupus-like syndrome, such as weight changes, persistent rash, fever, joint or \nmuscle pain, or fatigue \n\n• Signs of inflammation of the blood vessels such as pain, fever, redness or warmth of the skin, \nor itching. \n\n \nThese are rare or uncommon side effects, but are serious conditions (some of which may rarely be \nfatal). If these signs occur, tell your doctor immediately, or take the child to the casualty department at \nyour nearest hospital. \n \nThe known side effects of LIFMIOR include the following in groups of decreasing frequency: \n \n• Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\nInfections (including colds, sinusitis, bronchitis, urinary tract infections and skin infections); \ninjection site reactions (including bleeding, bruising, redness, itching, pain, and swelling). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n187 \n\nReactions at the injection site (these do not occur as often after the first month of treatment). \nSome patients have developed a reaction at an injection site that was used before. \n\n \n• Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\nAllergic reactions; fever; rash; itching; antibodies directed against normal tissue (autoantibody \nformation). \n\n \n• Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\nSerious infections (including pneumonia, deep skin infections, joint infections, blood infection, \nand infections at various sites); worsening of congestive heart failure; low red blood cell count, \nlow white blood cell count, low neutrophil (a type of white blood cell) count; low blood platelet \ncount; skin cancer (excluding melanoma); localised swelling of the skin (angioedema); hives \n(elevated patches of red or pale skin that often itch); eye inflammation; psoriasis (new or \nworsening); inflammation of the blood vessels affecting multiple organs; elevated liver blood \ntests (in patients also receiving methotrexate treatment, the frequency of elevated liver blood \ntests is common). \n\n \n• Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\nSerious allergic reactions (including severe localised swelling of the skin and wheezing); \nlymphoma (a type of blood cancer); leukaemia (cancer affecting the blood and bone marrow); \nmelanoma (a type of skin cancer); combined low platelet, red, and white blood cell count; \nnervous system disorders (with severe muscle weakness and signs and symptoms similar to \nthose of multiple sclerosis or inflammation of the nerves of the eyes or spinal cord); \ntuberculosis; new onset congestive heart failure; seizures; lupus or lupus-like syndrome \n(symptoms may include persistent rash, fever, joint pain, and tiredness); skin rash, which may \nlead to severe blistering and peeling of the skin; lichenoid reactions (itchy reddish-purple skin \nrash and/or threadlike white-grey lines on mucous membranes); inflammation of the liver \ncaused by the body's own immune system (autoimmune hepatitis; in patients also receiving \nmethotrexate treatment, the frequency is uncommon); immune disorder that can affect the \nlungs, skin and lymph nodes (sarcoidosis); inflammation or scarring of the lungs (in patients \nalso receiving methotrexate treatment, the frequency of inflammation or scarring of the lungs is \nuncommon). \n\n \n• Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): failure of the bone marrow to produce crucial \n\nblood cells. \n \n• Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): Merkel cell carcinoma (a \n\ntype of skin cancer); excessive activation of white blood cells associated with inflammation \n(macrophage activation syndrome); recurrence of hepatitis B (a liver infection); worsening of a \ncondition called dermatomyositis (muscle inflammation and weakness with an accompanying \nskin rash). \n\n \nSide effects in children and adolescents \n \nThe side effects and their frequencies seen in children and adolescents are similar to those described \nabove. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. You will be instructed by the child's doctor or his/her assistant \non the technique of giving an injection and on the amount to be given to the child. Do not attempt to \nadminister an injection until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n191 \n\nThis injection should not be mixed in the same syringe or vial with any other medicine. See section 5 \nfor instructions on how to store LIFMIOR. \n \nb. Setting up for an injection \n \n• Wash your hands thoroughly. \n• Select a clean well-lit, flat working surface. \n• The dose tray should contain the items listed below. (If not, don’t use the dose tray and consult \n\nyour pharmacist). Use only the items listed. Do NOT use any other syringe. \n1 LIFMIOR vial \n1 Pre-filled syringe containing clear, colourless solvent (water for injections) \n1 Needle \n1 Vial adaptor \n2 Alcohol swabs \n\n• Inspect the expiry dates on both the vial label and the syringe label. They should not be used \nafter the month and year shown. \n\n \nc. Preparing the LIFMIOR dose for injection \n \n• Remove the contents of the tray \n• Remove the plastic cap from the LIFMIOR vial (see Diagram 1). Do NOT remove the grey \n\nstopper or aluminium ring around the top of the vial. \n \n\nDiagram 1 \n\n \n \n• Use a new alcohol swab to clean the grey stopper on the LIFMIOR vial. After cleaning, do not \n\ntouch the stopper with your hands or allow it to touch any surface. \n• Place the vial upright on a clean, flat surface. \n• Remove the paper backing from the vial adaptor package. \n• While still in the plastic package, place the vial adaptor on top of the LIFMIOR vial so that the \n\nvial adaptor spike is centered within the raised circle on top of the vial stopper (see Diagram 2). \n• Hold the vial firmly on the flat surface with one hand. With the other hand, push STRAIGHT \n\nDOWN FIRMLY on the adaptor package until you feel the adaptor spike penetrate the vial \nstopper and FEEL AND HEAR THE ADAPTOR RIM LOCK INTO PLACE (see Diagram \n3). Do NOT push down the adaptor at an angle (see Diagram 4). It is important that the vial \nadaptor spike completely penetrates the vial stopper. \n\n \nDiagram 2 Diagram 3 Diagram 4 \n\n  \n\n \n CORRECT INCORRECT \n\n \n• While holding the vial in one hand, remove the plastic packaging from the vial adaptor (see \n\nDiagram 5). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n192 \n\n \n\nDiagram 5 \n\n \n \n\n• Remove the protective cover from the syringe tip by breaking the white cap along the \nperforation. This is done by holding the collar of the white cap while grasping the end of the \nwhite cap with the other hand and bending it down and then up until it is broken (see Diagram \n6). Do NOT remove the white collar that remains on the syringe. \n\n \nDiagram 6 \n\n \n \n• Do not use the syringe if the perforation between the tip and collar is already broken. Start again \n\nwith another dose tray. \n• Holding the glass barrel of the syringe (not the white collar) in one hand, and the vial adaptor \n\n(not the vial) in the other, connect the syringe to the vial adaptor by inserting the tip into the \nopening and turn clockwise until completely secured (see Diagram 7). \n\n \nDiagram 7 \n\n \nd. Adding solvent \n \n• While holding the vial upright on the flat surface, push the plunger VERY SLOWLY until all \n\nthe solvent is in the vial. This will help to reduce foaming (lots of bubbles) (see Diagram 8). \n• Once the solvent is added to the LIFMIOR, the plunger may move up by itself. This is due to air \n\npressure and should not be of concern. \n \n\nDiagram 8 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n193 \n\n• With the syringe still attached, gently move the vial in circles a few times, to dissolve the \npowder (see Diagram 9). Do NOT shake the vial. Wait until all the powder dissolves (usually \nless than 10 minutes). The solution should be clear and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, \nwith no lumps, flakes, or particles. Some white foam may remain in the vial  this is normal. Do \nNOT use LIFMIOR if all the powder in the vial is not dissolved within 10 minutes. Start again \nwith another dose tray. \n\n \nDiagram 9 \n\n \n \n\ne. Withdrawing the LIFMIOR solution from the vial \n \n• The doctor or his/her assistant should have instructed you on the proper amount of solution to be \n\nwithdrawn from the vial. If the doctor has not given this instruction, please contact him/her. \n• With the syringe still attached to the vial and vial adaptor, hold the vial upside down at eye \n\nlevel. Push the plunger all the way into the syringe (see Diagram 10). \n \n\nDiagram 10 \n\n \n \n• Then, slowly pull the plunger back to draw the liquid into the syringe (see Diagram 11). \n\nRemove only the portion of liquid as directed by your child’s doctor. After you have withdrawn \nthe LIFMIOR from the vial, you may have some air in the syringe. Do not be concerned, as you \nwill remove the air in a later step. \n\n \nDiagram 11 \n\n \n \n• With the vial held upside down, unscrew the syringe from the vial adaptor by turning it \n\nanti-clockwise (see Diagram 12). \n Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n194 \n\nDiagram 12 \n\n \n \n• Place the filled syringe on the clean, flat surface. Make sure that the tip does not touch anything. \n\nBe careful not to push down on the plunger. \n \nf. Placing the needle on the syringe \n \n• The needle has been placed in a plastic container to keep it sterile. \n• To open the plastic container, hold the short, wide end in one hand. Place your other hand on the \n\nlonger portion of the container. \n• To break the seal, bend the larger end down and then up until broken (see Diagram 13). \n\n \n\nDiagram 13 \n\n \n• Once the seal has been broken, remove the short, wide end of the plastic container. \n• The needle will remain in the long part of the package. \n• While holding the needle and container in one hand, pick up the syringe and insert the syringe \n\ntip into the needle opening. \n• Attach the syringe to the needle by turning it clockwise until completely secured (see Diagram \n\n14). \n \n\nDiagram 14 \n\n \n \n• Remove the needle cover by firmly pulling it straight off the syringe taking care not to touch \n\nthe needle or allow the needle to touch any surfaces (see Diagram 15). Be careful not to bend or \ntwist the cover during removal to avoid damage to the needle. \n\n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n195 \n\nDiagram 15 \n\n \n \n• While holding the syringe upright, remove any air bubbles by slowly pushing on the plunger \n\nuntil the air is removed (see Diagram 16). \n \n\nDiagram 16 \n\n \n \ng. Choosing an injection site \n \n• The three recommended injection sites for LIFMIOR include: (1) the front of the middle thighs; \n\n(2) the abdomen, except for the 5 cm area right around the navel; and (3) the outer area of the \nupper arms (see Diagram 17). If you are self injecting, you should not use the outer area of the \nupper arms. \n\n \nDiagram 17 \n\n \n• A different site should be used for each new injection. Each new injection should be given at \n\nleast 3 cm from an old site. Do NOT inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or \nhard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the location of \nthe previous injections.) \n\n• If the child has psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly \nskin patches (“psoriasis skin lesions”). \n\n \nh. Preparing the injection site and injecting the LIFMIOR solution \n \n• Wipe the site where LIFMIOR is to be injected with a new alcohol swab, using a circular \n\nmotion. Do NOT touch this area again before giving the injection. \n• When the cleaned area of skin has dried, pinch and hold it firmly with one hand. With the other \n\nhand, hold the syringe like a pencil. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n196 \n\n• With a quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into the skin at an angle between 45° \nand 90° (see Diagram 18). With experience, you will find the angle that is most comfortable for \nthe child. Be careful not to push the needle into the skin too slowly, or with great force. \n\n \nDiagram 18 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n• When the needle is completely inserted into the skin, release the skin that you are holding. With \nyour free hand, hold the syringe near its base to stabilise it. Then push the plunger to inject all of \nthe solution at a slow, steady rate (see Diagram 19). \n\n \nDiagram 19 \n\n \n \n\n• When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from the skin; being careful to keep it at the same \nangle it was when it was inserted. \n\n• Press a cotton ball over the injection site for 10 seconds. Slight bleeding may occur. Do NOT \nrub the injection site. A bandage is optional. \n\n \ni. Disposing of supplies \n \n• The syringe and needles should NEVER be re-used. Dispose of the needles and syringe as \n\ninstructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nIf you have any questions, please talk to a doctor, nurse or pharmacist who is familiar with \nLIFMIOR. \n \n \n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
