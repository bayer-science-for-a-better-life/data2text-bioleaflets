CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \n\nDaptomycin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n\n- Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and soft-tissue infections \n\n(cSSTI). \n\n- Adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus. It is \nrecommended that the decision to use daptomycin should take into account the antibacterial \n\nsusceptibility of the organism and should be based on expert advice (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n\n- Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB). \n\nIn adults, use in bacteraemia should be associated with RIE or with cSSTI, while in paediatric \n\npatients, use in bacteraemia should be associated with cSSTI.  \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nDaptomycin is active against Gram positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed infections where \n\nGram negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are suspected, daptomycin should be \n\nco-administered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s).  \n \n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n\n \nClinical studies in patients employed infusion of daptomycin over at least 30 minutes. There is no clinical \n\nexperience in patients with the administration of daptomycin as an injection over 2 minutes. This mode of \n\nadministration was only studied in healthy subjects. However, when compared with the same doses given \n\nas intravenous infusions over 30 minutes there were no clinically important differences in the \n\npharmacokinetics and safety profile of daptomycin (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nAdults \n\n- cSSTI without concurrent SAB: daptomycin 4 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours for \n\n7-14 days or until the infection is resolved (see section 5.1).  \n- cSSTI with concurrent SAB: daptomycin 6 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours. See below \n\nfor dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment. The duration of therapy may need to be \n\nlonger than 14 days in accordance with the perceived risk of complications in the individual patient.  \n\n- Known or suspected RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus: daptomycin 6 mg/kg is administered once \n\nevery 24 hours. See below for dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment. The duration of \ntherapy should be in accordance with available official recommendations.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin is administered intravenously in 0.9 % sodium chloride (see section 6.6). Daptomycin should \n\nnot be used more frequently than once a day.  \n\n \nCreatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels must be measured at baseline and at regular intervals (at least \n\nweekly) during treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\nDaptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidney.  \n\n \nDue to limited clinical experience (see table and footnotes below) daptomycin should only be used in adult \n\npatients with any degree of renal impairment (CrCl < 80 ml/min) when it is considered that the expected \n\nclinical benefit outweighs the potential risk. The response to treatment, renal function and creatine \n\nphosphokinase (CPK) levels should be closely monitored in all patients with any degree of renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). The dosage regimen for daptomycin in paediatric patients with \nrenal impairment has not been established. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nDose adjustments in adult patients with renal impairment by indication and creatinine clearance \n\n  \nIndication for use Creatinine clearance Dose recommendation Comments \n\ncSSTI without SAB  \n\n≥ 30 ml/min \n\n \n\n4 mg/kg once daily \n\n \n\nSee section 5.1 \n\n  \n\n< 30 ml/min \n\n \n\n4 mg/kg every 48 hours \n\n \n\n(1, 2) \n\nRIE or cSSTI \n\nassociated with SAB \n\n \n\n≥ 30 ml/min \n\n \n\n6 mg/kg once daily \n\n \n\nSee section 5.1 \n\n  \n\n< 30 ml/min \n\n \n\n6 mg/kg every 48 hours \n\n \n\n(1, 2) \n\ncSSTI = complicated skin and soft-tissue infections; SAB = S. aureus bacteraemia; RIE = right-sided \n\ninfective endocarditis \n\n(1) The safety and efficacy of the dose interval adjustment have not been evaluated in controlled \n\nclinical trials and the recommendation is based on pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and modelling results \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n\n(2) The same dose adjustments, which are based on PK data in volunteers including PK modelling \n\nresults, are recommended for adult patients on haemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory \n\nperitoneal dialysis (CAPD). Whenever possible, Daptomycin Hospira should be administered \n\nfollowing the completion of dialysis on dialysis days (see section 5.2).  \n\n \nHepatic impairment  \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary when administering daptomycin to patients with mild or moderate \n\nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) (see section 5.2). No data are available in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Therefore caution should be exercised if Daptomycin Hospira is \n\ngiven to such patients. \n \n\nElderly patients \n\nThe recommended doses should be used in elderly patients except those with severe renal impairment (see \n\nabove and section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (1 to 17 years of age) \nThe recommended dosage regimens for paediatric patients based on age and indication are shown below.  \n\n \n\nAge Group \n\nIndication \n\ncSSTI without SAB cSSTI associated with SAB \n\nDosage Regimen \nDuration of \n\nTherapy \nDosage Regimen \n\nDuration of \n\nTherapy \n\n12 to 17 \n\nyears \n\n5 mg/kg once every \n\n24 hours infused over \n\n30 minutes \n\nUp to 14 days \n\n7 mg/kg once every \n\n24 hours infused over \n\n30 minutes \n\n(1) 7 to 11 years \n7 mg/kg once every \n\n24 hours infused over \n\n30 minutes \n\n9 mg/kg once every \n\n24 hours infused over \n\n30 minutes \n\n2 to 6 years \n9 mg/kg once every \n\n24 hours infused over \n60 minutes \n\n12 mg/kg once every \n\n24 hours infused over \n\n60 minutes \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n1 to < 2 \n\nyears \n\n10 mg/kg once every \n\n24 hours infused over \n\n60 minutes \n\n12 mg/kg once every \n\n24 hours infused over \n\n60 minutes \n\ncSSTI = complicated skin and soft-tissue infections; SAB = S. aureus bacteraemia;  \n\n(1) Minimum duration of Daptomycin Hospira for paediatric SAB should be in accordance with the \n\nperceived risk of complications in the individual patient. The duration of Daptomycin Hospira may need \n\nto be longer than 14 days in accordance with the perceived risk of complications in the individual patient. \n\nIn the paediatric SAB study, the mean duration of IV Daptomycin Hospira was 12 days, with a range of \n\n1 to 44 days. The duration of therapy should be in accordance with available official recommendations.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira is administered intravenously in 0.9 % sodium chloride (see section 6.6). \n\nDaptomycin Hospira should not be used more frequently than once a day. \n\n \nCreatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels must be measured at baseline and at regular intervals (at least \n\nweekly) during treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients below the age of one year should not be given daptomycin due to the risk of potential \n\neffects on muscular, neuromuscular and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) that were \nobserved in neonatal dogs (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nIn adults, daptomycin is given by intravenous infusion (see section 6.6) and administered over a 30-minute \n\nperiod or by intravenous injection (see section 6.6) and administered over a 2-minute period. \n \n\nIn paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years, Daptomycin Hospira is given by intravenous infusion over a \n\n30-minute period (see section 6.6). In paediatric patients aged 1 to 6 years, Daptomycin Hospira is given \n\nby intravenous infusion over a 60-minute period (see section 6.6). \n\n \nReconstituted solutions of Daptomycin Hospira range in colour from clear yellow to light brown. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n\n \nGeneral  \n\nIf a focus of infection other than cSSTI or RIE is identified after initiation of daptomycin therapy \n\nconsideration should be given to instituting alternative antibacterial therapy that has been demonstrated to \n\nbe efficacious in the treatment of the specific type of infection(s) present.  \n\n \nAnaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions  \n\nAnaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with daptomycin. If an allergic reaction to \n\ndaptomycin occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.  \n\n \n\nPneumonia  \n\nIt has been demonstrated in clinical studies that daptomycin is not effective in the treatment of pneumonia. \nDaptomycin Hospira is therefore not indicated for the treatment of pneumonia.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nRIE due to Staphylococcus aureus  \n\nClinical data on the use of daptomycin to treat RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus are limited to 19 adult \npatients (see “Clinical efficacy in adults” in section 5.1). The safety and efficacy of daptomycin in \n\nchildren and adolescents aged below 18 years with RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of daptomycin in patients with prosthetic valve infections or with left-sided infective \nendocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus has not been demonstrated.  \n\n \n\nDeep-seated infections  \n\nPatients with deep-seated infections should receive any required surgical interventions (e.g. debridement, \n\nremoval of prosthetic devices, valve replacement surgery) without delay.  \n \n\nEnterococcal infections  \n\nThere is insufficient evidence to be able to draw any conclusions regarding the possible clinical efficacy of \n\ndaptomycin against infections due to enterococci, including Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus \n\nfaecium. In addition, dose regimens of daptomycin that might be appropriate for the treatment of \n\nenterococcal infections, with or without bacteraemia, have not been identified. Failures with daptomycin \nin the treatment of enterococcal infections that were mostly accompanied by bacteraemia have been \n\nreported. In some instances treatment failure has been associated with the selection of organisms with \n\nreduced susceptibility or frank resistance to daptomycin (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nNon-susceptible micro-organisms  \nThe use of antibacterials may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms. If \n\nsuperinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. \n\n \n\nClostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea  \n\nClostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been reported with daptomycin (see section 4.8). \nIf CDAD is suspected or confirmed, daptomycin may need to be discontinued and appropriate treatment \n\ninstituted as clinically indicated.  \n\n \n\nDrug/laboratory test interactions  \n\nFalse prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of international normalised ratio (INR) have \n\nbeen observed when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilised for the assay (see section \n4.5).  \n\n \n\nCreatine phosphokinase and myopathy  \n\nIncreases in plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK; MM isoenzyme) levels associated with muscular pains \n\nand/or weakness and cases of myositis, myoglobinaemia and rhabdomyolysis have been reported during \ntherapy with daptomycin (see also sections 4.5, 4.8 and 5.3). In clinical studies, marked increases in \n\nplasma CPK to > 5x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) without muscle symptoms occurred more commonly \n\nin daptomycin-treated patients (1.9 %) than in those that received comparators (0.5 %). Therefore, it is \n\nrecommended that:  \n\n- Plasma CPK should be measured at baseline and at regular intervals (at least once weekly) during \ntherapy in all patients.  \n\n- CPK should be measured more frequently (e.g. every 2-3 days at least during the first two weeks of \n\ntreatment) in patients who are at higher risk of developing myopathy. For example, patients with \n\nany degree of renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min; see also section 4.2), including \n\nthose on haemodialysis or CAPD, and patients taking other medicinal products known to be \nassociated with myopathy (e.g. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates and ciclosporin).  \n\n- It cannot be ruled out that those patients with CPK greater than 5 times upper limit of normal at \n\nbaseline may be at increased risk of further increases during daptomycin therapy. This should be \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\ntaken into account when initiating daptomycin therapy and, if daptomycin is given, these patients \n\nshould be monitored more frequently than once weekly.  \n\n- Daptomycin Hospira should not be administered to patients who are taking other medicinal products \nassociated with myopathy unless it is considered that the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.  \n\n- Patients should be reviewed regularly while on therapy for any signs or symptoms that might \n\nrepresent myopathy.  \n\n- Any patient that develops unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps should have \n\nCPK levels monitored every 2 days. Daptomycin Hospira should be discontinued in the presence of \nunexplained muscle symptoms if the CPK level reaches greater than 5 times upper limit of normal.  \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy  \n\nPatients who develop signs or symptoms that might represent a peripheral neuropathy during therapy with \n\ndaptomycin should be investigated and consideration should be given to discontinuation of daptomycin \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.3).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPaediatric patients below the age of one year should not be given daptomycin due to the risk of potential \n\neffects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) that were \n\nobserved in neonatal dogs (see section 5.3). \n \n\nEosinophilic pneumonia  \n\nEosinophilic pneumonia has been reported in patients receiving daptomycin (see section 4.8). In most \n\nreported cases associated with daptomycin, patients developed fever, dyspnoea with hypoxic respiratory \n\ninsufficiency, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates or organising pneumonia. The majority of cases occurred \nafter more than 2 weeks of treatment with daptomycin and improved when daptomycin was discontinued \n\nand steroid therapy was initiated. Recurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia upon re-exposure has been \n\nreported. Patients who develop these signs and symptoms while receiving daptomycin should undergo \n\nprompt medical evaluation, including, if appropriate, bronchoalveolar lavage, to exclude other causes (e.g. \n\nbacterial infection, fungal infection, parasites, other medicinal products).  Daptomycin should be \ndiscontinued immediately and treatment with systemic steroids should be initiated when appropriate.  \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptoms (DRESS) and vesiculobullous rash with or without mucous membrane involvement \n\n(Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)), which could be life-threatening \nor fatal, have been reported with daptomycin (see section 4.8). At the time of prescription, patients should \n\nbe advised of the signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions, and be closely monitored. If signs and \n\nsymptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, daptomycin should be discontinued immediately and an \n\nalternative treatment should be considered. If the patient has developed a severe cutaneous adverse \n\nreaction with the use of daptomycin, treatment with daptomycin must not be restarted in this patient at any \ntime. \n\n \n\nTubulointerstitial nephritis \n\nTubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been reported in post-marketing experience with daptomycin. \n\nPatients who develop fever, rash, eosinophilia and/or new or worsening renal impairment while receiving \ndaptomycin should undergo medical evaluation. If TIN is suspected, daptomycin should be discontinued \n\npromptly and appropriate therapy and/or measures should be taken. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\nRenal impairment has been reported during treatment with daptomycin. Severe renal impairment may in \n\nitself also pre-dispose to elevations in daptomycin levels which may increase the risk of development of \nmyopathy (see above).  \n\n \n\nAn adjustment of daptomycin dose interval is needed for adult patients whose creatinine clearance is \n\n< 30 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). The safety and efficacy of the dose interval adjustment have not \n\nbeen evaluated in controlled clinical trials and the recommendation is mainly based on pharmacokinetic \nmodelling data. Daptomycin should only be used in such patients when it is considered that the expected \n\nclinical benefit outweighs the potential risk.  \n\n \n\nCaution is advised when administering daptomycin to patients who already have some degree of renal \n\nimpairment (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min) before commencing therapy with Daptomycin Hospira. \nRegular monitoring of renal function is advised (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nIn addition, regular monitoring of renal function is advised during concomitant administration of \n\npotentially nephrotoxic agents, regardless of the patient’s pre-existing renal function (see section 4.5).  \n\n \n\nThe dosage regimen for daptomycin in paediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established. \n\n \nObesity  \n\nIn obese subjects with Body Mass Index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2 but with creatinine clearance > 70 ml/min, the \n\nAUC0-∞ daptomycin was significantly increased (mean 42 % higher) compared with non-obese matched \n\ncontrols. There is limited information on the safety and efficacy of daptomycin in the very obese and so \n\ncaution is recommended. However, there is currently no evidence that a dose reduction is required (see \nsection 5.2).  \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\n‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nDaptomycin undergoes little to no Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated metabolism. It is unlikely that \n\ndaptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of medicinal products metabolised by the P450 system.  \n\n \nInteraction studies for daptomycin were performed with aztreonam, tobramycin, warfarin and probenecid. \n\nDaptomycin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or probenecid, nor did these medicinal \n\nproducts alter the pharmacokinetics of daptomycin. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not \n\nsignificantly altered by aztreonam.  \n\n \nAlthough small changes in the pharmacokinetics of daptomycin and tobramycin were observed during \n\nco-administration by intravenous infusion over a 30-minute period using a daptomycin dose of 2 mg/kg, \n\nthe changes were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with an \n\napproved dose of daptomycin is unknown. Caution is warranted when daptomycin is co-administered with \n\ntobramycin. \n \n\nExperience with the concomitant administration of daptomycin and warfarin is limited. Studies of \n\ndaptomycin with anticoagulants other than warfarin have not been conducted. Anticoagulant activity in \n\npatients receiving daptomycin and warfarin should be monitored for the first several days after therapy \n\nwith Daptomycin Hospira is initiated.  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience regarding concomitant administration of daptomycin with other medicinal \n\nproducts that may trigger myopathy (e.g. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). However, some cases of \n\nmarked rises in CPK levels and cases of rhabdomyolysis occurred in adult patients taking one of these \nmedicinal products at the same time as daptomycin. It is recommended that other medicinal products \n\nassociated with myopathy should if possible be temporarily discontinued during treatment with \n\ndaptomycin unless the benefits of concomitant administration outweigh the risk. If co-administration \n\ncannot be avoided, CPK levels should be measured more frequently than once weekly and patients should \n\nbe closely monitored for any signs or symptoms that might represent myopathy (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.3).  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin is primarily cleared by renal filtration and so plasma levels may be increased during \n\nco-administration with medicinal products that reduce renal filtration (e.g. NSAIDs and COX-2 \n\ninhibitors). In addition, there is a potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction to occur during \nco-administration due to additive renal effects. Therefore, caution is advised when daptomycin is \n\nco-administered with any other medicinal product known to reduce renal filtration.  \n\n \n\nDuring post–marketing surveillance, cases of interference between daptomycin and particular reagents \n\nused in some assays of prothrombin time/international normalised ratio (PT/INR) have been reported. This \n\ninterference led to a false prolongation of PT and elevation of INR. If unexplained abnormalities of \nPT/INR are observed in patients taking daptomycin, consideration should be given to a possible in vitro \n\ninteraction with the laboratory test. The possibility of erroneous results may be minimised by drawing \n\nsamples for PT or INR testing near the time of trough plasma concentrations of daptomycin (see section \n\n4.4).  \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nNo clinical data on pregnancies are available for daptomycin. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary i.e., only if the \n\nexpected benefit outweighs the possible risk.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \nIn a single human case study, daptomycin was intravenously administered daily for 28 days to a nursing \n\nmother at a dose of 500 mg/day, and samples of the patient’s breast milk were collected over a 24-hour \n\nperiod on day 27. The highest measured concentration of daptomycin in the breast milk was 0.045 µg/ml, \n\nwhich is a low concentration. Therefore, until more experience is gained, breast-feeding should be \n\ndiscontinued when daptomycin is administered to nursing women.  \n \n\nFertility  \n\nNo clinical data on fertility are available for daptomycin. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect \n\nharmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  \n\n \n\nOn the basis of reported adverse drug reactions, daptomycin is presumed to be unlikely to produce an \neffect on the ability to drive or use machinery. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \nIn clinical studies, 2,011 adult subjects received daptomycin. Within these trials, 1,221 subjects received a \n\ndaily dose of 4 mg/kg, of whom 1,108 were patients and 113 were healthy volunteers; 460 subjects \n\nreceived a daily dose of 6 mg/kg, of whom 304 were patients and 156 were healthy volunteers. In \n\npaediatric studies, 372 patients received daptomycin, of whom 61 received a single dose and 311 received \n\na therapeutic regimen for cSSTI or SAB (daily doses ranged from 4 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg). Adverse \nreactions (i.e. considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal \n\nproduct) were reported at similar frequencies for daptomycin and comparator regimens.  \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions (frequency common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)) are:  \n\nFungal infections, urinary tract infection, candida infection, anaemia, anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, \nheadache, hypertension, hypotension, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, \n\ndiarrhoea, flatulence, bloating and distension, liver function tests abnormal (increased alanine \n\naminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), rash, pruritus, \n\nlimb pain, serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, infusion site reactions, pyrexia, asthenia.  \n\n \n\nLess frequently reported, but more serious, adverse reactions include hypersensitivity reactions, \neosinophilic pneumonia (occasionally presenting as organising pneumonia), drug reaction with \n\neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), angioedema and rhabdomyolysis.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n\nThe following adverse reactions were reported during therapy and during follow-up with frequencies \ncorresponding to very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \n\nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata):  \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \n\nTable 1  Adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-marketing reports \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions \n\nInfections and infestations Common: Fungal infections, urinary tract infection, candida \n\ninfection \n\nUncommon: Fungaemia \n\nNot known*: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea** \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders \nCommon: Anaemia \n\nUncommon: Thrombocythaemia, eosinophilia, international \n\nnormalised ratio (INR) increased, leukocytosis \n\nRare: Prothrombin time (PT) prolonged \n\nNot known*: Thrombocytopaenia \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders Not known*: Hypersensitivity**, manifested by isolated \n\nspontaneous reports including, but not limited to \n\nangioedema, pulmonary eosinophilia, sensation of \n\noropharyngeal swelling, anaphylaxis**, infusion \n\nreactions including the following symptoms: \n\ntachycardia, wheezing, pyrexia, rigors, systemic \n\nflushing, vertigo, syncope and metallic taste \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon: Decreased appetite, hyperglycaemia, electrolyte \n\nimbalance \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common: Anxiety, insomnia \n\nNervous system disorders Common: Dizziness, headache \n\nUncommon: Paraesthesia, taste disorder, tremor, eye irritation \n\nNot known*: Peripheral neuropathy** \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Uncommon: Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon: Supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystole \n\nVascular disorders Common: Hypertension, hypotension \n\nUncommon: Flushes \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nNot known*: Eosinophilic pneumonia1**, cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common: Gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, nausea, \n\nvomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, bloating \n\nand distension \n\nUncommon: Dyspepsia, glossitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common: Liver function tests abnormal2 (increased alanine \n\naminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase \n\n(AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) \n\nRare: Jaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon: Rash, pruritus \n\nUncommon: Urticaria \n\nNot known*: Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), \n\ndrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptoms (DRESS)**, vesiculobullous rash with or \n\nwithout mucous membrane involvement (SJS or \n\nTEN)** \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders \n\nCommon: Limb pain, serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK)2 \n\nincreased \n\nUncommon: Myositis, increased myoglobin, muscular weakness, \n\nmuscle pain, arthralgia, serum lactate dehydrogenase \n\n(LDH) increased, muscle cramps \n\nNot known*: Rhabdomyolysis3 ** \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon: Renal impairment, including renal failure and renal \n\ninsufficiency, serum creatinine increased \n\nNot known*: Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN)** \n\nReproductive system and \n\nbreast disorders \n\nUncommon: Vaginitis \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon: Infusion site reactions, pyrexia, asthenia \n\nUncommon: Fatigue, pain \n\n* Based on post-marketing reports. Since these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of \n\nuncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency which is therefore categorised as not \n\nknown.  \n\n** See section 4.4.  \n1 While the exact incidence of eosinophilic pneumonia associated with daptomycin is unknown, to date the \n\nreporting rate of spontaneous reports is very low (< 1/10,000).  \n2 In some cases of myopathy involving raised CPK and muscle symptoms, the patients also presented with \n\nelevated transaminases. These transaminase increases were likely to be related to the skeletal muscle \n\neffects. The majority of transaminase elevations were of Grade 1-3 toxicity and resolved upon \ndiscontinuation of treatment.  \n\n3 When clinical information on the patients was available to make a judgement, approximately 50 % of the \n\ncases occurred in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, or in those receiving concomitant \n\nmedicinal products known to cause rhabdomyolysis.  \n\n \n\nThe safety data for the administration of daptomycin via 2-minute intravenous injection are derived from \ntwo pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adult volunteers. Based on these study results, both methods of \n\ndaptomycin administration, the 2-minute intravenous injection and the 30-minute intravenous infusion, \n\nhad a similar safety and tolerability profile. There was no relevant difference in local tolerability or in the \n\nnature and frequency of adverse reactions. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \n\nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n4.9 Overdose  \n\n \n\nIn the event of overdose, supportive care is advised. Daptomycin is slowly cleared from the body by \n\nhaemodialysis (approximately 15 % of the administered dose is removed over 4 hours) or by peritoneal \n\ndialysis (approximately 11 % of the administered dose is removed over 48 hours).  \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, Other antibacterials, ATC code: J01XX09  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action  \n\nDaptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide natural product that is active against Gram positive bacteria only.  \n\n \nThe mechanism of action involves binding (in the presence of calcium ions) to bacterial membranes of \n\nboth growing and stationary phase cells causing depolarisation and leading to a rapid inhibition of protein, \n\nDNA, and RNA synthesis. This results in bacterial cell death with negligible cell lysis.  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  \nDaptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration dependent bactericidal activity against Gram positive organisms \n\nin vitro and in in vivo animal models. In animal models AUC/MIC and Cmax/MIC correlate with efficacy \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nand predicted bacterial kill in vivo at single doses equivalent to human adult doses of 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg \n\nonce daily.  \n\n \nMechanisms of resistance  \n\nStrains with decreased susceptibility to daptomycin have been reported especially during the treatment of \n\npatients with difficult-to-treat infections and/or following administration for prolonged periods. In \n\nparticular, there have been reports of treatment failures in patients infected with Staphylococcus aureus, \n\nEnterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium, including bacteraemic patients, that have been associated \nwith the selection of organisms with reduced susceptibility or frank resistance to daptomycin during \n\ntherapy.  \n\n \n\nThe mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is (are) not fully understood.  \n\n \nBreakpoints  \n\nMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoint established by the European Committee on \n\nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for Staphylococci and Streptococci (except S. \n\npneumoniae) are Susceptible ≤ 1 mg/l and Resistant > 1 mg/l.  \n\n \n\nSusceptibility  \nThe prevalence of resistance may vary geographically and over time for selected species and local \n\ninformation on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections. As necessary, expert \n\nadvice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the agent in at \n\nleast some types of infections is questionable. \n\n \n\nCommonly Susceptible Species \n\nStaphylococcus aureus * \n\nStaphylococcus haemolyticus  \n\nCoagulase negative staphylococci  \n\nStreptococcus agalactiae* \n\nStreptococcus dysgalactiae subsp equisimilis*  \n\nStreptococcus pyogenes* \n\nGroup G streptococci  \n\nClostridium perfringens  \n\nPeptostreptococcus spp  \n\nInherently resistant organisms \n\nGram negative organisms \n\n* denotes species against which it is considered that activity has been satisfactorily demonstrated in \n\nclinical studies.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in adults \n\nIn two adult clinical trials in complicated skin and soft tissues infections, 36 % of patients treated with \ndaptomycin met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The most common \n\ntype of infection treated was wound infection (38 % of patients), while 21 % had major abscesses. These \n\nlimitations of the patients population treated should be taken into account when deciding to use \n\ndaptomycin.  \n\n \n\nIn a randomised controlled open-label study in 235 adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia \n(i.e., at least one positive blood culture of Staphylococcus aureus prior to receiving the first dose) \n\n19 of 120 patients treated with daptomycin met the criteria for RIE. Of these 19 patients 11 were infected \n\nwith methicillin-susceptible and 8 with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The success rates in \n\nRIE patients are shown in the table below. \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \nPopulation \n\n \nDaptomycin \n\n \nComparator \n\nDifferences in \n\nSuccess \n\n n/N (%) n/N (%) Rates (95 % CI) \n\nITT (intention to treat) Population    \n\nRIE 8/19 (42.1 %) 7/16 (43.8 %) -1.6 % (-34.6, 31.3) \n\nPP (per protocol) Population    \n\nRIE 6/12 (50.0 %) 4/8 (50.0 %) 0.0 % (-44.7, 44.7) \n\n \n\nFailure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing Staphylococcus aureus infections was observed in \n19/120 (15.8 %) patients treated with daptomycin, 9/53 (16.7 %) patients treated with vancomycin and \n\n2/62 (3.2 %) patients treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin. Among these failures \n\nsix patients treated with daptomycin and one patient treated with vancomycin were infected with \n\nStaphylococcus aureus that developed increasing MICs of daptomycin on or following therapy (see \n\n“Mechanisms of resistance” above). Most patients who failed due to persisting or relapsing \nStaphylococcus aureus infection had deep-seated infection and did not receive necessary surgical \n\nintervention. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in paediatric patients \n\nThe safety and efficacy of daptomycin was evaluated in paediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years (Study \nDAP-PEDS-07-03) with cSSTI caused by Gram positive pathogens. Patients were enrolled in a stepwise \n\napproach into well-defined age groups and given age-dependent doses once daily for up to 14 days, as \n\nfollows: \n\n \n\n• Age group 1 (n=113): 12 to 17 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 5 mg/kg or standard-of-care \n\ncomparator (SOC); \n• Age group 2 (n=113): 7 to 11 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 7 mg/kg or SOC; \n\n• Age group 3 (n=125): 2 to 6 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 9 mg/kg or SOC; \n\n• Age group 4 (n=45): 1 to < 2 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 10 mg/kg or SOC. \n\n \n\nThe primary objective of Study DAP-PEDS-07-03 was to assess the safety of treatment. Secondary \nobjectives included an assessment of efficacy of age-dependent doses of intravenous daptomycin in \n\ncomparison with standard-of-care therapy. The key efficacy endpoint was the sponsor-defined clinical \n\noutcome at test-of-cure (TOC), which was defined by a blinded medical director. A total of 389 subjects \n\nwere treated in the study, including 256 subjects who received daptomycin and 133 subjects who received \n\nstandard-of-care. In all populations the clinical success rates were comparable between the daptomycin \nand SOC treatment arms, supporting the primary efficacy analysis in the ITT population.  \n\n \n\nSummary of sponsor-defined clinical outcome at TOC: \n\n \n\n Clinical Success in Paedatric cSSTI  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin \n\nn/N (%) \n\nComparator \n\nn/N (%) % difference \n\nIntent-to-treat 227/257 (88.3 %) 114/132 (86.4 %) 2.0 \n\nModified intent-to-treat 186/210 (88.6 %) 92/105 (87.6 %) 0.9 \n\nClinically evaluable 204/207 (98.6 %) 99/99 (100 %) -1.5 \n\nMicrobiologically evaluable (ME) 164/167 (98.2 %) 78/78 (100 %) -1.8 \n\n \n\nThe overall therapeutic response rate also was similar for the daptomycin and SOC treatment arms for \n\ninfections caused by MRSA, MSSA and Streptococcus pyogenes (see table below; ME population); \nresponse rates were > 94 % for both treatment arms across these common pathogens. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\nSummary of overall therapeutic response by type of baseline pathogen (ME population): \n\n \n\nPathogen \n\nOverall Successa rate in Paedatric cSSTI \n\nn/N (%) \n\nDaptomycin Comparator \n\nMethicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 68/69 (99 %) 28/29 (97 %) \n\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 63/66 (96 %) 34/34 (100 %) \n\nStreptococcus pyogenes 17/18 (94 %) 5/5 (100 %) \na Subjects achieving clinical success (Clinical Response of “Cure” or “Improved”) and microbiological \n\nsuccess (pathogen–level response of “Eradicated” or “Presumed Eradicated”) are classified as overall \ntherapeutic success. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of daptomycin was evaluated in paediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years (Study \n\nDAP-PEDBAC-11-02) with bacteraemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Patients were randomised in a \n\n2:1 ratio into the following age groups and given age-dependent doses once daily for up to 42 days, as \n\nfollows: \n \n\n• Age group 1 (n=21): 12 to 17 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 7 mg/kg or SOC comparator; \n\n• Age group 2 (n=28): 7 to 11 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 9 mg/kg or SOC; \n\n• Age group 3 (n=32): 1 to 6 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 12 mg/kg or SOC; \n\n \nThe primary objective of Study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 was to assess the safety of intravenous daptomycin \n\nversus SOC antibiotics. Secondary objectives included: Clinical outcome based on the blinded Evaluator’s \n\nassessment of clinical response (success [cure, improved], failure, or non-evaluable) at the TOC Visit; and \n\nMicrobiological response (success, failure, or non-evaluable) based on evaluation of Baseline infecting \n\npathogen at TOC. \n \n\nA total of 81 subjects were treated in the study, including 55 subjects who received daptomycin and \n\n26 subjects who received standard-of-care. No patients 1 to <2 years of age were enrolled in the study.

Steady-state concentrations are achieved by the third daily dose.  \n \n\nDaptomycin administered as a 2-minute intravenous injection also exhibited dose proportional \n\npharmacokinetics in the approved therapeutic dose range of 4 to 6 mg/kg. Comparable exposure (AUC \n\nand Cmax) was demonstrated in healthy adult subjects following administration of daptomycin as a \n\n30-minute intravenous infusion or as a 2-minute intravenous injection.  \n \n\nAnimal studies showed that daptomycin is not absorbed to any significant extent after oral administration.  \n\n \n\nDistribution  \n\nThe volume of distribution at steady state of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately \n0.1 l/kg and was independent of dose. Tissue distribution studies in rats showed that daptomycin appears \n\nto only minimally penetrate the blood-brain barrier and the placental barrier following single and multiple \n\ndoses.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins in a concentration independent manner. In \n\nhealthy adult volunteers and adult patients treated with daptomycin, protein binding averaged about 90 % \nincluding subjects with renal impairment.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation  \n\nIn in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolised by human liver microsomes. In vitro studies with \n\nhuman hepatocytes indicate that daptomycin does not inhibit or induce the activities of the following \nhuman cytochrome P450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. It is unlikely that \n\ndaptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of medicinal products metabolised by the P450 system.  \n\n \n\nAfter infusion of 14C-daptomycin in healthy adults, the plasma radioactivity was similar to the \n\nconcentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as \ndetermined by the difference in total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active \n\nconcentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma, and minor amounts of three \n\noxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has \n\nnot been identified.  \n\n \n\nElimination  \nDaptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. Concomitant administration of probenecid and \n\ndaptomycin has no effect on daptomycin pharmacokinetics in humans suggesting minimal to no active \n\ntubular secretion of daptomycin.  \n\n \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, plasma clearance of daptomycin is approximately 7 to 9 ml/hr/kg \nand its renal clearance is 4 to 7 ml/hr/kg.  \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nIn a mass balance study using radiolabelled material, 78 % of the administered dose was recovered from \n\nthe urine based on total radioactivity, whilst urinary recovery of unchanged daptomycin was \n\napproximately 50 % of the dose. About 5 % of the administered radiolabel was excreted in the faeces. \n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nElderly  \n\nFollowing administration of a single 4 mg/kg intravenous dose of daptomycin over a 30-minute period, the \nmean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35 % lower and the mean AUC0-∞ was \n\napproximately 58 % higher in elderly subjects (≥ 75 years of age) compared with those in healthy young \n\nsubjects (18 to 30 years of age). There were no differences in Cmax. The differences noted are most likely \n\ndue to the normal reduction in renal function observed in the geriatric population.  \n\n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age alone. However, renal function should be assessed and the \n\ndose should be reduced if there is evidence of severe renal impairment.  \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in paediatric subjects was evaluated in 3 single-dose \n\npharmacokinetic studies. After a single 4 mg/kg dose of daptomycin, total clearance normalised by weight \nand elimination half-life of daptomycin in adolescents (12-17 years of age) with Gram-positive infection \n\nwere similar to adults. After a single 4 mg/kg dose of daptomycin, total clearance of daptomycin in \n\nchildren 7-11 years of age with Gram-positive infection was higher than in adolescents, whereas \n\nelimination half-life was shorter. After a single 4, 8, or 10 mg/kg dose of daptomycin, total clearance and \n\nelimination half-life of daptomycin in children 2-6 years of age were similar at different doses; total \nclearance was higher and elimination half-life was shorter than in adolescents. After a single 6 mg/kg dose \n\nof daptomycin, the clearance and elimination half-life of daptomycin in children 13-24 months of age \n\nwere similar to children 2-6 years of age who received a single 4-10 mg/kg dose. The results of these \n\nstudies show that exposures (AUC) in paediatric patients across all doses are generally lower than those in \n\nadults at comparable doses. \n \n\nPaediatric patients with cSSTI \n\nA Phase 4 study (DAP-PEDS-07-03) was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of \n\ndaptomycin in paediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSTI caused by Gram-positive \n\npathogens. Daptomycin pharmacokinetics in patients in this study are summarised in Table 2. Following \n\nadministration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure was similar across different age groups after dose \nadjustment based on body weight and age. Plasma exposures achieved with these doses were consistent \n\nwith those achieved in the adult cSSTI study (following 4 mg/kg once daily in adults). \n\n \n\nTable 2  Mean (Standard Deviation) of Daptomycin Pharmacokinetics in Paediatric cSSTI \n\nPatients (1 to 17 Years of Age) in Study DAP-PEDS-07-03 \n \n\nAge Range 12-17 years (N=6) 7-11 years (N=2)a 2-6 years (N=7) \n1 to <2 years \n\n(N=30)b \n\nDose \n\nInfusion Time \n\n5 mg/kg \n\n30 minutes \n\n7 mg/kg \n\n30 minutes \n\n9 mg/kg \n\n60 minutes \n\n10 mg/kg \n\n60 minutes \n\nAUC0-24hr \n\n(g×hr/ml) \n387 (81) 438 439 (102) 466 \n\nCmax (g/ml) 62.4 (10.4) 64.9, 74.4 81.9 (21.6) 79.2 \n\nApparent t1/2 (hr) 5.3 (1.6) 4.6 3.8 (0.3) 5.04 \n\nCL/wt (ml/hr/kg) 13.3 (2.9) 16.0 21.4 (5.0) 21.5 \n\nPharmacokinetic parameter values estimated by noncompartmental analysis \naIndividual values reported as only two patients in this age group provided pharmacokinetic samples to \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nenable pharmacokinetic analysis; AUC, apparent t1/2 and CL/wt could be determined for only one of the \n\ntwo patients \nbPharmacokinetic analysis conducted on the pooled pharmacokinetic profile with mean concentrations \nacross subjects at each time point \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients with SAB \n\nA Phase 4 study (DAP-PEDBAC-11-02) was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics \n\nof daptomycin in paediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with SAB. Daptomycin \npharmacokinetics inpatients in this study are summarised in Table 3. Following administration of multiple \n\ndoses, daptomycin exposure was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body \n\nweight and age.

Simulation using a population pharmacokinetic model demonstrated that \n\nthe AUCss (area under the concentration-time curve at steady state) of daptomycin in paediatric patients \n\n1 to <2 years of age receiving 12 mg/kg once daily would be comparable to that in adult patients receiving \n\n6 mg/kg once daily. \n\n \nObesity  \n\nRelative to non-obese subjects daptomycin systemic exposure measured by AUC was about 28 % higher \n\nin moderately obese subjects (Body Mass Index of 25-40 kg/m2) and 42 % higher in extremely obese \n\nsubjects (Body Mass Index of > 40 kg/m2). However, no dose adjustment is considered to be necessary \n\nbased on obesity alone.  \n \n\nGender  \n\nNo clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \nFollowing administration of a single 4 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg intravenous dose of daptomycin over a \n\n30-minute period to adult subjects with various degrees of renal impairment, total daptomycin clearance \n\n(CL) decreased and systemic exposure (AUC) increased as renal function (creatinine clearance) decreased.  \n\n \n\nBased on pharmacokinetic data and modelling, the daptomycin AUC during the first day after \n\nadministration of a 6 mg/kg dose to adult patients on HD or CAPD was 2-fold higher than that observed in \nadult patients with normal renal function who received the same dose. On the second day after \n\nadministration of a 6 mg/kg dose to HD and CAPD adult patients the daptomycin AUC was approximately \n\n1.3-fold higher than that observed after a second 6 mg/kg dose in adult patients with normal renal \n\nfunction. On this basis, it is recommended that adult patients on HD or CAPD receive daptomycin once \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nevery 48 hours at the dose recommended for the type of infection being treated (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nThe dosage regimen for daptomycin in paediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established. \n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of daptomycin is not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh B classification of hepatic impairment) compared with healthy volunteers matched for \n\ngender, age and weight following a single 4 mg/kg dose. No dosage adjustment is necessary when \nadministering daptomycin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of \n\ndaptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C classification) have not been \n\nevaluated.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \n\nDaptomycin administration was associated with minimal to mild degenerative/regenerative changes in \n\nskeletal muscle in the rat and dog. Microscopic changes in skeletal muscle were minimal (approximately \n\n0.05 % of myofibres affected) and at the higher doses were accompanied by elevations in CPK. No \n\nfibrosis or rhabdomyolysis was observed. Depending on the study duration, all muscle effects, including \n\nmicroscopic changes, were fully reversible within 1-3 months following cessation of dosing. No functional \nor pathological changes in smooth or cardiac muscle were observed.  \n\n \n\nThe lowest observable effect level (LOEL) for myopathy in rats and dogs occurred at exposure levels of \n\n0.8 to 2.3-fold the human therapeutic levels at 6 mg/kg (30-minute intravenous infusion) for patients with \n\nnormal renal function. As the pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2) is comparable, the safety margins for \nboth methods of administration are very similar.  \n\n \n\nA study in dogs demonstrated that skeletal myopathy was reduced upon once daily administration as \n\ncompared to fractionated dosing at same total daily dose, suggesting that myopathic effects in animals \n\nwere primarily related to time between doses.  \n \n\nEffects on peripheral nerves were observed at higher doses than those associated with skeletal muscle \n\neffects in adult rats and dogs, and were primarily related to plasma Cmax. Peripheral nerve changes were \n\ncharacterised by minimal to slight axonal degeneration and were frequently accompanied by functional \n\nchanges. Reversal of both the microscopic and functional effects was complete within 6 months post-dose. \n\nSafety margins for peripheral nerve effects in rats and dogs are 8- and 6-fold, respectively, based on \ncomparison of Cmax values at the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) with the Cmax achieved on dosing \n\nwith 30-minute intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg once daily in patients with normal renal function.  \n\n \n\nThe findings of in vitro and some in vivo studies designed to investigate the mechanism of daptomycin \n\nmyotoxicity indicate that the plasma membrane of differentiated spontaneously contracting muscle cells is \nthe target of toxicity. The specific cell surface component directly targeted has not been identified. \n\nMitochondrial loss/damage was also observed; however the role and significance of this finding in the \n\noverall pathology are unknown. This finding was not associated with an effect on muscle contraction.  \n\nIn contrast to adult dogs, juvenile dogs appeared to be more sensitive to peripheral nerve lesions as \n\ncompared to skeletal myopathy. Juvenile dogs developed peripheral and spinal nerve lesions at doses \nlower than those associated with skeletal muscle toxicity.  \n\n \n\nIn neonatal dogs, daptomycin caused marked clinical signs of twitching, muscle rigidity in the limbs, and \n\nimpaired use of limbs, which resulted in decreases in body weight and overall body condition at doses \n\n≥ 50 mg/kg/day and necessitated early discontinuation of treatment in these dose groups. At lower dose \nlevels (25 mg/kg/day), mild and reversible clinical signs of twitching and one incidence of muscle rigidity \n\nwere observed without any effects on body weight. There was no histopathological correlation in the \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nperipheral and central nervous system tissue, or in the skeletal muscle, at any dose level, and the \n\nmechanism and clinical relevance for the adverse clinical signs are therefore unknown. \n\n \nReproductive toxicity testing showed no evidence of effects on fertility, embryofoetal, or postnatal \n\ndevelopment. However, daptomycin can cross the placenta in pregnant rats (see section 5.2). Excretion of \n\ndaptomycin into milk of lactating animals has not been studied.  \n\n \n\nLong-term carcinogenicity studies in rodents were not conducted. Daptomycin was not mutagenic or \nclastogenic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity tests.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Daptomycin Hospira is and what it is used for  \n\nThe active substance in Daptomycin Hospira powder for solution for injection/infusion is daptomycin. \n\nDaptomycin is an antibacterial that can stop the growth of certain bacteria. Daptomycin Hospira is used in \n\nadults and in children and adolescents (age from 1 to 17 years) to treat infections of the skin and the \ntissues below the skin. It is also used to treat infections in the blood when associated with skin infection.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira is also used in adults to treat infections in the tissues that line the inside of the heart \n\n(including heart valves) which are caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus. It is also \n\nused to treat infections in the blood caused by the same type of bacteria when associated with heart \ninfection.  \n\n \n\nDepending on the type of infection(s) that you have, your doctor may also prescribe other antibacterials \n\nwhile you are receiving treatment with Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Daptomycin Hospira  \n\nYou should not be given Daptomycin Hospira  \n\nIf you are allergic to daptomycin or to sodium hydroxide or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).  \n \n\nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse. If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor or nurse \n\nfor advice. \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Daptomycin Hospira:  \n\n- If you have, or have previously had kidney problems. Your doctor may need to change the dose of \nDaptomycin Hospira (see section 3 of this leaflet).  \n\n- Occasionally, patients receiving Daptomycin Hospira may develop tender or aching muscles or \n\nmuscle weakness (see section 4 of this leaflet for more information). If this happens tell your doctor. \n\nYour doctor will make sure you have a blood test and will advise whether or not to continue with \n\nDaptomycin Hospira. The symptoms generally go away within a few days of stopping Daptomycin \nHospira.  \n\n- If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores, or \n\nserious kidney problems after taking daptomycin. \n\n- If you are very overweight. There is a possibility that your blood levels of Daptomycin Hospira \n\ncould be higher than those found in persons of average weight and you may need careful monitoring \nin case of side effects.  \n\n \n\nIf any of these applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you develop any of the following symptoms:  \n\n- Serious, acute allergic reactions have been observed in patients treated with nearly all antibacterial \nagents, including Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms can include wheezing, difficulty breathing, \n\nswelling of the face, neck and throat, rashes and hives, or fever \n\n- Serious skin disorders have been reported with the use of Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms that \n\noccur with these skin disorders can include: \n\n- a new or worsening fever, \n- red raised or fluid-filled skin spots which may start in your armpits or on your chest or groin \n\nareas and which can spread over a large area of your body, \n\n- blisters or sores in your mouth or on your genitals. \n\n- A serious kidney problem has been reported with the use of Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms \n\ncan include fever and rash. \n- Any unusual tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, loss of feeling or difficulties with \n\nmovements. If this happens, tell your doctor who will decide whether you should continue the \n\ntreatment.  \n\n- Diarrhoea, especially if you notice blood or mucus, or if diarrhoea becomes severe or persistent.  \n\n- New or worsening fever, cough or difficulty breathing. These may be signs of a rare but serious lung \n\ndisorder called eosinophilic pneumonia. Your doctor will check the condition of your lungs and \ndecide whether or not you should continue Daptomycin Hospira treatment.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. The \n\nresults can suggest poor blood clotting when, in fact, there is no problem. Therefore, it is important that \n\nyour doctor takes into account that you are receiving Daptomycin Hospira. Please inform your doctor that \nyou are on treatment with Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will perform blood tests to monitor the health of your muscles both before you start treatment \n\nand frequently during treatment with Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\n \nChildren and adolescents  \n\nDaptomycin Hospira should not be administered to children below one year of age as studies in animals \n\nhave indicated that this age group may experience severe side effects.  \n\n \n\nUse in elderly  \nPeople over the age of 65 can be given the same dose as other adults, provided their kidneys are working \n\nwell. \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Daptomycin Hospira \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n\nIt is particularly important that you mention the following:  \n- Medicines called statins or fibrates (to lower cholesterol) or ciclosporin (a medicinal product used in \n\ntransplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic \n\ndermatitis). It is possible that the risk of side effects affecting the muscles may be higher when any \n\nof these medicines (and some others that can affect muscles) is taken during treatment with \n\nDaptomycin Hospira. Your doctor may decide not to give you Daptomycin Hospira or to stop the \nother medicine for a while.  \n\n- Pain killing medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 inhibitors \n\n(e.g. celecoxib). These could interfere with the effects of Daptomycin Hospira in the kidney.  \n\n- Oral anti-coagulants (e.g. warfarin), which are medicines that prevent blood from clotting. It may be \n\nnecessary for your doctor to monitor your blood clotting times.  \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nDaptomycin Hospira is not usually given to pregnant women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think \n\nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you \n\nare given this medicine.  \n\n \nDo not breast-feed if you are receiving Daptomycin Hospira, because it may pass into your breast milk \n\nand could affect the baby.  \n\n  \n\nDriving and using machines   \n\nDaptomycin Hospira has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines.  \n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Daptomycin Hospira is given  \n\nDaptomycin Hospira will usually be given to you by a doctor or a nurse.  \n\n \n\nAdults (18 years of age and above) \n\nThe dose will depend on how much you weigh and the type of infection being treated.  The usual dose for \nadults is 4 mg for every kilogram (kg) of body weight once daily for skin infections or 6 mg for every kg \n\nof body weight once daily for a heart infection or a blood infection associated with skin or heart infection. \n\nIn adult patients, this dose is given directly into your blood stream (into a vein), either as an infusion \n\nlasting about 30 minutes or as an injection lasting about 2 minutes. The same dose is recommended in \n\npeople aged over 65 years provided their kidneys are working well.  \n \n\nIf your kidneys do not work well, you may receive Daptomycin Hospira less often, e.g. once every other \n\nday. If you are receiving dialysis, and your next dose of Daptomycin Hospira is due on a dialysis day, you \n\nwill be usually given Daptomycin Hospira after the dialysis session.  \n\n \nChildren and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) \n\nThe dose for children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) will depend on the age of patient and the type \n\nof infection being treated. This dose is given directly into the blood stream (into a vein), as an infusion \n\nlasting about 30-60 minutes. \n\n \n\nA course of treatment usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks for skin infections. For blood or heart infections and \nskin infections your doctor will decide how long you should be treated.  \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nDetailed instructions for use and handling are given at the end of the leaflet.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Unlike in adults, daptomycin should not be administered by injection over a 2-minute \nperiod in paediatric patients. Paediatric patients 7 to 17 years old should receive daptomycin infused over \n\n30 minutes. In paediatric patients under 7 years old receiving a 9-12 mg/kg dose, daptomycin should be \n\nadministered over 60 minutes. Preparation of the solution for infusion requires an additional dilution step \n\nas detailed below.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira given as 30 or 60-minute intravenous infusion  \n \n\nA 50 mg/ml concentration of Daptomycin Hospira for infusion can be achieved by reconstituting the \n\nlyophilised product with 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.  \n\n \n\nThe fully reconstituted product will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the \nedge of the vial.  \n\n \n\nTo prepare Daptomycin Hospira for intravenous infusion, please adhere to the following instructions:  \n\nAseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute lyophilised Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\nTo minimise foaming, AVOID vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution. \n \n\n1. The polypropylene flip off cap should be removed to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper. \n\nWipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry \n\n(perform the same for the sodium chloride solution vial, if applicable). After cleaning, do not touch the \n\nrubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surface. Draw 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) \n\nsolution for injection into a syringe using a sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in \ndiameter, or a needleless device, then SLOWLY inject through the centre of the rubber stopper \n\ndirectly over the product plug in the vial. \n\n2. Release the syringe plunger and allow the syringe plunger to equalise the pressure before removing the \n\nsyringe from the vial. \n\n3. Hold the vial by the vial neck, tilt the vial and swirl vial contents until the product is completely \nreconstituted. \n\n4. The reconstituted solution should be checked carefully to ensure that the product is in solution and \n\nvisually inspected for the absence of particulates prior to use. Reconstituted solutions of Daptomycin \n\nHospira range in colour from clear yellow to light brown.  \n\n5. Slowly remove the reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/ml) from the vial using a sterile needle that \nis 21 gauge or smaller in diameter.  \n\n6. Invert the vial in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. Using a new syringe, insert \n\nthe needle into the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted, position the needle tip at the very bottom \n\nof the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle \n\nfrom the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove all \nof the solution from the inverted vial.  \n\n7. Replace needle with a new needle for the intravenous infusion.  \n\n8. Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required dose.  \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n9. Transfer the reconstituted solution into a sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) infusion bag (typical \n\nvolume 50 ml). \n\n10. The reconstituted and diluted solution should then be infused intravenously over 30 or 60 minutes.  \n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira is not physically or chemically compatible with glucose-containing solutions. The \n\nfollowing have been shown to be compatible when added to Daptomycin Hospira containing infusion \n\nsolutions: aztreonam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, fluconazole, levofloxacin, dopamine, heparin \n\nand lidocaine.  \n \n\nThe combined storage time (reconstituted solution in vial and diluted solution in infusion bag) at 25 °C \n\nmust not exceed 12 hours (24 hours if refrigerated). \n\n \n\nStability of the diluted solution in infusion bags is established as 12 hours at 25 °C or 24 hours if stored \nunder refrigeration at 2 °C – 8 °C.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira given as 2-minute intravenous injection (adult patients only) \n\n \n\nWater should not be used for reconstitution of Daptomycin Hospira for intravenous injection. Daptomycin \n\nHospira should only be reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %).  \n \n\nA 50 mg/ml concentration of Daptomycin Hospira for injection is obtained by reconstituting the \n\nlyophilised product with 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.  \n\n \n\nThe fully reconstituted product will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the \nedge of the vial.  \n\n \n\nTo prepare Daptomycin Hospira for intravenous injection, please adhere to the following instructions:  \n\nAseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute lyophilised Daptomycin Hospira. \n\nTo minimise foaming, AVOID vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution. \n \n\n1. The polypropylene flip off cap should be removed to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper. \n\nWipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry \n\n(perform the same for the sodium chloride solution vial, if applicable). After cleaning, do not touch \n\nthe rubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surface. Draw 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n\n(0.9 %) solution for injection into a syringe using a sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller \ndiameter, or a needleless device, then SLOWLY inject through the centre of the rubber stopper \n\ndirectly over the product plug in the vial. \n\n2.

The reconstituted solution should then be injected intravenously slowly over 2 minutes.  \n\n \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability on the reconstituted solution in the vial has been demonstrated for \n12 hours at 25 °C and up to 48 hours if stored under refrigeration (2 °C – 8 °C).  \n\n \n\nHowever, from a microbiological point of view the product should be used immediately. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than \n\n24 hours at 2 °C – 8 °C unless reconstitution /dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic \nconditions.  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned above.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira vials are for single-use only. Any unused portion remaining in the vial should be \ndiscarded. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira 500 mg powder for solution for injection/infusion \n\ndaptomycin \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you.  \n\n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Daptomycin Hospira is and what it is used for  \n\nThe active substance in Daptomycin Hospira powder for solution for injection/infusion is daptomycin. \nDaptomycin is an antibacterial that can stop the growth of certain bacteria. Daptomycin Hospira is used in \n\nadults and in children and adolescents (age from 1 to 17 years) to treat infections of the skin and the \n\ntissues below the skin. It is also used to treat infections in the blood when associated with skin infection.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira is also used in adults to treat infections in the tissues that line the inside of the heart \n(including heart valves) which are caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus. It is also \n\nused to treat infections in the blood caused by the same type of bacteria when associated with heart \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nDepending on the type of infection(s) that you have, your doctor may also prescribe other antibacterials \n\nwhile you are receiving treatment with Daptomycin Hospira.  \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Daptomycin Hospira  \n\n  \n\nYou should not be given Daptomycin Hospira  \nIf you are allergic to daptomycin or to sodium hydroxide or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).  \n\n \n\nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse. If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor or nurse \n\nfor advice. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Daptomycin Hospira:  \n\n- If you have, or have previously had kidney problems. Your doctor may need to change the dose of \nDaptomycin Hospira (see section 3 of this leaflet).  \n\n- Occasionally, patients receiving Daptomycin Hospira may develop tender or aching muscles or \n\nmuscle weakness (see section 4 of this leaflet for more information). If this happens tell your doctor. \n\nYour doctor will make sure you have a blood test and will advise whether or not to continue with \n\nDaptomycin Hospira. The symptoms generally go away within a few days of stopping Daptomycin \nHospira.  \n\n- If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores, or \n\nserious kidney problems after taking daptomycin. \n\n- If you are very overweight. There is a possibility that your blood levels of Daptomycin Hospira \n\ncould be higher than those found in persons of average weight and you may need careful monitoring \nin case of side effects.  \n\n- If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you develop any of the following symptoms:  \n\n- Serious, acute allergic reactions have been observed in patients treated with nearly all antibacterial \n\nagents, including Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms can include wheezing, difficulty breathing, \nswelling of the face, neck and throat, rashes and hives, or fever.  \n\n- Serious skin disorders have been reported with the use of Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms that \n\noccur with these skin disorders can include: \n\n- a new or worsening fever, \n\n- red raised or fluid-filled skin spots which may start in your armpits or on your chest or groin \nareas and which can spread over a large area of your body, \n\n- blisters or sores in your mouth or on your genitals. \n\n- A serious kidney problem has been reported with the use of Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms \n\ncan include fever and rash. \n\n- Any unusual tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, loss of feeling or difficulties with \nmovements. If this happens, tell your doctor who will decide whether you should continue the \n\ntreatment.  \n\n- Diarrhoea, especially if you notice blood or mucus, or if diarrhoea becomes severe or persistent.  \n\n- New or worsening fever, cough or difficulty breathing. These may be signs of a rare but serious \n\nlung disorder called eosinophilic pneumonia. Your doctor will check the condition of your lungs \n\nand decide whether or not you should continue Daptomycin Hospira treatment.  \n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. The \n\nresults can suggest poor blood clotting when, in fact, there is no problem. Therefore, it is important that \n\nyour doctor takes into account that you are receiving Daptomycin Hospira. Please inform your doctor that \n\nyou are on treatment with Daptomycin Hospira.  \n \n\nYour doctor will perform blood tests to monitor the health of your muscles both before you start treatment \n\nand frequently during treatment with Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \nDaptomycin Hospira should not be administered to children below one year of age as studies in animals \n\nhave indicated that this age group may experience severe side effects.  \n\n \n\nUse in elderly  \n\nPeople over the age of 65 can be given the same dose as other adults, provided their kidneys are working \nwell. \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Daptomycin Hospira \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n\nIt is particularly important that you mention the following:  \n- Medicines called statins or fibrates (to lower cholesterol) or ciclosporin (a medicinal product used in \n\ntransplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic \n\ndermatitis). It is possible that the risk of side effects affecting the muscles may be higher when any \n\nof these medicines (and some others that can affect muscles) is taken during treatment with \n\nDaptomycin Hospira. Your doctor may decide not to give you Daptomycin Hospira or to stop the \nother medicine for a while.  \n\n- Pain killing medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 inhibitors \n\n(e.g. celecoxib). These could interfere with the effects of Daptomycin Hospira in the kidney.  \n\n- Oral anti-coagulants (e.g. warfarin), which are medicines that prevent blood from clotting. It may be \n\nnecessary for your doctor to monitor your blood clotting times.  \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nDaptomycin Hospira is not usually given to pregnant women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think \n\nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you \n\nare given this medicine.  \n\n \nDo not breast-feed if you are receiving Daptomycin Hospira, because it may pass into your breast milk \n\nand could affect the baby.  \n\n  \n\nDriving and using machines   \n\nDaptomycin Hospira has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines.  \n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Daptomycin Hospira is given  \n\nDaptomycin Hospira will usually be given to you by a doctor or a nurse.  \n\n \n\nAdults (18 years of age and above) \n\nThe dose will depend on how much you weigh and the type of infection being treated. The usual dose for \nadults is 4 mg for every kilogram (kg) of body weight once daily for skin infections or 6 mg for every kg \n\nof body weight once daily for a heart infection or a blood infection associated with skin or heart infection. \n\nIn adult patients, this dose is given directly into your blood stream (into a vein), either as an infusion \n\nlasting about 30 minutes or as an injection lasting about 2 minutes. The same dose is recommended in \n\npeople aged over 65 years provided their kidneys are working well.  \n \n\nIf your kidneys do not work well, you may receive Daptomycin Hospira less often, e.g. once every other \n\nday. If you are receiving dialysis, and your next dose of Daptomycin Hospira is due on a dialysis day, you \n\nwill be usually given Daptomycin Hospira after the dialysis session.  \n\n \nChildren and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) \n\nThe dose for children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) will depend on the age of patient and the type \n\nof infection being treated. This dose is given directly into the blood stream (into a vein), as an infusion \n\nlasting about 30-60 minutes. \n\n \n\nA course of treatment usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks for skin infections. For blood or heart infections and \nskin infections your doctor will decide how long you should be treated.  \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nDetailed instructions for use and handling are given at the end of the leaflet.  \n\n \n\n \n4.

Unlike in adults, daptomycin should not be administered by injection over a 2-minute \nperiod in paediatric patients. Paediatric patients 7 to 17 years old should receive daptomycin infused over \n\n30 minutes. In paediatric patients under 7 years old receiving a 9-12 mg/kg dose, daptomycin should be \n\nadministered over 60 minutes. Preparation of the solution for infusion requires an additional dilution step \n\nas detailed below.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira given as 30 or 60-minute intravenous infusion  \n \n\nA 50 mg/ml concentration of Daptomycin Hospira for infusion can be achieved by reconstituting the \n\nlyophilised product with 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.  \n\n \n\nThe fully reconstituted product will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the \nedge of the vial.  \n\n \n\nTo prepare Daptomycin Hospira for intravenous infusion, please adhere to the following instructions:  \n\nAseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute lyophilised Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\nTo minimise foaming, AVOID vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution. \n \n\n1. The polypropylene flip off cap should be removed to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper. \n\nWipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry \n\n(perform the same for the sodium chloride solution vial, if applicable). After cleaning, do not touch the \n\nrubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surface. Draw 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) \n\nsolution for injection into a syringe using a sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in \ndiameter, or a needleless device, then SLOWLY inject through the centre of the rubber stopper \n\ndirectly over the product plug in the vial. \n\n2. Release the syringe plunger and allow the syringe plunger to equalise the pressure before removing the \n\nsyringe from the vial. \n\n3. Hold the vial by the vial neck, tilt the vial and swirl vial contents until the product is completely \nreconstituted. \n\n4. The reconstituted solution should be checked carefully to ensure that the product is in solution and \n\nvisually inspected for the absence of particulates prior to use. Reconstituted solutions of Daptomycin \n\nHospira range in colour from clear yellow to light brown.  \n\n5. Slowly remove the reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/ml) from the vial using a sterile needle that \nis 21 gauge or smaller in diameter.  \n\n6. Invert the vial in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. Using a new syringe, insert \n\nthe needle into the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted, position the needle tip at the very bottom \n\nof the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle \n\nfrom the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove all \nof the solution from the inverted vial.  \n\n7. Replace needle with a new needle for the intravenous infusion.  \n\n8. Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required dose.  \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n9. Transfer the reconstituted solution into a sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) infusion bag (typical \n\nvolume 50 ml). \n\n10. The reconstituted and diluted solution should then be infused intravenously over 30 or 60 minutes.  \n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira is not physically or chemically compatible with glucose-containing solutions. The \n\nfollowing have been shown to be compatible when added to Daptomycin Hospira containing infusion \n\nsolutions: aztreonam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, fluconazole, levofloxacin, dopamine, heparin \n\nand lidocaine.  \n \n\nThe combined storage time (reconstituted solution in vial and diluted solution in infusion bag) at 25 °C \n\nmust not exceed 12 hours (24 hours if refrigerated). \n\n \n\nStability of the diluted solution in infusion bags is established as 12 hours at 25 °C or 24 hours if stored \nunder refrigeration at 2 °C – 8 °C.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira given as 2-minute intravenous injection (adult patients only) \n\n \n\nWater should not be used for reconstitution of Daptomycin Hospira for intravenous injection. Daptomycin \n\nHospira should only be reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %).  \n \n\nA 50 mg/ml concentration of Daptomycin Hospira for injection is obtained by reconstituting the \n\nlyophilised product with 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.  \n\n \n\nThe fully reconstituted product will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the \nedge of the vial.  \n\n \n\nTo prepare Daptomycin Hospira for intravenous injection, please adhere to the following instructions:  \n\nAseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute lyophilised Daptomycin Hospira.  \n\nTo minimise foaming, AVOID vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution. \n \n\n1. The polypropylene flip off cap should be removed to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper. \n\nWipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry \n\n(perform the same for the sodium chloride solution vial, if applicable). After cleaning, do not touch \n\nthe rubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surface. Draw 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n\n(0.9 %) solution for injection into a syringe using a sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller \ndiameter, or a needleless device, then SLOWLY inject through the centre of the rubber stopper \n\ndirectly over the product plug in the vial. \n\n2.

The reconstituted solution should then be injected intravenously slowly over 2 minutes.  \n\n \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability on the reconstituted solution in the vial has been demonstrated for \n12 hours at 25 °C and up to 48 hours if stored under refrigeration (2 °C – 8 °C).  \n\n \n\nHowever, from a microbiological point of view the product should be used immediately. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than \n\n24 hours at 2 °C – 8 °C unless reconstitution /dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic \nconditions.  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned above.  \n\n \n\nDaptomycin Hospira vials are for single-use only. Any unused portion remaining in the vial should be \ndiscarded. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.
