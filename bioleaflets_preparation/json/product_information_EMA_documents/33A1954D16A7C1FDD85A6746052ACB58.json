NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZutectra 500 IU solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne pre-filled syringe of 1 ml contains Human hepatitis B immunoglobulin 500 IU. \n \nHuman protein 150 mg/ml of which at least 96 % is IgG, with a content of antibodies to hepatitis B \nvirus surface antigen (HBs) of 500 IU/ml. \n \nDistribution of IgG subclasses: \nIgG1:  59 % \nIgG2:  35 % \nIgG3: 3 % \nIgG4: 3 % \n \nThe maximum IgA content  is 6,000 micrograms/ml. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection  \n \nThe solution is clear and pale yellow or light brown. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection in HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative adult patients at \nleast one week after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure. HBV-DNA negative \nstatus should be confirmed within the last 3 months prior to OLT. Patients should be HBsAg negative \nbefore treatment start. \n  \nThe concomitant use of adequate virostatic agents should be considered as standard of hepatitis B re-\ninfection prophylaxis. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nIn HBV-DNA negative adults at least one week after liver transplantation subcutaneous injections of \nZutectra per week or fortnightly according to serum anti-HBs trough levels.  \n \nPrior to the initiation of subcutaneous treatment with Zutectra adequate anti-HBs serum levels should \nbe stabilised with an intravenous hepatitis B immunoglobulin to levels at or above 300-500 IU/l in \norder to ensure adequate anti-HBs coverage during the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous \ndosing.  Antibody levels >100 IU/l should be maintained in HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative patients.  \n \nThe dose can be individually established and adapted from 500 IU up to 1,000 IU (in exceptional cases \nup to 1,500 IU) subcutaneous injections on a weekly or fortnightly basis, according to the serum anti-\nHBs concentrations and at the discretion of the physician in charge. Antibody levels >100 IU/l should \nbe maintained. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPatients must be monitored for serum anti-HBs antibody levels regularly. Serum anti-HBs antibody \nlevels should be measured at least every 2-4 weeks and at the discretion of the physician in charge for \nat least half a year. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant indication for use of Zutectra in children under the age of 18. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor subcutaneous use only. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nInjection of the medicinal product by the patient or by caregiver in a home treatment requires training \nby a physician experienced in the guidance of patients for home treatment. The patient or caregiver \nwill be instructed in injection techniques, the keeping of a treatment diary and measures to be taken in \ncase of severe adverse events. A sufficient surveillance period with stable anti-HBs trough serum \nlevels of > 100 IU/l as well as a fixed dosage regimen is required: the monitoring schedule of patients \nanti-HBs antibody levels (see above) needs to be closely followed. In addition patient or caregiver \nmust comply with the injection technique as well as with the dosing regimen to ensure anti-HBs \ntrough serum levels > 100 IU/l after extended periods between level controls. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to human \nimmunoglobulins. \n \nZutectra must not be administered intravascularly. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEnsure that Zutectra is not administered into a blood vessel, because of the risk of shock. \n \nIf the recipient is a carrier of HBsAg, there is no benefit in administering this medicinal product. \n \nThere is no data about efficacy in post-exposure prophylaxis. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nTrue hypersensitivity reactions are rare. \n \nZutectra contains a small quantity of IgA. Individuals who are deficient in IgA have the potential for \ndeveloping IgA antibodies and may have anaphylactic reactions after administration of blood \ncomponents containing IgA. The physician must therefore weigh the benefit of treatment with Zutectra \nagainst the potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nRarely, human hepatitis B immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic \nreaction, even in patients who have tolerated previous treatment with human immunoglobulin. \n \nPotential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients: \n- are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin, by initially injecting the product slowly; \n- are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the injection. In particular, patients naive \n\nto human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative product or when there \nhas been a long interval since the previous injection should be monitored during the first \ninjection and for the first hour after the first injection, in order to detect potential adverse signs. \nAll other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after administration. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSuspicion of allergic or anaphylactic type reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the \ninjection. In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInterference with serological testing \n \nAfter injection of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in \nthe patient’s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. \n \nPassive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D may interfere with some \nserological tests for red cell antibodies, for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct Coombs’ \ntest). \n \nTransmissible agents \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped hepatitis \nA virus (HAV). The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as \nparvovirus B19. \n \nThere is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 \ntransmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an \nimportant contribution to the viral safety. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Zutectra is administered to a patient, the name and \nbatch number of the medicinal product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and \nthe batch of the medicinal product. This recommendation applies also for documentation in the \ntreatment diary during self-administration of the medicinal product in a home treatment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLive attenuated virus vaccines \n \nImmunoglobulin administration may interfere with the development of an immune response to live \nattenuated virus vaccines such as rubella, mumps, measles and varicella for a period of 3 months. \nAfter administration of this medicinal product, an interval of at least 3 months should elapse before \nvaccination with live attenuated virus vaccines. \n \nHuman hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be administrated three to four weeks after vaccination with \nsuch a live attenuated vaccine; in case administration of human hepatitis B immunoglobulin is \nessential within three to four weeks after vaccination, then revaccination should be performed three \nmonths after the administration of human hepatitis B immunoglobulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled \nclinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to pregnant women. Clinical experience \nwith immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy, or on the foetus \nand the neonate are to be expected. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThe safety of this medicinal product for use in breast-feeding has not been established in controlled \nclinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to breast-feeding mothers. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility studies have been performed (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHepatitis B immunoglobulin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nMost adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were mild to moderate in nature. In isolated cases human normal \nimmunoglobulins may cause an anaphylactic shock. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported in the context of 4,810 subcutaneous applications \nof Zutectra during four completed clinical trials and 1,006 applications during a non-interventional \npost marketing safety study (PASS). \nThe ADRs reported in four trials are summarised and categorised according to the MedDRA system \norgan class and frequency below. Frequency per injection has been evaluated using the following \ncriteria: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nThe effects were grouped by system organ classes under relevant medical headings. \n \nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class \n\nAdverse reactions Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations Nasopharyngitis Rare*  \nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Rare* \nNervous system disorders Headache Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Palpitations, cardiac discomfort Rare* \nVascular disorders Hypertension Rare*  \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nOropharyngeal pain Rare*  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Upper abdominal pain Uncommon \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nPruritus, rash Rare* \n\nMusculosceletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle spams Rare*  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nInjection site reactions like pain, \nurticaria at injection site, \nhaematoma and erythema \n\nCommon \n\nFatigue, tiredness Rare*  \n*  single case reports \n \nAdverse reactions observed with other human immunoglobulin preparations \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nWith normal immunoglobulins adverse reactions such as chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, \nallergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur \noccasionally. \nRarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated \ncases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous \nadministration. \n \nLocal reactions at injection sites  \nSwelling, soreness, redness, induration, local heat, itching, bruising and rash. \n \nFor safety information with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nConsequences of an overdose are not known. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, Specific immunoglobulins, Hepatitis \nB immunoglobulin  \nATC code: J06BB04 \n \nHepatitis B immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a specifically high content \nof antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe open, prospective, single-arm clinical trial  enrolled 23 liver transplant recipients, who had been \nreceiving intravenous hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis and subsequently switched to \nsubcutaneous Zutectra. The weekly subcutaneous dose was 500 IU for patients with bodyweight \n< 75 kg (a dose increase to 1000 IU was allowed, if medically required to maintain a safety level of \n> 100 IU) and 1000 IU for patients with bodyweight ≥ 75 kg. 2 patients received a higher and \n2 patients received a lower dose than recommended by the weight based dosing regimen. Serum anti-\nHBs trough levels of 100 IU/l and higher (primary efficacy endpoint) were maintained for all patients \nduring the 18 to 24 week trial period. The > 100 IU/l safety margin is the generally accepted level of \neffective prevention against HBV re-infection in liver transplant patients at risk. No patient \nexperienced HBV re-infection. Self-administration was feasible for most patients. \n \nThe mean anti-HBs serum level before switching was 393 ± 139 IU/l. All patients used antiviral \nmedicine. \n \nUsing the Clopper Pearson method, the failure rate after 18 weeks was 0 % for patients of the ITT set \n(95 % CI: [0, 14.8 %]). A failure rate of 0 % was also found for the facultative extension phase \n(week 24) (95 % CI: [0, 20.6 %]) \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe objectives of the open, prospective, single-arm clinical trial were the investigation of feasibility of \nhome self-administration (including patient compliance), efficacy and safety of subcutaneous \napplication of Zutectra in a population of stable patients during long-term treatment for prophylaxis \nagainst re-infection of a transplanted liver in 66 patients. All patients included in this study had to run \nthrough a training period of at least 29 days and home self-administration could start on day 36 at the \nearliest. With the exception of 6 patients who withdrew prior to day 36, all patients achieved complete \nhospital and home self-administration. No patient prematurely discontinued the study due to lack of \nfeasibility of home self-treatment. During the 48-weeks treatment phase constant serum HBs antibody \nconcentrations ≥ 100 IU/l were measured in all patients at all assessments with mean values of \n312.0 ± 103.5 IU/l at the end of the treatment period. In total, 53/66 patients (80.3 %) used antiviral \nmedication and 13 patients received monotherapy with Zutectra during this study. No hepatitis B re-\ninfection was reported and no patient was tested HBsAg positive during the treatment period of \n48 weeks. No serious adverse events were reported to be related to study medication. No fatal case \nwas observed during the study. \n \nThe objective of the open, prospective, single-arm clinical trial was the investigation of efficacy and \nsafety of Zutectra for prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection ≥ one week after orthotopic \nliver transplantation in HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative patients. At the time of transplantation 21 \npatients (42.9%) were tested positive for HDV, patients with a positive HIV or HCV test were \nexcluded from study participation. 49 patients received subcutaneous injections of Zutectra of 500 IU \n(1 mL) or 1,000 IU (2 mL) (dose adaptation in exceptional cases up to 1,500 IU) per week or \nfortnightly according to serum anti-HBs trough levels. The individual treatment duration per patient \nwas planned to be up to 24 weeks after transplantation. No treatment failures occurred during the 6-\nmonth study period. Serum HBs antibody concentrations above the minimum safety trough level of \n>100 IU/L were measured in all patients at all timepoints independent of the type of administration \n(investigator, caregiver or self-injection), the dose regimen (500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 IU) or the \ntreatment intervals. No clinical signs of a hepatitis B re-infection were observed and no patient was \ntested HBsAg positive or HBV-DNA positive during the study which confirms that effective \nprotection against Hepatitis B virus re-infection was provided by subcutaneous administration of \nZutectra as part of the combination treatment with HBV virostatic therapy 8 – 18 days after orthotopic \nliver transplantation. One non-serious adverse event was reported to be related to Zutectra (injection \nsite haematoma). No fatal case was observed during the study. \n \nThe non-interventional post authorization safety study (PASS 978) enrolled 61 adult patients \n≥ 6 months after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure. The objective of the study \nwas to evaluate the level of compliance of patients using subcutaneous Zutectra as home self- \ntreatment for preventing hepatitis B re-infection. Patients were to be treated with Zutectra in \naccordance with the information and dosage given in the SPC. Compliance according to anti-HBs \nserum levels could be shown for 57 (of 61) patients (93%), with no values below 100 IU/l and a mean \nanti-HBs serum level of 254.3 IU/l at the final visit. In total, 42/61 patients (68.9 %) used antiviral \nmedication and 19 patients received monotherapy with Zutectra during this study. No treatment failure \ndefined as positive HBV-DNA and HBsAg findings occurred during the entire observation period. No \nre-infection was observed. No serious adverse reaction was reported. No fatal case was observed \nduring the study. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \n \nZutectra is slowly absorbed into the recipient’s circulation and reaches a maximum after a delay of \n2-7 days. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in the reticuloendothelial system. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nElimination \n \nZutectra has a half-life of about 3-4 weeks. This half-life may vary from patient to patient. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nImmunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body, therefore toxicity testing in \nheterologous species is of no relevance. \n \nIn a local tolerance trial in rabbits, there was no evidence of irritation attributable to Zutectra. \n \nNo other non-clinical trials have been carried out. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nZutectra 500 IU solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nHuman hepatitis B immunoglobulin \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Zutectra is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Zutectra \n3. How to use Zutectra \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zutectra \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. How to inject Zutectra by yourself or by caregiver \n \n \n1. What Zutectra is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Zutectra is \n \nZutectra contains antibodies against the hepatitis B virus which are the body's own defensive \nsubstances to protect you from hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is an inflammation of the liver caused by the \nhepatitis B virus. \n \nWhat Zutectra is used for \n \nZutectra is used to prevent re-infection of hepatitis B in adults who have had a liver transplant at least \n1 week ago because they had liver failure caused by hepatitis B. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Zutectra  \n \nDo not use Zutectra \n- if you are allergic to human immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6).  \nAn allergic reaction may include sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, fast pulse, swelling of the \neyelids, face, lips, throat or tongue, rash or itching.  \n \nZutectra is for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection only. Injection into a vein or a blood vessel may \nresult in allergic shock. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nPlease tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment  \n- if you have been told that you have antibodies against immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your \n\nblood. This is very rare and may result in allergic reactions. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nYou may be allergic to immunoglobulins (antibodies) without knowing it, even if you have tolerated \nprevious treatments with human immunoglobulins. Particularly if you do not have enough \nimmunoglobulins of the type IgA in your blood, allergic reactions such as a sudden fall in blood \npressure or shock may occur.  \n \nYou will be carefully observed during and shortly after the 1st injection with Zutectra to make \nsure that you do not suffer from a reaction. If you have an allergic reaction to Zutectra, the injection \nwill be stopped immediately. Please tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you \nnotice any reactions during your injection with Zutectra. \n \nIf you are HBs antigen positive you will not receive Zutectra since there is no benefit in \nadministering this medicine to you. Your doctor will be able to explain this to you. \n \nFor your own safety you will be monitored for antibody levels regularly. \n \nPossible interference with blood tests \nZutectra might affect the results of certain blood tests (serological tests). Please tell your doctor about \nyour treatment with Zutectra prior to any blood test. \n \nInformation on the starting material of Zutectra and the possibility of transmission of infectious \nagents: \n \nThe starting material or what Zutectra is made from is human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of \nthe blood). \nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent \ninfections being passed on to patients. These include \n- careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \n\nare excluded, and  \n- the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections.  \nManufacturers of these medicines also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can \ninactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also \napplies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The \nmeasures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19 virus \n(causative agent of Ringel rubella). \n \nImmunoglobulins like Zutectra have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections \npossibly because the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are \nprotective. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time Zutectra is used (both at hospital or in a home treatment), \nthe name and batch number of the medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the \nbatches used. \n \nOther medicines and Zutectra \nTell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. \n \nVaccinations \n \nZutectra can reduce the effectiveness of some vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, chicken pox) for a \nperiod of up to 3 months. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nYou may have to wait at least 3 months after the last injection of Zutectra before you can have live \nattenuated vaccines. \n \nPlease tell your doctor about your treatment with Zutectra prior to any vaccination. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or healthcare professional for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nZutectra has no or negligible effects on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Zutectra \n \nZutectra is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. The contents of one syringe are \nintended for use once only. Do not inject into a blood vessel. \n \nIn most cases you will be given the injection by your doctor or nurse. However, if your antibody levels \nare sufficient and you have a fixed dose regimen, you or your caregiver may be trained to carry out the \ninjection at home (see below).  \n \nFor the documentation of your injections of Zutectra it is strongly recommended to use the treatment \ndiary. Your doctor will explain you how to use it. \n \nThe dose can be individually established and adapted from 500 IU up to 1,000 IU (in exceptional cases \nup to 1,500 IU) weekly or fortnightly. The dose will depend on your condition. Your doctor will \nregularly check your condition and tell you how much and how often you need to use Zutectra. \n \nInjecting by yourself or by caregiver \nYou can inject Zutectra yourself without the help of your doctor, if they have trained you to do this. If \nyou are administering Zutectra yourself, please read instructions in the section “How to inject \nZutectra by yourself or by caregiver” carefully. \n \nZutectra must be brought to room temperature (approx. 23°C-27°C) before use. \n \nIf you use more Zutectra than you should \nConsequences of an overdose are not known. However, if you have used more than the prescribed \ndose of Zutectra, contact your doctor, healthcare professional or pharmacist straight away for advice.  \n \nIf you forget to use Zutectra \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten injection. Talk to your doctor about managing \nthe dose. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you need to use Zutectra. \n \nMake sure you use Zutectra as prescribed and as instructed by your doctor to avoid the risk of a \nhepatitis B re-infection. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost side effects observed with Zutectra were mild to moderate in nature.  In very rare cases human \nnormal immunoglobulins may cause a serious allergic reaction. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nIf you notice any of the following effects stop the injection and tell your doctor immediately: \n- rash, \n- itching, \n- wheezing,  \n- difficulty in breathing, \n- swelling of the eyelids, face, lips, throat or tongue, \n- low blood pressure, fast pulse \n \nThis can be an allergic reaction or a serious allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock). \n \nIn case of any adverse event after the injection speak to your doctor immediately. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported with Zutectra: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n- injection site reactions: pain, hives (urticaria) at injection site, haematoma (a collection of \nblood in tissue under the skin), reddening of the skin (erythema). \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- headache  \n- upper abdominal pain (from your chest to the belly button) \n \nFurthermore the following reactions have been reported once only: \n- tiredness (fatigue) \n- high blood pressure (hypertension) \n- inflammation of the nose and throat (nasopharyngitis) \n- muscle spasm \n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n- abnormal heartbeat (palpitations), cardiac discomfort \n- itching (pruritus), rash \n- pain in the mouth and throat \n \nWith other human immunoglobulin preparations the following additional symptoms have been \nreported:  \n- chills \n- headache \n- dizziness \n- fever \n- vomiting \n- mild allergic reactions \n- nausea (urge to vomit) \n- joint pain \n- low blood pressure \n- moderate low back pain \n- injection site reactions: swelling, soreness, redness, hardening of the skin, local heat, itching, \n\nbruising and rash. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, healthcare professional or pharmacist. This includes \nany possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the \nnational reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more \ninformation on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Zutectra \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the outer carton and the syringe label \nafter EXP. \n \nStore and transport refrigerated (2°C-8°C).  Do not freeze. Keep the container in the outer carton in \norder to protect from light. \n \nThe solution should be administered immediately after opening the syringe. \n \nDo not use Zutectra if you notice that the solution is cloudy or has particles. \n \nAny unused medicine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  \nOnce the injection has been completed, dispose of all needles, syringes and empty glass containers \nwithout delay in a container intended for sharp objects you were provided with. \n \n \n6.

How to inject Zutectra by yourself or by caregiver \n \nThe following instructions are intended to explain how to inject Zutectra. Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. The doctor or his/her assistant will teach you the process of \nadministration. \n \nDo not attempt to inject Zutectra until you are sure that you understand how to prepare the injection \nsolution and give the injection. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nGeneral information:  \n- Keep the syringes and syringe disposal unit out of the reach of children; lock the supplies if \n\npossible. \n- Try to take the injection at the same time of day. This makes it easier to remember it. \n- Always double-check the dose. \n- The solution must be brought to room temperature before use. \n- Open each syringe only when you are ready for an injection. You should administer the \n\ninjection immediately after opening the syringe. \n- The colour of the solution can vary from clear to pale yellow up to light brown. Do not use \n\nsolutions that are cloudy or have particles. \n- This medicine must not be mixed with other medicines. \n \nBefore the injection: \n \n1. Wash your hands. It is important to have your hands and the items you use as clean as possible. \n \n2. Lay out everything you need in advance. Find a clean place where you can spread out all the items \nyou are going to use: \n \n- two alcohol swabs, \n- one syringe of Zutectra, \n- one needle suitable for subcutaneous injection. \n \nPlease note that alcohol swabs and needles are not contained in the pack and you need to supply them \nyourself. \n \n3. Before preparing the injection, decide where you are going to inject. You should inject Zutectra into \nthe fatty layer between the skin and muscle (about 8 to 12 mm under the skin). The best places for \ninjections are where the skin is loose and soft for example in the abdomen, arm, thigh or buttocks, and \naway from joints, nerves, bones.  \n \nImportant: Do not use on any area where you can feel lumps, bumps, firm knots, pain or on an area \nthat is discoloured, indented, scabbed, or where the skin is broken. Talk to the doctor or healthcare \nprofessional about these or any other unusual conditions you may find. You should rotate the injection \nsite at every injection. If some areas are too difficult for you to reach, you may need a caregiver to \nhelp you with these injections. \n \n4. Prepare the Zutectra syringe:  \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n- Take the syringe out of the pack. \n- Examine the solution carefully. It should be clear \n\nand contain no particles. If the solution is \ndiscoloured, cloudy or contains particles, discard \nit and start again with a new syringe. \n\n- Remove the protective cap from the syringe. \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n- Take the needle out of its sterile pack and fit the \n\nneedle onto the syringe. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n5. Get rid of any air bubbles that may be in the syringe. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n- Hold the syringe with the needle pointing \n\nupwards, and tap the syringe gently with your \nfingers until the air has collected at the tip. \nCarefully push the plunger in until the air bubbles \nhave disappeared. \n\n \nInjection \n \n1. Choose the area where you will make the injection and make a note of it in the diary. \n \n\n \n\nAbdomen (stomach): Do not use the area within \none inch around the navel. Avoid using the belt \nline area, as rubbing may irritate the injection site. \nAvoid surgical scars. This is likely to be the easiest \nplace to inject if you are doing it yourself. \n\nThighs: Use middle and outer areas where you can \npinch up tissue. You are likely to have more fatty \ntissue the closer you are to the hip and the further \nyou are from the knee. \n\nArms: The back of the upper arm should be used. It \nis hard to pinch up the tissue and inject Zutectra \nyourself using this site. If you do choose to inject \nyour arm yourself, try to pinch up the tissue by \nplacing your upper arm over the back of a chair or \nbrace it against a wall. It is much easier for \nsomeone else to use this site if you do need help. \n\nButtocks: Use any area where you can pinch up \ntissue. It’s harder to give yourself an injection \nhere. Try standing in front of a mirror to locate the \nsite or you may want to ask your caregiver to give \nyou the injection. \n\n \nIt's important to change (rotate) the injection sites. This will help the skin stay supple and help the \nmedicine be absorbed evenly. Rotating sites means starting at one site and using all other sites before \ngoing back to the first site you used. Then start the rotation again. It may be helpful to keep a record of \nwhere you had the last injection to avoid problems. \n \nThe administration in thighs is shown as an example in the following pictures: \n \n\n  \n2. Wipe the intended area with an alcohol swab. Let \nthe skin air-dry. \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n3. Gently pinch the skin together around the \ndisinfected injection site (to raise it up a little) and \npush the needle into the skin with a rapid, confident \nmovement at an angle of 45 to 90 degrees. Inject \n\n\n\n28 \n\nbeneath the skin as you have been shown by the \ndoctor or nurse.  \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n4. Inject the liquid by pressing gently on the plunger. \nAllow yourself enough time to inject the whole of the \nsolution until the syringe is empty. \n\n  \n \n\n \n5. Then pull the needle out immediately and let go of \nthe pinched skin. \n\n  \n \n\n \n6. Clean the injection site by wiping it in a circular \nmotion with the alcohol swab. \n \n \n\n \nDispose of all used items \n \nOnce the injection has been completed, dispose of all needles and empty glass containers without \ndelay in a container intended for sharp objects. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
