QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial contains nominally 1750 IU* antithrombin alfa**. \n\nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml of solution contains 175 IU antithrombin alfa. \n\n \nThe specific activity of ATryn is approximately 7 IU/mg protein.  \n \n* potency (IU) determined using European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic assay. \n \n** recombinant human antithrombin produced in the milk of transgenic goats by recombinant DNA \ntechnology (rDNA).  \n \nExcipient with known effect \nThis medicine contains 38 mg (1.65 mmol) sodium per 10 ml vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for infusion  \nThe powder is white to off-white. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nATryn is indicated for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in surgery of adult patients with \ncongenital antithrombin deficiency. It is normally given in association with heparin or low molecular weight \nheparin. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of patients \nwith congenital antithrombin deficiency. \n \nPosology \n \nDue to differences in pharmacokinetics of antithrombin alfa and plasma-derived antithrombin, treatment \nshould follow the specific dose recommendations described below. In the treatment of congenital \nantithrombin deficiency, the dose and duration of treatment should be individualised for each patient taking \ninto account the family history with regard to thromboembolic events, the actual clinical risk factors, and the \nlaboratory assessment.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe number of units of antithrombin alfa administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which is \nrelated to the current WHO standard for antithrombin concentrate. Antithrombin (AT) activity in plasma is \nexpressed either as a percentage (relative to human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the \nInternational Standard for antithrombin in plasma). One International Unit (IU) of antithrombin activity is \nequivalent to that quantity of antithrombin in one ml of normal human plasma. The calculation of the \nrequired dosage of antithrombin alfa is based on pre-treatment plasma antithrombin activity and body \nweight. \n \nThe therapeutic goal of treatment with antithrombin alfa is to increase to, and maintain antithrombin activity \nbetween 80 \u2013 120% of normal (0.8 \u2013 1.2 IU/ml) for the duration of treatment. \n \nInitial treatment starts with a loading dose targeting an antithrombin activity level of 100%. This initial \nloading dose is based on body weight and on the pretreatment antithrombin activity level.  \n \nThe required loading dose is determined using the following formula: \n \nLoading dose (IU) = [(100 \u2013 patient\u2019s pre-treatment AT activity level in %) /2.28] x Body Weight in kg \n \nThe usual loading dose in surgical patients (baseline AT activity 50%, bodyweight 75 kg) with congenital \nantithrombin deficiency in clinical risk situations is 20-25 IU/kg bodyweight. The loading dose should be \ngiven as a 15 minute infusion immediately followed by initiation of the maintenance infusion. \n \nThe required maintenance dose for surgical patients is given as a continuous infusion and is determined \nusing the following formula: \n \nMaintenance dose (IU/hour) = [(100 \u2013 patient\u2019s pre-treatment AT activity level in %) /10.22] x Body \nWeight in kg \n \nThe usual maintenance dose in surgical patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency in clinical risk \nsituations is 4-5 IU/kg/h. During consumptive states (e.g. major surgery, concomitant use of heparin) the \nactual dose may be higher. See therapeutic monitoring and dose adjustment recommendations below.  \nTreatment should be continued until the risk for venous thromboembolisms is reduced and/or when effective \nfollow-on anticoagulation has been established. \n \nTherapeutic Monitoring and Dose Adjustment \n \nThe dose should be adjusted on the basis of laboratory measurements of antithrombin activity. Response may \nvary in individual patients, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and different half-lives. Frequent \nantithrombin activity assessments and dosing adjustments may be necessary when starting treatment and just \nafter surgery.  \n \nAfter the start of the maintenance dose infusion, blood for AT activity levels should be drawn at 45 minutes \nafter the start of the loading dose infusion.  In case the AT activity level is between 80% and 120% \n(0.8 - 1.2 IU/ml), no dose adjustment is needed. In case the AT activity level is less than 80%, increase the \nmaintenance infusion rate by 50%. In case the AT activity level is greater than 120% decrease the infusion \nrate by 30%. Check AT activity level 30 minutes after any change in infusion rate, or four hours after a value \nwithin the target range. Subsequently, antithrombin activity should be checked 1-2 times a day and dose \nadjustments made accordingly. The antithrombin activity level should be maintained above 80% for the \nduration of the treatment, unless clinical particulars would indicate a different effective level. \n \nIt is possible that the surgical procedure will influence AT activity levels.  Therefore, an additional check of \nthe AT activity level should be done after the surgery. In case the activity level is below 80% a 15 minutes \nbolus infusion of AT can be given to quickly restore the AT activity level.  The dose can be calculated \nutilizing the post-surgical AT activity in the loading dose formula above. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ATryn in children and adolescents (<18 years) have not been established.  No data \nare available.  Paediatric antithrombin levels may be different from adult levels, particularly in neonates.   \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intravenous use. \nThe loading dose should be given as a 15 minute infusion immediately followed by initiation of the \nmaintenance infusion.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to goat proteins or goat milk components. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nAs with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Patients must \nbe closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. Patients \nshould be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, \ntightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur after administration, \nthey should contact their physician. In case of shock, standard medical treatment should be administered. \n \nPatients treated with this medicine should be monitored for possible clinical immunological reactions. \nAntibody status should be monitored and reported.  \n \nThe experience from repeated treatment with this medicine is very limited. Close surveillance with regard to \nimmunological reactions is especially important in such situations.  \n  \nPregnancy \nDue to differences in pharmacokinetic characteristics of ATryn in pregnant versus non-pregnant patients, \nrecommendations for dosing in pregnancy or in the peripartum period cannot be given. \n \nUse of concomitant anticoagulation \nClinical and biological surveillance when antithrombin is used together with heparin, low molecular weight \nheparin or other anticoagulants which potentiate the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin: \n \n\n- In order to properly adjust the dose of the anticoagulant and to avoid excessive hypocoagulability, \ncontrols of the extent of anticoagulation (APTT, and where appropriate anti-Factor Xa activity) should \nbe performed regularly, at close intervals and in particular in the first minutes/hours following the start \nof antithrombin use. \n\n- Antithrombin levels should be measured daily, in order to adjust the individual dose. The risk of \ndiminution of antithrombin levels by prolonged treatment with a non-fractionated heparin should be \ntaken into account. \n\n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains 1.65 mmol (or 37.9 mg) sodium per vial. To be taken into consideration by \npatients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nAntithrombin replacement during administration of anticoagulants that potentiate the anticoagulant activity \nof antithrombin (e.g., heparin, low molecular weight heparin), may increase the risk of bleeding. The \nhalf-life of recombinant antithrombin may be altered with concomitant treatment with these anticoagulants \ndue to an altered antithrombin turnover. Thus, concurrent administration of antithrombin with heparin, low \nmolecular weight heparin, or other anticoagulants that potentiate the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin to \na patient with increased risk of bleeding must be monitored clinically and biologically. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nLimited clinical data are available on the use of antithrombin alfa in pregnant women. Available data do not \nsuggest harmful effects to the mother or infant. Animal studies performed in rats did not indicate harmful \neffects on parturition, embryonal/foetal and post-natal development. However due to the difference in \npharmacokinetic characteristics of this medicine in pregnant versus non-pregnant patients no \nrecommendation for dosing in pregnancy can be given at this time (see section 4.4). Antithrombin alfa \nshould therefore not be used in pregnant women.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether antithrombin alfa or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling \nchild cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from ATryn therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the \nbenefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo information is available on the possible effects of antithrombin alfa on male and female fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions observed in clinical trials are dizziness, headache, \nhaemorrhage, nausea, venipuncture site haemorrhage, post procedural haemorrhage and wound secretion.  \nThe most serious reported adverse reactions observed in clinical trials are haemorrhage and post procedural \nhaemorrhage. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn clinical trials involving congenital antithrombin deficient patients (n=35) one mild undesirable effect of \n\u201capplication site pruritis\u201d was reported as related to treatment with ATryn.  \n \nIn other clinical trials with acquired antithrombin deficient cardiac surgery patients (n=118) and healthy \nvolunteers (n=102), undesirable effects reported to be related to treatment with ATryn that were observed \nmore than once are listed by System Organ Class in the table below. \n \nAdverse reactions are presented below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). \n \nMedDRA SOC Frequency \n\ncategory \nAdverse reactions \n\nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \nheadache \n\nVascular disorders Common Haemorrhage \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Nausea \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nCommon Venipuncture site haemorrhage \n\n Uncommon Feeling hot \n  Infusion site erythema \n  Infusion site pain \n  Infusion site rash \n  Venipuncture site bruise \nInjury and poisoning and procedural complications Common Post procedural haemorrhage \n  Wound secretion \n \nNo antibodies to antithrombin alfa have been detected up to 90 days following treatment with ATryn.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic Group: Antithrombotic agents: heparin group; ATC code: B01AB02. \nMechanism of action \n \nAntithrombin, a 58 kD, 432 amino-acid glycoprotein, belongs to the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) \nsuperfamily. It is one of the most important natural inhibitors of blood coagulation. The factors most strongly \ninhibited are thrombin and Factor Xa, but also factors of contact activation, intrinsic system and the Factor \nVIIa/tissue factor complex. Antithrombin activity is greatly enhanced by heparin and the anticoagulant \neffects of heparin depend on the presence of antithrombin. \n \nAntithrombin contains two functionally important domains. The first contains the reactive centre and \nprovides a cleavage site for proteinases such as thrombin, a prerequisite for forming a stable proteinase-\ninhibitor complex. The second is a glycosaminoglycan binding domain responsible for the interaction with \nheparin and related substances, which accelerates the inhibition of thrombin. The inhibitor-coagulation \nenzyme complexes are removed by the reticulo-endothelial system. \n \nNormal antithrombin activity in adults is 80 - 120% (0.8-1.2 IU/ml) and levels in neonates are about \n40 - 60% (0.4-0.6 IU/ml).  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn a formal clinical trial employing serial Duplex ultrasound examinations, antithrombin alfa was shown to \nbe effective in the prevention of thromboembolic events in fourteen congenital antithrombin deficient \npatients in clinical high risk situations. Some additional data have been obtained from a number of patients in \na compassionate use programme.  \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. This means that due to the \nrarity of the disease, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The \nEuropean Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and \nthis SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter intravenous administration of ATryn (intravenous bolus dose of 50 IU/kg or 100 IU/kg body weight) to \ncongenital antithrombin deficient patients without clinical symptoms of thrombosis, and not using heparin, \nthe incremental recovery was 2.07 \u00b1 1.54 %/IU/kg body weight (mean \u00b1 SD).

This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What ATryn is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use ATryn  \n3. How to use ATryn  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store ATryn  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What ATryn is and what it is used for \n \nATryn contains antithrombin alfa which is similar to the naturally occurring human antithrombin. In the \nbody, antithrombin blocks thrombin, a substance that plays a central role in the process of blood clotting. \n \nIf you have an inborn deficiency of antithrombin, your blood level of antithrombin is lower than normal. \nThis may result in a higher tendency to form clots in your blood vessels. This may be in the vessels of your \nlegs (deep vein thrombosis) or in other vessels of your body (thromboembolism). Around major surgical \nprocedures this tendency to clot is even more increased. Therefore, it is important that your antithrombin \nblood level be maintained at sufficient levels in these situations.  \n \nThis medicine is used in patients who have \u2018congenital antithrombin deficiency\u2019 (inherited low levels of the \nprotein antithrombin). It is used when the patients are having surgery, to prevent problems due to the \nformation of blood clots in the vessels. It is normally given in association with heparin or low molecular \nweight heparin (another medicine that helps to prevent blood clots). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use ATryn  \n \nDo not use ATryn: \n- if you are allergic to antithrombin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).  \n- if you are allergic to goat products as antithrombin alfa is produced in the milk of transgenic goats by \n\nrecombinant DNA technology (rDNA). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nIf you experience hives, itchy welts or wheals all over the skin, tightness of the chest, wheezing (difficulty \nbreathing), you should immediately contact your physician since these might be symptoms of a severe \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nallergic reaction. To test whether you developed an allergic reaction, blood may be collected and tested \nbefore and some time after you have been treated with ATryn. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nNo information on the use of ATryn in patients less than 18 years is available. This medicine should \ntherefore not be used if you are less than18 years. \n \nOther medicines and ATryn \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nWhen ATryn is used together with heparin (an anti-clotting medicine), or some other anti-clotting medicines, \nthis may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore your doctor will carefully monitor the use of this medicine \nwhen administered together with these anti-clotting medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nATryn is not indicated for use in pregnant women.  It is unknown whether it is present in breast milk. \nTherefore it is not recommended to breastfeed whilst being treated with this medicine. \n \nATryn contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains 1.65 mmol (or 37.9 mg) sodium per vial. To be taken into consideration by \npatients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to use ATryn \n \nYour treatment will be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the care of patients with \nan inborn deficiency of antithrombin.  \nYour health care provider will prepare a solution of antithrombin alfa to be administered to you through your \nvein. To protect you from developing blood clots the medicine will continue to be administered to you until \nyour doctor determines it safe to stop treatment. \n \nIf you use more ATryn than you should \n \nThe doctor will treat you, as appropriate, if you have any particular side effects. \n \nIf you stop using ATryn \n \nPlease discuss possibility of stopping the treatment with your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. If you experience \nhives, itchy welts or wheals all over the skin, tightness of the chest, wheezing (difficulty breathing), you \nshould immediately contact your physician since these might be symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. \n \nIn studies with ATryn the following side effects were reported: \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are:  \n\n\u2022 itching at the site of infusion  \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 bleeding (at site of infusion or after surgery) \n\u2022 nausea \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) are:  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\n\u2022 feeling hot \n\u2022 infusion site reactions such as pain, bruising and redness \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. \nYou can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting \nside effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store ATryn \n \nKeep out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nUnopened vials: \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nDo not use  this medicine after the expiry date stated which is stated on the carton and vial label after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last date of that month. \n \nReconstituted/diluted solutions: \nAfter reconstitution, from a microbiological pointy of view, this medicinal product should be used \nimmediately. However, chemical and physical stability has been demonstrated for 3 hours after \nreconstitution and 8 hours after dilution at a temperature not above 25\u00b0C. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat ATryn contains  \n \nThe active substance is antithrombin alfa*: 1750 IU.

This means that because of the rarity \nof this disease it has been impossible to get complete information on this medicine. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information on this medicine every year and this \nleaflet will be updated as necessary. \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu.   \n \n<-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nThis medicine is intended for single use only.  \n \nReconstitution/dilution \nVials should be brought at temperature not above 25\u00b0C prior to reconstitution.  The powder should be \nreconstituted with 10 ml of water for injections (WFI) injected along the side wall of the vial and gently \nswirled (not shaken) to prevent foaming.  \n \nThe reconstituted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and/or discolouration prior to \nadministration. The solution should be slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent.  Do not use solutions that \nare cloudy or have deposits.  \n \nThe vials should be used immediately and no longer than 3 hours after reconstitution. \n \nNormal sodium chloride solution 9 mg/ml (0.9%) may be added to dilute to a concentration convenient for \nadministration.   \n \nAdministration \nUpon complete dissolution, the reconstituted product may be drawn up into a sterile disposable syringe. The \nreconstituted product should be administered by intravenous infusion using a sterile disposable syringe or an \ninfusion bag with a 0.22 micron pore size in-line filter. The contents of the syringes should be administered \nimmediately and no longer than 3 hours after reconstitution.  If diluted, the solution prepared in infusion bags \nshould be administered immediately and no longer than 8 hours after dilution. Compatibility with PVC \ninfusion lines with in-line filters has been established.   \n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nThe therapeutic goal of treatment with antithrombin alfa is to increase to, and maintain antithrombin activity \nbetween 80 \u2013 120% (0.8 \u2013 1.2 IU/ml) for the duration of treatment. \n \nInitial treatment starts with a loading dose targeting an antithrombin activity level of 100%. This initial \nloading dose is based on body weight and on the pretreatment antithrombin activity level.  \n \nThe required loading dose is determined using the following formula: \n \nLoading dose (IU) = [(100 \u2013 patient\u2019s pre-treatment AT activity level in %) /2.28] x Body Weight in kg \n \nThe usual loading dose in surgical patients (baseline AT activity 50%, bodyweight 75 kg) with congenital \nantithrombin deficiency in clinical risk situations is 20-25 IU/kg bodyweight. The loading dose should be \ngiven as a 15 minute infusion immediately followed by initiation of the maintenance infusion. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n23 \n\nThe required maintenance dose for surgical patients is given as a continuous infusion and is determined \nusing the following formula: \n \nMaintenance dose (IU/hour) = [(100 \u2013 patient\u2019s pre-treatment AT activity level in %) /10.22] x Body \nWeight in kg \n \nThe usual maintenance dose in surgical patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency in clinical risk \nsituations is 4-5 IU/kg/h. During consumptive states (e.g. major surgery, concomitant use of heparin) the \nactual dose may be higher. See therapeutic monitoring and dose adjustment recommendations below.  \nTreatment should be continued until the risk for venous thromboembolisms is reduced and/or when effective \nfollow-on anticoagulation has been established. \n \nTherapeutic Monitoring and Dose Adjustment \n \nThe dose should be adjusted on the basis of laboratory measurements of antithrombin activity. Response may \nvary in individual patients, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and different half-lives. Frequent \nantithrombin activity assessments and dosing adjustments may be necessary when starting treatment and just \nafter surgery.  \n \nAfter the start of the maintenance dose infusion, blood for AT activity levels should be drawn at 45 minutes \nafter the start of the loading dose infusion.  In case the AT activity level is between 80% and 120% \n(0.8 - 1.2 IU/ml), no dose adjustment is needed. In case the AT activity level is less than 80%, increase the \nmaintenance infusion rate by 50%. In case the AT activity level is greater than 120% decrease the infusion \nrate by 30%. Check AT activity level 30 minutes after any change in infusion rate, or four hours after a value \nwithin the target range. Subsequently, antithrombin activity should be checked 1-2 times a day and dose \nadjustments made accordingly. The antithrombin activity level should be maintained above 80% for the \nduration of the treatment, unless clinical particulars would indicate a different effective level. \n \nIt is possible that the surgical procedure will influence AT activity levels.  Therefore, an additional check of \nthe AT activity level should be done after the surgery. In case the activity level is below 80% a 15 minutes \nbolus infusion of AT can be given to quickly restore the AT activity level.  The dose can be calculated \nutilizing the post-surgical AT activity in the loading dose formula above. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of ATryn in children and adolescents (<18 years) have not been established.  No data \nare available.  Paediatric antithrombin levels may be different from adult levels, particularly in neonates.   \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intravenous use. \nThe loading dose should be given as a 15 minute infusion immediately followed by initiation of the \nmaintenance infusion.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
