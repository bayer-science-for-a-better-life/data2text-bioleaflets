QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nInstanyl 50 micrograms/dose nasal spray, solution\nEach ml of solution contains fentanyl citrate equivalent to 500 micrograms fentanyl.\n1 dose (100 microlitres) contains 50 micrograms fentanyl.\n\nInstanyl 100 micrograms/dose nasal spray, solution\nEach ml of solution contains fentanyl citrate equivalent to 1,000 micrograms fentanyl.\n1 dose (100 microlitres) contains 100 micrograms fentanyl.\n\nInstanyl 200 micrograms/dose nasal spray, solution\nEach ml of solution contains fentanyl citrate equivalent to 2,000 micrograms fentanyl.\n1 dose (100 microlitres) contains 200 micrograms fentanyl.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nNasal spray, solution (nasal spray)\nClear, colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nInstanyl is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in adults already receiving maintenance \nopioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transitory exacerbation of pain that \noccurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent pain.\nPatients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral \nmorphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg oxycodone \ndaily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week \nor longer.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of opioid therapy in cancer patients. Physicians should keep in mind the potential of \nabuse, misuse, addiction and overdose of fentanyl.\n\nPosology\n\nPatients should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable \nadverse drug reactions. Patients must be carefully monitored during the titration process.\nTitration to a higher dose necessitates contact with the health care professional. In absence of adequate \npain control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and progression of underlying disease should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe dose of Instanyl for treatment of breakthrough pain was independent of the daily maintenance \ndose of opioid in the clinical studies (see section 5.1).\n\nMaximum daily dose: Treatment of up to four breakthrough pain episodes, each with no more than \ntwo doses separated by at least 10 minutes.\n\nPatients should wait 4 hours before treating another breakthrough pain episode with Instanyl during \nboth titration and maintenance therapy. On exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, \npatients can use Instanyl to treat it but they must wait at least 2 hours before doing so. Dose \nadjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered if the \npatient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or with \nmore than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours.\n\nDose titration\nBefore patients are titrated with Instanyl, it is expected that their background persistent pain is \ncontrolled by use of chronic opioid therapy and that they are experiencing no more than four episodes \nof breakthrough pain per day.\n\nMethod of titration\nThe initial strength should be one dose of 50 micrograms in one nostril, titrating upwards as necessary \nthrough the range of available strengths (50, 100, and 200 micrograms). If adequate analgesia is not \nachieved, redosing of the same strength may be administered at the earliest after 10 minutes. Each \ntitration step (dose strength) should be evaluated in several episodes.\n\nMaintenance therapy\nOnce the dose has been established according to the steps described above, the patient should be \nmaintained on this strength of Instanyl. If the patient has insufficient pain relief, redosing with same \nstrength can be undertaken at the earliest after 10 minutes.\n\nDose adjustment\nGenerally, the maintenance strength of Instanyl should be increased when a patient requires more than \none dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes.\nDose adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered\nif the patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or \nwith more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours.\n\nStart at 50 micrograms\n\n- Use one dose of Instanyl\n- Wait 10 minutes\n\nDose obtained\n\nAdequate pain relief with one dose of Instanyl\n\nYes No\n\nRedose with same \nstrength. \nConsider next higher \nstrength for next episode\n\n\n\n4\n\nIf adverse reactions are intolerable or persistent, the strength should be reduced or treatment with \nInstanyl be replaced by other analgesics.\n\nDiscontinuation of therapy\nInstanyl should be discontinued immediately if the patient no longer experiences breakthrough pain \nepisodes. The treatment for the persistent background pain should be kept as prescribed.\nIf discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be closely followed by the \nphysician as gradual downward opioid titration is necessary in order to avoid the possibility of abrupt \nwithdrawal effects.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly and Cachectic population\nLimited data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety are available for the use of Instanyl in patients \nabove 65 years of age. Elderly patients may have a reduced clearance, a prolonged half-life and higher \nsensitivity to fentanyl than younger patients. Limited data on pharmacokinetics are available for the \nuse of fentanyl in cachectic (debilitated) patients. Cachectic patients may have reduced clearance of \nfentanyl. Caution should therefore be taken in treatment of elderly, cachectic or debilitated patients.\nIn clinical trials elderly patients tend to titrate to a lower effective strength than patients less than \n65 years of age. Particular caution should be exercised when titrating Instanyl in elderly patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nInstanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment \n(see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nInstanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Instanyl in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nInstanyl is intended for nasal use only.\nIt is recommended that the patient sit or stand in upright position when administrating Instanyl.\nCleaning of the nasal spray tip is required after each use.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\nBefore using Instanyl for the first time, the nasal spray must be primed until a fine mist appears; 3 to \n4 actuations of the nasal spray are usually required.\n\nIf the product has not been used for a period of more than 7 days, the nasal spray must be primed again \nby actuating once before the next dose is taken.\n\nDuring the priming process product will be expelled. Therefore, the patient must be instructed that the \npriming should be conducted in a well ventilated area, pointing away from the patient and other people, \nand away from surfaces and objects that could come into contact with other people, particularly \nchildren.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nPatients without maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory depression.\nTreatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain.\nPatients being treated with medicinal products containing sodium oxybate.\n\n\n\n5\n\nSevere respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions.\nPrevious facial radiotherapy.\nRecurrent episodes of epistaxis (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRespiratory depression\n\nClinically significant respiratory depression may occur with fentanyl, and patients must be observed \nfor these effects. Patients with pain who receive chronic opioid therapy develop tolerance to \nrespiratory depression and hence the risk of respiratory depression in these patients may be reduced. \nThe use of concomitant central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of respiratory \ndepression (see section 4.5).\n\nChronic pulmonary disease\n\nIn patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, fentanyl may have more severe adverse \nreactions. In these patients, opioids may decrease respiratory drive.\n\nImpaired renal or hepatic function\n\nFentanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic or renal \nimpairment. The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Instanyl have \nnot been evaluated; however, when administered intravenously the clearance of fentanyl has shown to \nbe altered due to hepatic and renal impairment caused by alterations in metabolic clearance and \nplasma proteins.\n\nIncreased intracranial pressure\n\nFentanyl should be used with caution in patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, \nimpaired consciousness or coma.\nInstanyl should be used with caution in patients with cerebral tumour or head injury.\n\nCardiac disease\n\nFentanyl use may be associated with bradycardia. Fentanyl should therefore be used with caution in \npatients with previous or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. Opioids may cause hypotension, especially in \npatients with hypovolaemia. Instanyl should therefore be used with caution in patients with \nhypotension and/or hypovolaemia.\n\nSerotonin syndrome\n\nCaution is advised when Instanyl is coadministered with medicinal products that affect the \nserotoninergic neurotransmitter systems.\n\nThe development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the concomitant \nuse of serotonergic medicinal products such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and \nSerotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and with medicinal products which impair \nmetabolism of serotonin (including Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [MAOIs]). This may occur within \nthe recommended dose.\n\nSerotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), \nautonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \nabnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms \n(e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea).\n\nIf serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with Instanyl should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n6\n\nHyperalgesia\n\nAs with other opioids, in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, \nthe possibility of opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated.\n\nNasal conditions\n\nIf the patient experiences recurrent episodes of epistaxis or nasal discomfort while taking Instanyl, an \nalternative administration form for treatment of breakthrough pain should be considered.\n\nCommon cold\n\nThe overall extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with common cold without prior treatment with \nnasal vasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. For concomitant use of nasal \nvasoconstrictor see section 4.5.\n\nAbuse potential and dependence\n\nTolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration \nof opioids such as fentanyl. However, iatrogenic addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is \nknown to occur in the treatment of cancer related pain.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms\n\nWithdrawal symptoms may be precipitated through the administration of substances with opioid \nantagonist activity, e.g. naloxone, or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic (e.g. pentazocine, \nbutorphanol, buprenorphine, nalbuphine).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nConcomitant use of medicinal products containing sodium oxybate and fentanyl is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nCoadministration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic agent, such as a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake \nInhibitor (SSRI) or a Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a Monoamine Oxidase \nInhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening \ncondition.\n\nInstanyl is not recommended for use in patients who have received Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors \n(MAOIs) within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAOIs inhibitors has been \nreported with opioid analgesics.\n\nFentanyl is metabolised mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), \ntherefore potential interactions may occur when Instanyl is given concurrently with medicinal products \nthat affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with medicinal products that induce 3A4 activity may \nreduce the efficacy of Instanyl. The concomitant use of Instanyl with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. \nritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, \nand verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious \nadverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory depression.\nPatients receiving Instanyl concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be \ncarefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dose increase should be done with caution.\n\nIn a pharmacokinetic interaction study it was found that the maximum plasma concentration of nasally \napplied fentanyl was reduced about 50% by the concomitant use of oxymetazoline, while the time to \n\n\n\n7\n\nreach Cmax (Tmax) was doubled. This may reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. It is recommended that \nconcomitant use of nasal decongestants is avoided (see section 5.2).\n\nThe concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants (including opioids, sedatives, \nhypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers, sedating antihistamines and alcohol) \nand skeletal muscle relaxants, may produce additive depressant effects: hypoventilation, hypotension, \nprofound sedation, coma or death may occur. Therefore, the use of any of these medicinal products \nconcomitantly with Instanyl requires special patient care and observation.\n\nThe concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, \npentazocine) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low \nintrinsic activity and therefore partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce \nwithdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients.\n\nConcomitant use of Instanyl with other medicinal products (other than oxymetazoline) administered \nvia the nose has not been evaluated in the clinical trials. It is recommended that alternative \nadministration forms should be considered for concomitant treatment of concurrent diseases that can \nbe treated via nasal administration.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Instanyl \nshould not be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary and if the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFollowing long-term treatment, fentanyl may cause withdrawal in the new-born infant.\nIt is advised not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) because \nfentanyl passes through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the newborn (neonate). If \nInstanyl has been administered, an antidote for the child should be readily available.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nFentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breast-fed \nchild. Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breastfeeding should not be restarted \nuntil at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no human data on fertility available. In animal studies, male and female fertility was \nimpaired at sedative doses (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nopioid analgesics are known to impair the mental and/or physical ability required for driving or \noperating machinery. Patients undergoing treatment with Instanyl should be advised not to drive or \noperate machinery. Instanyl can cause somnolence, dizziness, visual disturbances or other adverse \nreactions which may affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nTypical opioid adverse reactions are to be expected with Instanyl. Frequently, most of these will cease \nor decrease in intensity with continued use of the medicinal product. The most serious adverse \n\n\n\n8\n\nreactions are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory \ndepression, hypotension and shock and all patients should be closely monitored for these.\n\nThe adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly related to treatment in the clinical trials of \nInstanyl are included in the table below.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following categories are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency of occurrence: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1000); and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with Instanyl and/or other fentanyl-containing \ncompounds during clinical studies and post marketing experience:\n\nSystem organ class Common Uncommon Not known\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia Hallucination, drug \n\ndependence \n(addiction), drug \nabuse\n\nNervous system disorders Somnolence, \ndizziness, headache\n\nSedation, \nmyoclonus, \nparaesthesia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndysgeusia\n\nConvulsions, loss of \nconsciousness\n\nEar and Labyrinth disorders Vertigo Motion sickness\nCardiac disorders Hypotension\nVascular disorders Flushing, hot flush\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nThroat irritation Respiratory \ndepression, \nepistaxis, nasal \nulcer, rhinorrhea\n\nNasal septum \nperforation, \ndyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea, vomiting Constipation, \nstomatitis, dry \nmouth\n\nDiarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nHyperhidrosis Pain of skin, pruritus\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nPyrexia Fatigue, malaise \nperipheral oedema, \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome*, neonatal \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nFall\n\n*opioid withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating have \nbeen observed with transmucosal fentanyl.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of fentanyl overdose are expected to be an extension of its pharmacological \nactions e.g. lethargy, coma and severe respiratory depression. Other signs may be hypothermia, \ndecreased muscle tonus, bradycardia and hypotension. Signs of toxicity are deep sedation, ataxia, \nmiosis, convulsions and respiratory depression, which is the main symptom.\n\nTreatment\n\nFor management of respiratory depression immediate countermeasures should be started including \nphysical or verbal stimulation of the patient. These actions can be followed by administration of a \nspecific opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Respiratory depression following an overdose may outlast \nthe duration of action of the opioid antagonist. The half-life of the antagonist may be short, therefore \nrepeated administration or continuous infusion may be necessary. Reversal of the narcotic effect may \nresult in acute onset of pain and release of catecholamines.\n\nIf the clinical situation warrants, a patent airway should be established and maintained, possibly with \nan oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube and oxygen should be administered and respiration \nassisted or controlled, as appropriate. Adequate body temperature and fluid intake should be \nmaintained.\n\nIf severe or persistent hypotension occurs, hypovolemia should be considered and the condition should \nbe managed with appropiate parenteral fluid therapy.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, opioids, ATC code: N02AB03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nFentanyl is an opioid analgesic interacting primarily with the opioid μ-receptor as a pure agonist with \nlow affinity for the - and κ-opioid receptors. The primary therapeutic action is analgesia. The \nsecondary pharmacological effects are respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypothermia, constipation, \nmiosis, physical dependence and euphoria.\n\nClinical safety and efficacy\n\nThe efficacy and safety of Instanyl (50, 100 and 200 micrograms) have been assessed in two \nrandomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled pivotal studies in 279 opioid-tolerant adult \ncancer patients (age 32-86 years) with breakthrough pain (BTP). The patients had an average of 1 to \n4 episodes per day while taking maintenance opioid therapy. Patients in the second pivotal study had \nearlier participated in the Instanyl pharmacokinetic study or in the first pivotal study.\n\nThe clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Instanyl. No distinct correlation between \nthe maintenance opioid dose and Instanyl doses have been established, however in the second pivotal \nstudy patients receiving low maintenance opioid dose tended to achieve effective pain relief with a \nlower strength of Instanyl compared to patients taking higher levels of maintenance opioid dose. This \nobservation was most distinct for patients receiving Instanyl 50 micrograms.\nIn the clinical studies in cancer patients, the most frequent strengths used were 100 and \n200 micrograms; however, patients should be titrated to the optimal dose of Instanyl for treating BTP \nin cancer (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n10\n\nAll three strengths of Instanyl demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.001) higher pain intensity \ndifference at 10 minutes (PID10) compared with placebo. Furthermore, Instanyl was significantly \nsuperior to placebo in BTP relief at 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes following administration. The results of \nsummary of PID at 60 minutes (SPID0-60) showed that all strengths of Instanyl had significantly higher \nmean SPID0-60 scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) demonstrating better pain relief of Instanyl \ncompared to placebo during 60 minutes.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Instanyl have been evaluated in patients taking the medicinal product at the \nonset of a breakthrough pain episode. Instanyl should not be used pre-emptively.\n\nThe clinical experience with Instanyl in patients with background opioid treatment equivalent to \n≥ 500 mg/day morphine or ≥ 200 micrograms/hour transdermal fentanyl is limited.\n\nInstanyl in doses above 400 micrograms have not been evaluated in clinical trials.\n\nOpioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or –gonadal axes. Some changes that can be \nseen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical \nsigns and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nFentanyl is highly lipophilic. Fentanyl exhibits three compartment distribution kinetics. Animal data \nshows that following absorption, fentanyl is rapidly distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and \nspleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles and fat. The plasma protein binding of fentanyl \nis approximately 80. The absolute bioavailability of Instanyl is approximately 89.\nClinical data show that fentanyl is absorbed very rapidly through the nasal mucosa. Administration of \nInstanyl in single doses ranging from 50 to 200 micrograms fentanyl per dose in opioid tolerant cancer \npatients produces a rapid Cmax level of 0.35 to 1.2 ng/ml. The corresponding median Tmax are \n12-15 minutes. However, higher values for Tmax were observed in a dose-proportionality study in \nhealthy volunteers.\n\nDistribution\n\nAfter intravenous administration of fentanyl the initial distribution half-life is approximately 6 minutes \nand a similar half-life is seen after the nasal administration of Instanyl. The elimination half-life is \napproximately 3-4 hours for Instanyl in cancer patients.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nFentanyl is metabolised primarily in the liver via CYP3A4. The major metabolite, norfentanyl is \ninactive. \n\nElimination\n\nAbout 75 of fentanyl is excreted into the urine, mostly as inactive metabolites, with less than 10 as \nunchanged active substance. About 9 of the dose is recovered in the faeces primarily as metabolites.\n\nLinearity\n\nInstanyl shows linear kinetics. Dose linearity from 50 micrograms to 400 micrograms of Instanyl has \nbeen demonstrated in healthy subjects.\nA drug-drug-interaction study was performed with a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline). Subjects \nwith allergic rhinitis received oxymetazoline nasal spray one hour prior to Instanyl. Comparable \nbioavailability (AUC) of fentanyl was achieved with and without oxymetazoline, while fentanyl Cmax\ndecreased and Tmax increased by a factor two when oxymetazoline was administered. The overall \n\n\n\n11\n\nextent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with allergic rhinitis without prior treatment with nasal \nvasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. Concomitant use of nasal vasoconstrictor \nshould be avoided (see section 4.5).\n\nBioequivalence\n\nA pharmacokinetic study has shown that Instanyl single-dose and multi-dose nasal spray are \nbioequivalent.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity,genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.\n\nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect was observed at \nhigh doses (300 µg/kg/day, s.c.) and is consistent with the sedative effects of fentanyl in animal \nstudies. Furthermore, studies in female rats revealed reduced fertility and enhanced embryonal \nmortality. More recent studies showed that effects on the embryo were due to maternal toxicity and \nnot to direct effects of the substances on the developing embryo. In a study on pre- and postnatal \ndevelopment the survival rate of offspring was significantly reduced at doses which slightly reduced \nmaternal weight. This effect could either be due to altered maternal care or a direct effect of fentanyl \non the pups. Effects on somatic development and behaviour of the offspring were not observed. \nTeratogenic effects have not been demonstrated.\n\nLocal tolerance studies with Instanyl in mini-pigs demonstrated that Instanyl administration was well \ntolerated.\n\nCarcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year \nsubcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) with fentanyl did not reveal any findings indicative of \noncogenic potential. Evaluation of brain slides from the carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain \nlesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl citrate. The relevance of these findings to \nhumans is unknown.\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nNasal spray, solution (nasal spray)\nClear, colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nInstanyl is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in adults already receiving maintenance \nopioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transitory exacerbation of pain that \noccurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent pain.\nPatients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral \nmorphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg oxycodone \ndaily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week \nor longer.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of opioid therapy in cancer patients. Physicians should keep in mind the potential of \nabuse, misuse, addiction and overdose of fentanyl.\n\nPosology\n\nPatients should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable \nadverse drug reactions. Patients must be carefully monitored during the titration process.\nTitration to a higher dose necessitates contact with the health care professional. In absence of adequate \npain control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and progression of underlying disease should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n15\n\nThe dose of Instanyl for treatment of breakthrough pain was independent of the daily maintenance \ndose of opioid in the clinical studies (see section 5.1).\n\nMaximum daily dose: Treatment of up to four breakthrough pain episodes, each with no more than \ntwo doses separated by at least 10 minutes.\n\nPatients should wait 4 hours before treating another breakthrough pain episode with Instanyl during \nboth titration and maintenance therapy. On exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, \npatients can use Instanyl to treat it but they must wait at least 2 hours before doing so. Dose \nadjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered if the \npatient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or with \nmore than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours.\n\nDose titration\nBefore patients are titrated with Instanyl, it is expected that their background persistent pain is \ncontrolled by use of chronic opioid therapy and that they are experiencing no more than four episodes \nof breakthrough pain per day. \n\nMethod of titration\nThe initial strength should be one dose of 50 micrograms in one nostril, titrating upwards as necessary \nthrough the range of available strengths (50, 100, and 200 micrograms). If adequate analgesia is not \nachieved, redosing of the same strength may be administered at the earliest after 10 minutes. Each \ntitration step (dose strength) should be evaluated in several episodes.\n\nMaintenance therapy\nOnce the dose has been established according to the steps described above, the patient should be \nmaintained on this strength of Instanyl. If the patient has insufficient pain relief, redosing with same \nstrength can be undertaken at the earliest after 10 minutes.\n\nDose adjustment\nGenerally, the maintenance strength of Instanyl should be increased when a patient requires more than \none dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes.\nDose adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered\nif the patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or \nwith more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours.\n\nStart at 50 micrograms\n\n- Use one dose of Instanyl\n- Wait 10 minutes\n\nDose obtained\n\nAdequate pain relief with one dose of Instanyl\n\nYes No\n\nRedose with same \nstrength. \nConsider next higher \nstrength for next episode\n\n\n\n16\n\nIf adverse reactions are intolerable or persistent, the strength should be reduced or treatment with \nInstanyl be replaced by other analgesics.\n\nDiscontinuation of therapy\nInstanyl should be discontinued immediately if the patient no longer experiences breakthrough pain \nepisodes. The treatment for the persistent background pain should be kept as prescribed.\nIf discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be closely followed by the \nphysician as gradual downward opioid titration is necessary in order to avoid the possibility of abrupt \nwithdrawal effects.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly and Cachectic population\nLimited data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety are available for the use of Instanyl in patients \nabove 65 years of age. Elderly patients may have a reduced clearance, a prolonged half-life and higher \nsensitivity to fentanyl than younger patients. Limited data on pharmacokinetics are available for the \nuse of fentanyl in cachectic (debilitated) patients. Cachectic patients may have reduced clearance of \nfentanyl. Caution should therefore be taken in treatment of elderly, cachectic or debilitated patients.\nIn clinical trials elderly patients tend to titrate to a lower effective strength than patients less than \n65 years of age. Particular caution should be exercised when titrating Instanyl in elderly patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nInstanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment\n(see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nInstanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Instanyl in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nInstanyl is intended for nasal use only.\nIt is recommended that the patient’s head is in upright position when administrating Instanyl.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nPatients without maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory depression. \nTreatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain.\nPatients being treated with medicinal products containing sodium oxybate.\nSevere respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions.\nPrevious facial radiotherapy.\nRecurrent episodes of epistaxis (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRespiratory depression\n\nClinically significant respiratory depression may occur with fentanyl, and patients must be observed \nfor these effects. Patients with pain who receive chronic opioid therapy develop tolerance to \nrespiratory depression and hence the risk of respiratory depression in these patients may be reduced. \nThe use of concomitant central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of respiratory \ndepression (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n17\n\nChronic pulmonary disease\n\nIn patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, fentanyl may have more severe adverse \nreactions. In these patients, opioids may decrease respiratory drive.\n\nImpaired renal or hepatic function\n\nFentanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic or renal \nimpairment. The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Instanyl have\nnot been evaluated; however, when administered intravenously the clearance of fentanyl has shown to \nbe altered due to hepatic and renal impairment caused by alterations in metabolic clearance and \nplasma proteins.\n\nIncreased intracranial pressure\n\nFentanyl should be used with caution in patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, \nimpaired consciousness or coma.\nInstanyl should be used with caution in patients with cerebral tumour or head injury.\n\nCardiac disease\n\nFentanyl use may be associated with bradycardia. Fentanyl should therefore be used with caution in \npatients with previous or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. Opioids may cause hypotension, especially in \npatients with hypovolaemia. Instanyl should therefore be used with caution in patients with \nhypotension and/or hypovolaemia.\n\nSerotonin syndrome\n\nCaution is advised when Instanyl is coadministered with medicinal products that affect the \nserotoninergic neurotransmitter systems.\n\nThe development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the concomitant \nuse of serotonergic medicinal products such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and \nSerotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and with medicinal products which impair \nmetabolism of serotonin (including Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [MAOIs]). This may occur within \nthe recommended dose.\n\nSerotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), \nautonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \nabnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms \n(e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea).\n\nIf serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with Instanyl should be discontinued.\n\nHyperalgesia\n\nAs with other opioids, in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, \nthe possibility of opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated.\n\nNasal conditions\n\nIf the patient experiences recurrent episodes of epistaxis or nasal discomfort while taking Instanyl, an \nalternative administration form for treatment of breakthrough pain should be considered.\n\n\n\n18\n\nCommon cold\n\nThe overall extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with common cold without prior treatment with \nnasal vasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. For concomitant use of nasal \nvasoconstrictor see section 4.5.\n\nAbuse potential and dependence\n\nTolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration \nof opioids such as fentanyl. However, iatrogenic addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is \nknown to occur in the treatment of cancer related pain.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms\n\nWithdrawal symptoms may be precipitated through the administration of substances with opioid \nantagonist activity, e.g. naloxone, or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic (e.g. pentazocine, \nbutorphanol, buprenorphine, nalbuphine).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nConcomitant use of medicinal products containing sodium oxybate and fentanyl is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nCoadministration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic agent, such as a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake \nInhibitor (SSRI) or a Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a Monoamine Oxidase \nInhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening \ncondition.\n\nInstanyl is not recommended for use in patients who have received Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors \n(MAOIs) within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAOIs inhibitors has been \nreported with opioid analgesics.\n\nFentanyl is metabolised mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), \ntherefore potential interactions may occur when Instanyl is given concurrently with medicinal products \nthat affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with medicinal products that induce 3A4 activity may \nreduce the efficacy of Instanyl. The concomitant use of Instanyl with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. \nritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, \nand verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious \nadverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory depression.\nPatients receiving Instanyl concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be \ncarefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dose increase should be done with caution.\n\nIn a pharmacokinetic interaction study it was found that the maximum plasma concentration of nasally \napplied fentanyl was reduced about 50% by the concomitant use of oxymetazoline, while the time to \nreach Cmax (Tmax) was doubled. This may reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. It is recommended that \nconcomitant use of nasal decongestants is avoided (see section 5.2).\n\nThe concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants (including opioids, sedatives, \nhypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers, sedating antihistamines and alcohol) \nand skeletal muscle relaxants, may produce additive depressant effects: hypoventilation, hypotension, \nprofound sedation, coma or death may occur. Therefore, the use of any of these medicinal products \nconcomitantly with Instanyl requires special patient care and observation.\n\nThe concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, \npentazocine) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low \n\n\n\n19\n\nintrinsic activity and therefore partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce \nwithdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients.\n\nConcomitant use of Instanyl with other medicinal products (other than oxymetazoline) administered \nvia the nose has not been evaluated in the clinical trials. It is recommended that alternative \nadministration forms should be considered for concomitant treatment of concurrent diseases that can \nbe treated via nasal administration.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Instanyl \nshould not be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary and if the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFollowing long-term treatment, fentanyl may cause withdrawal in the new-born infant.\nIt is advised not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) because \nfentanyl passes through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the newborn (neonate). If \nInstanyl has been administered, an antidote for the child should be readily available.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nFentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breast-fed \nchild. Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breastfeeding should not be restarted \nuntil at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no human data on fertility available. In animal studies, male and female fertility was \nimpaired at sedative doses (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nopioid analgesics are known to impair the mental and/or physical ability required for driving or \noperating machinery. Patients undergoing treatment with Instanyl should be advised not to drive or \noperate machinery. Instanyl can cause somnolence, dizziness, visual disturbances or other adverse \nreactions which may affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nTypical opioid adverse reactions are to be expected with Instanyl. Frequently, most of these will cease \nor decrease in intensity with continued use of the medicinal product. The most serious adverse \nreactions are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory \ndepression, hypotension and shock and all patients should be closely monitored for these.\n\nThe adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly related to treatment in the clinical trials of \nInstanyl are included in the table below.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following categories are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency of occurrence: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1000); and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\n\n\n20\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with Instanyl and/or other fentanyl-containing \ncompounds during clinical studies and post marketing experience:\n\nSystem organ class Common Uncommon Not known\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia Hallucination, drug \n\ndependence \n(addiction), drug \nabuse\n\nNervous system disorders Somnolence, \ndizziness, headache\n\nSedation, myoclonus, \nparaesthesia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndysgeusia\n\nConvulsions, loss of \nconsciousness\n\nEar and Labyrinth disorders Vertigo Motion sickness\nCardiac disorders Hypotension\nVascular disorders Flushing, hot flush\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nThroat irritation Respiratory \ndepression, epistaxis, \nnasal ulcer, rhinorrhea\n\nNasal septum \nperforation, \ndyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea, vomiting Constipation, \nstomatitis, dry mouth\n\nDiarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nHyperhidrosis Pain of skin, pruritus\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nPyrexia Fatigue, malaise \nperipheral oedema, \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome*, neonatal \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nFall\n\n*opioid withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating have \nbeen observed with transmucosal fentanyl.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of fentanyl overdose are expected to be an extension of its pharmacological \nactions e.g. lethargy, coma and severe respiratory depression. Other signs may be hypothermia, \ndecreased muscle tonus, bradycardia and hypotension. Signs of toxicity are deep sedation, ataxia, \nmiosis, convulsions and respiratory depression, which is the main symptom.\n\nTreatment\n\nFor management of respiratory depression immediate countermeasures should be started including \nphysical or verbal stimulation of the patient. These actions can be followed by administration of a \nspecific opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Respiratory depression following an overdose may outlast \nthe duration of action of the opioid antagonist. The half-life of the antagonist may be short, therefore \n\n\n\n21\n\nrepeated administration or continuous infusion may be necessary. Reversal of the narcotic effect may \nresult in acute onset of pain and release of catecholamines.\n\nIf the clinical situation warrants, a patent airway should be established and maintained, possibly with \nan oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube and oxygen should be administered and respiration \nassisted or controlled, as appropriate. Adequate body temperature and fluid intake should be \nmaintained.\n\nIf severe or persistent hypotension occurs, hypovolemia should be considered and the condition should \nbe managed with appropiate parenteral fluid therapy.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, opioids, ATC code: N02AB03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nFentanyl is an opioid analgesic interacting primarily with the opioid μ-receptor as a pure agonist with \nlow affinity for the - and κ-opioid receptors. The primary therapeutic action is analgesia. The \nsecondary pharmacological effects are respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypothermia, constipation, \nmiosis, physical dependence and euphoria.\n\nClinical safety and efficacy\n\nThe efficacy and safety of Instanyl (50, 100 and 200 micrograms) have been assessed in two \nrandomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled pivotal studies in 279 opioid-tolerant adult \ncancer patients (age 32-86 years) with breakthrough pain (BTP). The patients had an average of 1 to \n4 episodes per day while taking maintenance opioid therapy. Patients in the second pivotal study had \nearlier participated in the Instanyl pharmacokinetic study or in the first pivotal study.\n\nThe clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Instanyl. No distinct correlation between \nthe maintenance opioid dose and Instanyl doses have been established, however in the second pivotal \nstudy patients receiving low maintenance opioid dose tended to achieve effective pain relief with a \nlower strength of Instanyl compared to patients taking higher levels of maintenance opioid dose. This \nobservation was most distinct for patients receiving Instanyl 50 micrograms.\nIn the clinical studies in cancer patients, the most frequent strengths used were 100 and \n200 micrograms; however, patients should be titrated to the optimal dose of Instanyl for treating BTP \nin cancer (see section 4.2).\n\nAll three strengths of Instanyl demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.001) higher pain intensity \ndifference at 10 minutes (PID10) compared with placebo. Furthermore, Instanyl was significantly \nsuperior to placebo in BTP relief at 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes following administration. The results of \nsummary of PID at 60 minutes (SPID0-60) showed that all strengths of Instanyl had significantly higher \nmean SPID0-60 scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) demonstrating better pain relief of Instanyl \ncompared to placebo during 60 minutes.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Instanyl have been evaluated in patients taking the medicinal product at the \nonset of a breakthrough pain episode. Instanyl should not be used pre-emptively.\n\nThe clinical experience with Instanyl in patients with background opioid treatment equivalent to \n≥ 500 mg/day morphine or ≥ 200 micrograms/hour transdermal fentanyl is limited.\n\nInstanyl in doses above 400 micrograms have not been evaluated in clinical trials.\n\n\n\n22\n\nOpioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or –gonadal axes. Some changes that can be \nseen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical \nsigns and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nFentanyl is highly lipophilic. Fentanyl exhibits three compartment distribution kinetics. Animal data \nshows that following absorption, fentanyl is rapidly distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and \nspleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles and fat. The plasma protein binding of fentanyl \nis approximately 80. The absolute bioavailability of Instanyl is approximately 89.\nClinical data show that fentanyl is absorbed very rapidly through the nasal mucosa. Administration of \nInstanyl in single doses ranging from 50 to 200 micrograms fentanyl per dose in opioid tolerant cancer \npatients produces a rapid Cmax level of 0.35 to 1.2 ng/ml. The corresponding median Tmax are \n12-15 minutes. However, higher values for Tmax were observed in a dose-proportionality study in \nhealthy volunteers.\n\nDistribution\n\nAfter intravenous administration of fentanyl the initial distribution half-life is approximately 6 minutes \nand a similar half-life is seen after the nasal administration of Instanyl. The elimination half-life is \napproximately 3-4 hours for Instanyl in cancer patients.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nFentanyl is metabolised primarily in the liver via CYP3A4. The major metabolite, norfentanyl is \ninactive. \n\nElimination\n\nAbout 75 of fentanyl is excreted into the urine, mostly as inactive metabolites, with less than 10 as \nunchanged active substance. About 9 of the dose is recovered in the faeces primarily as metabolites.\n\nLinearity\n\nInstanyl shows linear kinetics. Dose linearity from 50 micrograms to 400 micrograms of Instanyl has \nbeen demonstrated in healthy subjects.\nA drug-drug-interaction study was performed with a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline). Subjects \nwith allergic rhinitis received oxymetazoline nasal spray one hour prior to Instanyl. Comparable \nbioavailability (AUC) of fentanyl was achieved with and without oxymetazoline, while fentanyl Cmax\ndecreased and Tmax increased by a factor two when oxymetazoline was administered. The overall \nextent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with allergic rhinitis without prior treatment with nasal \nvasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. Concomitant use of nasal vasoconstrictor \nshould be avoided (see section 4.5).\n\nBioequivalence\n\nA pharmacokinetic study has shown that Instanyl single-dose and multi-dose nasal spray are \nbioequivalent.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity,genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.\n\n\n\n23\n\nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect was observed at \nhigh doses (300 µg/kg/day, s.c.) and is consistent with the sedative effects of fentanyl in animal \nstudies. Furthermore, studies in female rats revealed reduced fertility and enhanced embryonal \nmortality. More recent studies showed that effects on the embryo were due to maternal toxicity and \nnot to direct effects of the substances on the developing embryo. In a study on pre- and postnatal \ndevelopment the survival rate of offspring was significantly reduced at doses which slightly reduced \nmaternal weight. This effect could either be due to altered maternal care or a direct effect of fentanyl \non the pups. Effects on somatic development and behaviour of the offspring were not observed. \nTeratogenic effects have not been demonstrated.\n\nLocal tolerance studies with Instanyl in mini-pigs demonstrated that Instanyl administration was well \ntolerated.\n\nCarcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year \nsubcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) with fentanyl did not reveal any findings indicative of \noncogenic potential. Evaluation of brain slides from the carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain \nlesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl citrate. The relevance of these findings to \nhumans is unknown.\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nNasal spray, solution (nasal spray). DoseGuard\nClear, colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nInstanyl is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in adults already receiving maintenance \nopioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transitory exacerbation of pain that \noccurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent pain.\nPatients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral \nmorphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg oxycodone \ndaily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week \nor longer.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of opioid therapy in cancer patients. Physicians should keep in mind the potential of \nabuse, misuse, addiction and overdose of fentanyl.\n\nPosology\n\nPatients should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable \nadverse drug reactions. Patients must be carefully monitored during the titration process. \nTitration to a higher dose necessitates contact with the health care professional. In absence of adequate \npain control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and progression of underlying disease should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n26\n\nThe dose of Instanyl for treatment of breakthrough pain was independent of the daily maintenance \ndose of opioid in the clinical studies (see section 5.1).\n\nMaximum daily dose: Treatment of up to four breakthrough pain episodes, each with no more than \ntwo doses separated by at least 10 minutes.\n\nPatients should wait 4 hours before treating another breakthrough pain episode with Instanyl during \nboth titration and maintenance therapy. On exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, \npatients can use Instanyl to treat it but they must wait at least 2 hours before doing so. Dose \nadjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered if the \npatient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or with \nmore than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours.\n\nDose titration\nBefore patients are titrated with Instanyl, it is expected that their background persistent pain is \ncontrolled by use of chronic opioid therapy and that they are experiencing no more than four episodes \nof breakthrough pain per day.\n\nMethod of titration\nThe initial strength should be one dose of 50 micrograms in one nostril, titrating upwards as necessary \nthrough the range of available strengths (50, 100, and 200 micrograms). If adequate analgesia is not \nachieved, redosing of the same strength may be administered at the earliest after 10 minutes. Each \ntitration step (dose strength) should be evaluated in several episodes.\n\nMaintenance therapy\nOnce the dose has been established according to the steps described above, the patient should be \nmaintained on this strength of Instanyl. If the patient has insufficient pain relief, redosing with the \nsame strength can be undertaken at the earliest after 10 minutes.\n\nDose adjustment\nGenerally, the maintenance strength of Instanyl should be increased when a patient requires more than \none dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes.\nDose adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered\nif the patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or \nwith more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours.\n\nStart at 50 micrograms\n\n- Use one dose of Instanyl\n- Wait 10 minutes\n\nDose obtained\n\nAdequate pain relief with one dose of Instanyl\n\nYes No\n\nRedose with same \nstrength. \nConsider next higher \nstrength for next episode\n\n\n\n27\n\nIf adverse reactions are intolerable or persistent, the strength should be reduced or treatment with \nInstanyl be replaced by other analgesics. \n\nDiscontinuation of therapy\nInstanyl should be discontinued immediately if the patient no longer experiences breakthrough pain \nepisodes. The treatment for the persistent background pain should be kept as prescribed. \nIf discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be closely followed by the \nphysician as gradual downward opioid titration is necessary in order to avoid the possibility of abrupt \nwithdrawal effects.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly and Cachectic population\nLimited data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety are available for the use of Instanyl in patients \nabove 65 years of age. Elderly patients may have a reduced clearance, a prolonged half-life and higher \nsensitivity to fentanyl than younger patients. Limited data on pharmacokinetics are available for the \nuse of fentanyl in cachectic (debilitated) patients. Cachectic patients may have reduced clearance of \nfentanyl. Caution should therefore be taken in treatment of elderly, cachectic or debilitated patients.\nIn clinical trials elderly patients tend to titrate to a lower effective strength than patients less than \n65 years of age. Particular caution should be exercised when titrating Instanyl in elderly patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nInstanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment \n(see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nInstanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Instanyl in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nInstanyl is intended for nasal use only.\nIt is recommended that the patient sit or stand in upright position when administrating Instanyl.\nCleaning of the nasal spray tip is required after each use.\n\nInstanyl incorporates an electronic dose counter, and a lock out period between doses to minimise the \nrisk of accidental overdose, misuse and abuse and to provide some reassurance to patients regarding \nthese risks. Following administration of two doses within 60 minutes, Instanyl will lock for a period of \n2 hours, from the first dose taken, before another dose can be administered.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\nBefore using Instanyl for the first time, the nasal spray must be primed. A priming sequence of 5 \nactuations of the nasal spray container is required, indicated by ‘P5’, ‘P4’, ‘P3’, ‘P2’ and ‘P1’ in the \ndisplay. \n\nIf the product has not been used for a period of more than 7 days, the nasal spray must be primed again, \nby actuating once before the next dose is taken, this is indicated by ‘P’ in the display.\n\nDuring the priming process product will be expelled. Therefore, the patient must be instructed that the \npriming should be conducted in a well ventilated area, pointing away from the patient and other people, \nand away from surfaces and objects that could come into contact with other people, particularly \nchildren.\n\n\n\n28\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nPatients without maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory depression.\nTreatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain.\nPatients being treated with medicinal products containing sodium oxybate.\nSevere respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions.\nPrevious facial radiotherapy.\nRecurrent episodes of epistaxis (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRespiratory depression\n\nClinically significant respiratory depression may occur with fentanyl, and patients must be observed \nfor these effects. Patients with pain who receive chronic opioid therapy develop tolerance to \nrespiratory depression and hence the risk of respiratory depression in these patients may be reduced. \nThe use of concomitant central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of respiratory \ndepression (see section 4.5).\n\nChronic pulmonary disease\n\nIn patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, fentanyl may have more severe adverse\nreactions. In these patients, opioids may decrease respiratory drive.\n\nImpaired renal or hepatic function\n\nFentanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic or renal \nimpairment. The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Instanyl have \nnot been evaluated; however, when administered intravenously the clearance of fentanyl has shown to \nbe altered due to hepatic and renal impairment caused by alterations in metabolic clearance and \nplasma proteins.\n\nIncreased intracranial pressure\n\nFentanyl should be used with caution in patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, \nimpaired consciousness or coma.\nInstanyl should be used with caution in patients with cerebral tumour or head injury.\n\nCardiac disease\n\nFentanyl use may be associated with bradycardia. Fentanyl should therefore be used with caution in \npatients with previous or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. Opioids may cause hypotension, especially in \npatients with hypovolaemia. Instanyl should therefore be used with caution in patients with \nhypotension and/or hypovolaemia.\n\nSerotonin syndrome\n\nCaution is advised when Instanyl is coadministered with medicinal products that affect the \nserotoninergic neurotransmitter systems.\n\nThe development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the concomitant \nuse of serotonergic medicinal products such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and \nSerotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and with medicinal products which impair \nmetabolism of serotonin (including Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [MAOIs]). This may occur within \nthe recommended dose.\n\n\n\n29\n\nSerotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), \nautonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \nabnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms \n(e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea).\n\nIf serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with Instanyl should be discontinued.\n\nHyperalgesia\n\nAs with other opioids, in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, \nthe possibility of opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated.\n\nNasal conditions\n\nIf the patient experiences recurrent episodes of epistaxis or nasal discomfort while taking Instanyl, an \nalternative administration form for treatment of breakthrough pain should be considered.\n\nCommon cold\n\nThe overall extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with common cold without prior treatment with \nnasal vasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. For concomitant use of nasal \nvasoconstrictor see section 4.5.\n\nAbuse potential and dependence\n\nTolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration \nof opioids such as fentanyl. However, iatrogenic addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is \nknown to occur in the treatment of cancer related pain.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms\n\nWithdrawal symptoms may be precipitated through the administration of substances with opioid \nantagonist activity, e.g. naloxone, or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic (e.g. pentazocine, \nbutorphanol, buprenorphine, nalbuphine).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nConcomitant use of medicinal products containing sodium oxybate and fentanyl is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nCoadministration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic agent, such as a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake \nInhibitor (SSRI) or a Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a Monoamine Oxidase \nInhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening \ncondition.\n\nInstanyl is not recommended for use in patients who have received Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors \n(MAOIs) within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAOIs inhibitors has been \nreported with opioid analgesics.\n\nFentanyl is metabolised mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), \ntherefore potential interactions may occur when Instanyl is given concurrently with medicinal products \nthat affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with medicinal products that induce 3A4 activity may \nreduce the efficacy of Instanyl. The concomitant use of Instanyl with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. \nritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, \n\n\n\n30\n\nand verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious \nadverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory depression.\nPatients receiving Instanyl concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be \ncarefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dose increase should be done with caution.\n\nIn a pharmacokinetic interaction study it was found that the maximum plasma concentration of nasally \napplied fentanyl was reduced about 50% by the concomitant use of oxymetazoline, while the time to \nreach Cmax (Tmax) was doubled. This may reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. It is recommended that \nconcomitant use of nasal decongestants is avoided (see section 5.2).\n\nThe concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants, (including opioids, sedatives,\nhypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers, sedating antihistamines and alcohol)\nand skeletal muscle relaxants, may produce additive depressant effects:\nhypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death may occur. Therefore, the use of any \nof these medicinal products concomitantly with Instanyl requires special patient care and observation.\n\nThe concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, \npentazocine) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low \nintrinsic activity and therefore partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce \nwithdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients.\n\nConcomitant use of Instanyl with other medicinal products (other than oxymetazoline) administered \nvia the nose has not been evaluated in the clinical trials. It is recommended that alternative \nadministration forms should be considered for concomitant treatment of concurrent diseases that can \nbe treated via nasal administration.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Instanyl \nshould not be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary and if the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFollowing long-term treatment, fentanyl may cause withdrawal in the new-born infant.\nIt is advised not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) because \nfentanyl passes through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the newborn (neonate). If \nInstanyl has been administered, an antidote for the child should be readily available.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nFentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breast-fed \nchild. Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breastfeeding should not be restarted \nuntil at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no human data on fertility available. In animal studies, male and female fertility was \nimpaired at sedative doses (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nopioid analgesics are known to impair the mental and/or physical ability required for driving or \noperating machinery. Patients undergoing treatment with Instanyl should be advised not to drive or \noperate machinery. Instanyl can cause somnolence, dizziness, visual disturbances or other adverse \nreactions which may affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.\n\n\n\n31\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nTypical opioid adverse reactions are to be expected with Instanyl. Frequently, most of these will cease \nor decrease in intensity with continued use of the medicinal product. The most serious adverse \nreactions are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory \ndepression, hypotension and shock and all patients should be closely monitored for these.\n\nThe adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly related to treatment in the clinical trials of \nInstanyl are included in the table below.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following categories are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency of occurrence: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1000); and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with Instanyl and/or other fentanyl-containing \ncompounds during clinical studies and post marketing experience:\n\nSystem organ class Common Uncommon Not known\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia Hallucination, drug \n\ndependence \n(addiction), drug \nabuse\n\nNervous system disorders Somnolence, \ndizziness, headache\n\nSedation, \nmyoclonus, \nparaesthesia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndysgeusia\n\nConvulsions, loss of \nconsciousness\n\nEar and Labyrinth disorders Vertigo Motion sickness\nCardiac disorders Hypotension\nVascular disorders Flushing, hot flush\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nThroat irritation Respiratory \ndepression, \nepistaxis, nasal \nulcer, rhinorrhea\n\nNasal septum \nperforation, \ndyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea, vomiting Constipation, \nstomatitis, dry \nmouth\n\nDiarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nHyperhidrosis Pain of skin, pruritus\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nPyrexia Fatigue, malaise \nperipheral oedema, \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome*, neonatal \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nFall\n\n*opioid withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating have \nbeen observed with transmucosal fentanyl.\n\n\n\n32\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of fentanyl overdose are expected to be an extension of its pharmacological \nactions e.g. lethargy, coma and severe respiratory depression. Other signs may be hypothermia, \ndecreased muscle tonus, bradycardia and hypotension. Signs of toxicity are deep sedation, ataxia, \nmiosis, convulsions and respiratory depression, which is the main symptom.\n\nTreatment\n\nFor management of respiratory depression immediate countermeasures should be started including \nphysical or verbal stimulation of the patient. These actions can be followed by administration of a \nspecific opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Respiratory depression following an overdose may outlast \nthe duration of action of the opioid antagonist. The half-life of the antagonist may be short, therefore \nrepeated administration or continuous infusion may be necessary. Reversal of the narcotic effect may \nresult in acute onset of pain and release of catecholamines.\n\nIf the clinical situation warrants, a patent airway should be established and maintained, possibly with \nan oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube and oxygen should be administered and respiration \nassisted or controlled, as appropriate. Adequate body temperature and fluid intake should be \nmaintained.\n\nIf severe or persistent hypotension occurs, hypovolemia should be considered and the condition should \nbe managed with appropiate parenteral fluid therapy.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, opioids, ATC code: N02AB03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nFentanyl is an opioid analgesic interacting primarily with the opioid μ-receptor as a pure agonist with \nlow affinity for the - and κ-opioid receptors. The primary therapeutic action is analgesia. The \nsecondary pharmacological effects are respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypothermia, constipation, \nmiosis, physical dependence and euphoria.\n\nClinical safety and efficacy\n\nThe efficacy and safety of Instanyl (50, 100 and 200 micrograms) have been assessed in two \nrandomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled pivotal studies in 279 opioid-tolerant adult \ncancer patients (age 32-86 years) with breakthrough pain (BTP). The patients had an average of 1 to \n4 episodes per day while taking maintenance opioid therapy. Patients in the second pivotal study had \nearlier participated in the Instanyl pharmacokinetic study or in the first pivotal study.\n\nThe clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Instanyl. No distinct correlation between \nthe maintenance opioid dose and Instanyl doses have been established, however in the second pivotal \n\n\n\n33\n\nstudy patients receiving low maintenance opioid dose tended to achieve effective pain relief with a \nlower strength of Instanyl compared to patients taking higher levels of maintenance opioid dose. This\nobservation was most distinct for patients receiving Instanyl 50 micrograms.\nIn the clinical studies in cancer patients, the most frequent strengths used were 100 and \n200 micrograms; however, patients should be titrated to the optimal dose of Instanyl for treating BTP \nin cancer (see section 4.2).\n\nAll three strengths of Instanyl demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.001) higher pain intensity \ndifference at 10 minutes (PID10) compared with placebo. Furthermore, Instanyl was significantly \nsuperior to placebo in BTP relief at 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes following administration. The results of \nsummary of PID at 60 minutes (SPID0-60) showed that all strengths of Instanyl had significantly higher \nmean SPID0-60 scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) demonstrating better pain relief of Instanyl \ncompared to placebo during 60 minutes.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Instanyl have been evaluated in patients taking the medicinal product at the \nonset of a breakthrough pain episode. Instanyl should not be used pre-emptively.\n\nThe clinical experience with Instanyl in patients with background opioid treatment equivalent to \n≥ 500 mg/day morphine or ≥ 200 micrograms/hour transdermal fentanyl is limited.\n\nInstanyl in doses above 400 micrograms have not been evaluated in clinical trials.\n\nOpioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or –gonadal axes. Some changes that can be \nseen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical \nsigns and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nFentanyl is highly lipophilic. Fentanyl exhibits three compartment distribution kinetics. Animal data \nshows that following absorption, fentanyl is rapidly distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and \nspleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles and fat. The plasma protein binding of fentanyl \nis approximately 80. The absolute bioavailability of Instanyl is approximately 89.\nClinical data show that fentanyl is absorbed very rapidly through the nasal mucosa. Administration of \nInstanyl in single doses ranging from 50 to 200 micrograms fentanyl per dose in opioid tolerant cancer \npatients produces a rapid Cmax level of 0.35 to 1.2 ng/ml. The corresponding median Tmax are \n12-15 minutes. However, higher values for Tmax were observed in a dose-proportionality study in \nhealthy volunteers.\n\nDistribution\n\nAfter intravenous administration of fentanyl the initial distribution half-life is approximately 6 minutes \nand a similar half-life is seen after the nasal administration of Instanyl. The elimination half-life is \napproximately 3-4 hours for Instanyl in cancer patients.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nFentanyl is metabolised primarily in the liver via CYP3A4. The major metabolite, norfentanyl is \ninactive. \n\nElimination\n\nAbout 75 of fentanyl is excreted into the urine, mostly as inactive metabolites, with less than 10 as \nunchanged active substance. About 9 of the dose is recovered in the faeces primarily as metabolites.\n\n\n\n34\n\nLinearity\n\nInstanyl shows linear kinetics. Dose linearity from 50 micrograms to 400 micrograms of Instanyl has \nbeen demonstrated in healthy subjects.\nA drug-drug-interaction study was performed with a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline). Subjects \nwith allergic rhinitis received oxymetazoline nasal spray one hour prior to Instanyl. Comparable \nbioavailability (AUC) of fentanyl was achieved with and without oxymetazoline, while fentanyl Cmax\ndecreased and Tmax increased by a factor two when oxymetazoline was administered. The overall \nextent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with allergic rhinitis without prior treatment with nasal \nvasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. Concomitant use of nasal vasoconstrictor \nshould be avoided (see section 4.5).\n\nBioequivalence\n\nA pharmacokinetic study has shown that Instanyl single-dose and multi-dose nasal spray are \nbioequivalent.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity,genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.\n\nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect was observed at \nhigh doses (300 µg/kg/day, s.c.) and is consistent with the sedative effects of fentanyl in animal \nstudies. Furthermore, studies in female rats revealed reduced fertility and enhanced embryonal \nmortality. More recent studies showed that effects on the embryo were due to maternal toxicity and \nnot to direct effects of the substances on the developing embryo. In a study on pre- and postnatal \ndevelopment the survival rate of offspring was significantly reduced at doses which slightly reduced \nmaternal weight. This effect could either be due to altered maternal care or a direct effect of fentanyl \non the pups. Effects on somatic development and behaviour of the offspring were not observed. \nTeratogenic effects have not been demonstrated.\n\nLocal tolerance studies with Instanyl in mini-pigs demonstrated that Instanyl administration was well \ntolerated.\n\nCarcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year \nsubcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) with fentanyl did not reveal any findings indicative of \noncogenic potential. Evaluation of brain slides from the carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain \nlesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl citrate. The relevance of these findings to \nhumans is unknown.\n\n6.

What Instanyl is and what it is used for\n\nInstanyl contains the active substance fentanyl and belongs to a group of strong painkillers called \nopioids. Opioids act by blocking the pain signals to the brain. \nInstanyl acts rapidly and is used for relieving breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients already treated \nwith opioids for their usual pain. Breakthrough pain is an additional sudden pain that occurs despite \nyou having taken your usual opioid pain relieving medicines.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Instanyl\n\nDo not use Instanyl\n- if you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, \n\nhydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least \na week, to control your persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not \nuse Instanyl, because it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow \nand/or shallow, or even stop.\n\n- If you are taking a medicine which contains sodium oxybate.\n- if you suffer from short-term pain other than breakthrough pain.\n- if you have serious difficulties breathing or suffer from a serious obstructive lung disease.\n- if you have previously received facial radiotherapy.\n- if you suffer from recurrent episodes of nose bleeding.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before using Instanyl, especially:\n- if you suffer from a long-term obstructive lung disease, your breathing may be impaired by \n\nInstanyl.\n\n\n\n87\n\n- if you have problems with your heart especially slow heart rate, low blood pressure or low \nblood volume.\n\n- if you have problems with your liver or kidneys.\n- if you have problems with your brain function, e.g. due to a brain tumour, a head injury or \n\nincreased intracranial pressure.\n- if you have ever developed adrenal insufficiency or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) \n\nwith opioid use.\n- if you take antidepressants or antipsychotics, please refer to the section ‘Other medicines and \n\nInstanyl’.\n- if you take medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and \n\npentazocine (medicines for treatment of pain) as you may experience symptoms of withdrawal \nsyndrome. Please refer to the section Other medicines and Instanyl for more information.\n\n- if you use other nasal spray products, e.g. for common cold or allergy.\n\nIf you experience difficulties breathing while being treated with Instanyl, it is very important \nthat you contact your doctor or hospital immediately.\n\nConsult your doctor while using Instanyl, if:\n- you experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a\n\nhigher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor.\n- you experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, \n\nweakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a \npotentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the \nadrenal glands do not produce enough hormones.\n\nIf you experience recurrent nose bleeding or nasal discomfort whilst being treated with Instanyl, you \nmust contact your doctor, who will consider alternative treatment for your breakthrough pain.\n\nIf you think you are becoming dependent on Instanyl, it is important that you inform you doctor.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nInstanyl should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Instanyl\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nInstanyl may affect or be affected by other medicines.\nSpecial care should be taken if you are treated with any of the following medicines:\n- any medicines which might normally make you sleepy (have a sedative effect) such as sleeping \n\npills, medicines to treat anxiety, antihistamines, or tranquillisers. The use of such other drugs at \nthe same time as Instanyl, may cause deep sedation and affect your ability to breath, which may \nlead to coma and be life-threatening.\n\n- any medicines that might have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down Instanyl, \nsuch as:\n ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and fosamprenavir (medicines that help control HIV \n\ninfection);\n CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole (used for treatment \n\nof fungal infections);\n troleandomycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin (medicines for treatment of bacterial \n\ninfections);\n aprepitant (used to treat severe nausea);\n diltiazem and verapamil (medicines for treatment of high blood pressure or heart \n\ndiseases).\n- medicines called Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) used for severe depression, even if \n\nyou have been treated with one in the past 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n88\n\n- The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or \nantipsychotics. Instanyl may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental \nstatus changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature \nabove 38 °C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, \nmuscular rigidity, lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea). Your doctor will tell you whether Instanyl is suitable for you.\n\n- medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine \n(medicines for treatment of pain). You could experience symptoms of withdrawal syndrome\n(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating).\n\n- other medicines taken via the nose, especially oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and similar \nmedicines, which are used for relief of nose congestions.\n\nInstanyl with food, drink and alcohol\nDo not drink alcohol whilst being treated with Instanyl, as it can increase the risk of experiencing \ndangerous side effects.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nInstanyl should not be used during pregnancy unless you have discussed this with your doctor.\n\nInstanyl should not be used during childbirth because fentanyl may cause serious breathing problems \nin the new-born child.\n\nFentanyl can get into breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed infant. Do not use\nInstanyl if you are breast-feeding. You should not start breast-feeding until at least 5 days after the \nlast dose of Instanyl.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou should not drive or use machinery whilst being treated with Instanyl. Instanyl can cause \ndizziness, drowsiness and visual disturbances, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\n3. How to use Instanyl\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\nThe dose of Instanyl is independent of your usual cancer pain treatment.\n\nWhen you first start using Instanyl, your doctor will work with you to find the dose that will relieve \nyour breakthrough pain.\nThe initial dose is one puff of 50 micrograms in one nostril each time you have an episode of \nbreakthrough pain. During the determination of your right dose, your doctor may instruct you to \nchange to a higher dose. \n\nIf your breakthrough pain is not relieved after 10 minutes, you may use only one puff more for this \nepisode.\nGenerally you should wait 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain. On \nexceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, you can use Instanyl to treat it but you must \nwait at least 2 hours before doing so. If you regularly have breakthrough pain episodes that are less \nthan 4 hours apart, contact your doctor as your usual cancer pain treatment may have to be changed.\n\nYou can use Instanyl to treat up to four episodes of breakthrough pain per day.\n\n\n\n89\n\nIf you experience more than four episodes of breakthrough pain per day, contact your doctor, as your \nusual cancer pain treatment may have to be changed.\n\nIn order to keep track of the number of doses of Instanyl used, you should use the tick-boxes in the \nbooklet placed on top of the child-resistant outer box.\n\nDo not change the dose of Instanyl or your other pain medicines on your own. Change in dose must be \ndone together with your doctor.\n\nInstanyl is for nasal use.\n\nPlease read the instruction for use at the end of this leaflet to learn how to use Instanyl.\n\nIf you use more Instanyl than you should or if you think someone has accidentally used Instanyl\nYou should contact your doctor, hospital or emergency room for assessment of the risk and for advice \nif you have taken more Instanyl than you should.\n\nSymptoms of overdose are:\nSleepiness, drowiness, dizziness, reduced body temperature, slow heart beat, difficulties coordinating \narms and legs.\nIn serious cases taking too much Instanyl may cause coma, sedation, convulsions or severe breathing \ndifficulties (very slow or shallow breathing).\nIf you feel any of the above symptoms you should seek immediate medical assistance.\n\nNote to carers\nIf you see the person taking Instanyl suddenly acting slowly, having difficulties breathing or if you \nhave difficulties waking the person up:\n- you should immediately call for emergency help.\n- while waiting for the emergency help, you must try to keep the person awake by talking to or \n\ngently shaking the person every now and then.\n- if the person has difficulty breathing, you should prompt the person to breathe in every \n\n5-10 seconds.\n- if the person has stopped breathing, you should attempt to resuscitate her/him until emergency \n\nhelp arrives.\n\nIf you think someone has accidentally taken Instanyl, please seek immediate medical assistance. Try to \nkeep the person awake until emergency help arrives.\nIf someone has accidentally taken Instanyl, they may have the same symptoms as described above for \noverdose.\n\nIf you forget to use Instanyl\nIf the breakthrough pain is still ongoing, you may take Instanyl as prescribed by your doctor. If the \nbreakthrough pain has stopped, do not take Instanyl until the next episode of breakthrough pain occurs.\n\nIf you stop using Instanyl\nYou should discontinue Instanyl when you no longer have any breakthrough pain. You should \nhowever continue to take your usual pain relieving medicine to treat your cancer pain. Contact your \ndoctor to confirm the correct dose of your usual medicine if you are not sure.\nYou may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to the possible side effects of Instanyl when \ndiscontinuing Instanyl. If you experience withdrawal symptoms, you should contact your doctor. Your \ndoctor will evaluate if you need medicine to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n\n\n90\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\nThe side effects will often stop or reduce in intensity with continued use of the product.\n\nDiscontinue the treatment and contact your doctor, hospital or emergency room immediately, if \nyou:\n- experience severe breathing difficulties.\n- have a rattling sound when you breathe in.\n- have convulsive pain.\n- experience extreme dizziness.\nThese side effects can be very serious.\n\nOther side effects reported after use of Instanyl:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\nSleepiness, dizziness even with difficulties keeping balance, headache, irritation of the throat, nausea, \nvomiting, flushing, feeling very warm, excessive sweating.\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\nSleeplessness, drowsiness, convulsive muscle contractions, abnormal sensation of the skin even \nunpleasant, change of taste, motion sickness, low blood pressure, severe breathing problems, nose \nbleeds, nasal ulcer, runny nose, constipation, inflammation of the mouth, dry mouth, skin pain, itching \nof the skin, fever.\n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):\nFall, diarrhoea, convulsions (fits), loss of consciousness, swelling of arms or legs, seeing or hearing \nthings that are not really there (hallucinations), drug dependence (addiction), drug abuse, fatigue, \nmalaise, withdrawal syndrome (may manifest by the occurrence of the following side effects nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating), shortness of breath.\n\nThere have also been reports of patients developing a hole in the septum of the nose – the structure, \nwhich separates the nostrils.\n\nProlonged treatment with fentanyl during pregnancy may cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn \nwhich can be life-threatening (see section 2)\n\nYou should tell your doctor if you experience recurrent episodes of nose bleeding or nasal discomfort.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Therefore:\n\n Priming should be performed in a well ventilated area.\n Do not point the nasal spray in the direction of yourself and other people.\n Do not point in the direction of surfaces and objects that could come into contact \n\nwith other people, particularly children.\n- If you have not used Instanyl for more than 7 days the pump must be primed again by spraying \n\nonce before the next dose is taken.\n\nInstanyl nasal spray should be used in the following way:\n1. Blow your nose if it feels blocked or you have a cold.\n2. You should sit or stand in upright position.\n3. Remove the protective cap from the spray.\n\n4. Hold the nasal spray upright.\n5. Bend your head slightly forward.\n6. Close one nostril by placing your finger against the side of your nose and insert the spray tip into \n\nthe other nostril (approximately 1 cm). It does not matter which nostril you use. If you have to \ntake a second dose after 10 minutes to get sufficient pain relief, this dose should be taken in the \nother nostril.\n\n7. Press the pump down quickly and completely with two fingers, once, while breathing in through \nyour nose. You must make sure the pump is pressed all the way down. You may not feel the dose\nin your nose, but you have received it when you have pressed the pump.\n\n8. Clean the nasal spray tip after use with a clean tissue, and then throw away the tissue afterwards.\n\n\n\n95\n\nIf after 10 minutes you need a second dose of Instanyl to relieve your pain, repeat steps 1 to 8 in the \nother nostril.\n\nAlways place Instanyl in the child-resistant box after use. Keep out of the sight and reach of \nchildren.\n\nKeep track of how many doses you have used and how many you have left in your nasal spray by \nusing the dose-counting card provided with Instanyl nasal spray. Every time you use Instanyl nasal \nspray, make sure you or your carer fills in the information on the card.\n\nIf Instanyl nasal spray is blocked or does not spray properly:\n If it is blocked, aim the nasal spray away from you (and any other people) and push firmly down \n\non the pump. This should clear any blockage. \n If your nasal spray is still not working properly, talk to your pharmacist. Never try to fix the \n\nnasal spray yourself or take it apart. This is because it may then give you the wrong dose. \n\n\n\n96\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nInstanyl 50 micrograms nasal spray, solution in single-dose container\nInstanyl 100 micrograms nasal spray, solution in single-dose container\nInstanyl 200 micrograms nasal spray, solution in single-dose container\n\nfentanyl\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet.

What Instanyl is and what it is used for\n\nInstanyl contains the active substance fentanyl and belongs to a group of strong painkillers called \nopioids. Opioids act by blocking the pain signals to the brain. \nInstanyl acts rapidly and is used for relieving breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients already treated \nwith opioids for their usual pain. Breakthrough pain is an additional sudden pain that occurs despite \nyou having taken your usual opioid pain relieving medicines.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Instanyl\n\nDo not use Instanyl\n- if you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, \n\nhydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least \na week, to control your persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not \nuse Instanyl, because it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow \nand/or shallow, or even stop.\n\n- If you are taking a medicine which contains sodium oxybate.\n- if you suffer from short-term pain other than breakthrough pain.\n- if you have serious difficulties breathing or suffer from a serious obstructive lung disease.\n- if you have previously received facial radiotherapy.\n- if you suffer from recurrent episodes of nose bleeding.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before using Instanyl, especially:\n- if you suffer from a long-term obstructive lung disease, your breathing may be impaired by \n\nInstanyl.\n- if you have problems with your heart especially slow heart rate, low blood pressure or low \n\nblood volume.\n\n\n\n106\n\n- if you have problems with your liver or kidneys.\n- if you have problems with your brain function, e.g. due to a brain tumour, a head injury or \n\nincreased intracranial pressure.\n- if you have ever developed adrenal insufficiency or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) \n\nwith opioid use.\n- if you take antidepressants or antipsychotics, please refer to the section ‘Other medicines and \n\nInstanyl’.\n- if you take medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and \n\npentazocine (medicines for treatment of pain) as you may experience symptoms of withdrawal \nsyndrome. Please refer to the section Other medicines and Instanyl for more information.\n\n- if you use other nasal spray products, e.g. for common cold or allergy.\n\nIf you experience difficulties breathing while being treated with Instanyl, it is very important \nthat you contact your doctor or hospital immediately.\n\nConsult your doctor while using Instanyl, if:\n- you experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a \n\nhigher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor.\n- you experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, \n\nweakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a \npotentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the \nadrenal glands do not produce enough hormones.\n\nIf you experience recurrent nose bleeding or nasal discomfort whilst being treated with Instanyl, you \nmust contact your doctor, who will consider alternative treatment for your breakthrough pain.\n\nIf you think you are becoming dependent on Instanyl, it is important that you inform you doctor.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nInstanyl should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Instanyl\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nInstanyl may affect or be affected by other medicines.\nSpecial care should be taken if you are treated with any of the following medicines:\n- any medicines which might normally make you sleepy (have a sedative effect) such as sleeping \n\npills, medicines to treat anxiety, antihistamines, or tranquillisers. The use of such other drugs at \nthe same time as Instanyl, may cause deep sedation and affect your ability to breath, which may \nlead to coma and be life-threatening.\n\n- any medicines that might have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down Instanyl, \nsuch as:\n ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and fosamprenavir (medicines that help control HIV \n\ninfection);\n CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole (used for treatment \n\nof fungal infections);\n troleandomycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin (medicines for treatment of bacterial \n\ninfections);\n aprepitant (used to treat severe nausea);\n diltiazem and verapamil (medicines for treatment of high blood pressure or heart \n\ndiseases).\n- medicines called Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) used for severe depression, even if \n\nyou have been treated with one in the past 2 weeks.\n- The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or \n\nantipsychotics. Instanyl may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental \nstatus changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature \n\n\n\n107\n\nabove 38 °C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, \nmuscular rigidity, lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea). Your doctor will tell you whether Instanyl is suitable for you.\n\n- medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine \n(medicines for treatment of pain). You could experience symptoms of withdrawal syndrome \n(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating).\n\n- Other medicines taken via the nose, especially oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and similar \nmedicines, which are used for relief of nose congestions.\n\nInstanyl with food, drink and alcohol\nDo not drink alcohol whilst being treated with Instanyl, as it can increase the risk of experiencing \ndangerous side effects.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nInstanyl should not be used during pregnancy unless you have discussed this with your doctor.\n\nInstanyl should not be used during childbirth because fentanyl may cause serious breathing problems \nin the new-born child.\n\nFentanyl can get into breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed infant. Do not use \nInstanyl if you are breast-feeding. You should not start breast-feeding until at least 5 days after the \nlast dose of Instanyl.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou should not drive or use machinery whilst being treated with Instanyl. Instanyl can cause \ndizziness, drowsiness and visual disturbances, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\n3.
