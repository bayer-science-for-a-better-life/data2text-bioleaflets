CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReplacement therapy of adrenal insufficiency in infants, children and adolescents (from birth to < 18 \nyears old). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nDosage must be individualised according to the response of the individual patient. The lowest possible \ndosage should be used. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nMonitoring of the clinical response is necessary and patients should be observed closely for signs that \nmight require dosage adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or \nexacerbations of the disease, individual responsiveness to the medicinal product, and the effect of \nstress (e.g. surgery, infection, trauma). During stress it may be necessary to increase the dose \ntemporarily.  \n \nReplacement therapy in primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency \nAlkindi is given as replacement therapy by oral administration of granules according to clinical \npractice, in a dose to be titrated against individual clinical response.  \n \nRecommended replacement doses of hydrocortisone are 8-10 mg/m2/day for patients with adrenal \ninsufficiency alone and 10-15 mg/m2/day in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), \ntypically in three or four divided doses.  \n \nIn patients with some remaining endogenous cortisol production a lower dose may be sufficient.  \n \nIn situations when the body is exposed to excessive physical and/or mental stress, patients may need \nan increased dose, especially in the afternoon or evening. \n \nPre-operatively, during serious trauma or illness in patients with known adrenal insufficiency or \ndoubtful adrenal reserve \nPre-operatively, anaesthetists must be informed if the patient is taking corticosteroids or has \npreviously taken corticosteroids. \n \nIn less severe situations when parenteral administration of hydrocortisone is not required, for instance \nlow grade infections, moderate fever of any aetiology and stressful situations such as minor surgical \nprocedures, there should be high awareness of the risk of developing acute adrenal insufficiency, and \nthe normal oral daily replacement dose should be increased temporarily; the Alkindi total daily dose \nshould be increased by doubling or tripling the usual dose. Once the intercurrent illness episode is \nover, patients can return to the normal replacement dose of Alkindi. \n \nIn severe situations, an increase in dose is immediately required and oral administration of \nhydrocortisone must be replaced with parenteral treatment. Parenteral administration of \nhydrocortisone is warranted during transient illness episodes such as severe infections, in particular \ngastroenteritis associated with vomiting and/or diarrhoea, high fever of any aetiology or extensive \nphysical stress, such as for instance serious accidents and surgery under general anaesthesia. Where \nparenteral hydrocortisone is required, the patient should be treated in a facility with resuscitation \nfacilities in case of evolving adrenal crisis. \n \nChanging from conventional oral glucocorticoid treatment to Alkindi  \nWhen changing patients from conventional oral hydrocortisone replacement therapy to Alkindi, an \nidentical total daily dose may be given. Alkindi is therapeutically equivalent to conventional \nhydrocortisone tablets. \n \nMethod of administration  \nThe granules must be given orally and should not be chewed. The capsule shell must not be swallowed \nbut carefully be opened as follows: \n \n- The capsule is held so that the printed strength is at the top, and tapped to ensure all the granules \n\nare in the lower half of the capsule. \n- The bottom of the capsule is gently squeezed.  \n- The top of the capsule is twisted off. \n- The granules are either poured directly onto the child\u2019s tongue, or the granules are poured onto a \n\nspoon and placed in the child\u2019s mouth. For children who are able to take soft food, the granules \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nmay be sprinkled onto a spoonful of cold or room temperature soft food (such as yoghurt or fruit \npuree) and given immediately. \n\n- Whichever method is used, the capsule is tapped to ensure all the granules are removed.  \n \nImmediately after administration a drink such as water, milk, breast-milk, or formula-milk should be \ngiven to help ensure all granules are swallowed. \n \nIf the granules are sprinkled onto a spoonful of soft food this should be given immediately (within 5 \nminutes) and not stored for future use. \n \nThe granules must not be added to liquid as this can result in less than the full dose being given, and \nmay affect the taste masking which will allow the bitter taste of hydrocortisone to become apparent.  \n \nDo not administer via nasogastric tube as there is a risk of nasogastric tube blockage. \n \nDetailed pictograms on how to administer the granules are provided in the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPatients with dysphagia or premature infants where oral feeding has not been established. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAdrenal crisis \nWhere a child is vomiting or acutely unwell parenteral hydrocortisone should be started without delay, \ncarers should be trained in adminstering this in an emergency. \n \nSudden discontinuation of therapy with Alkindi risks triggering an adrenal crisis and death. Medicinal \nproduct-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid a withdrawal of \ncorticosteroids and may be minimised by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative \ninsufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of \nstress occurring during that period, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstated. \n \nInfections and immunisation \nReplacement schedules of corticosteroids for people with adrenal insufficiency do not cause \nimmunosuppression and are not, therefore, contraindications for administration of live vaccines. \n \nInfection should not be more likely at a replacement dose of hydrocortisone, but all infections should \nbe treated seriously and stress dosing of steroid initiated early (see section 4.2). Patients with adrenal \ninsufficiency are at risk of life-threatening adrenal crisis during infection so clinical suspicion of \ninfection should be high and specialist advice should be sought early. \n \nUndesirable effects of corticosteroid replacement therapy \nMost undesirable effects of corticosteroids are dose and duration of exposure related. Undesirable \neffects are therefore less likely when using corticosteroids as replacement therapy. \n \nCorticosteroids may cause growth retardation in infancy, childhood and adolescence; this may be \nirreversible. Treatment should be limited to the minimum dosage required to achieve desired clinical \nresponse and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Excessive weight \ngain with decreased height velocity or other symptoms or signs of Cushing syndrome indicate \nexcessive glucocorticoid replacement. Infants require frequent assessment and should be evaluated at a \nminimum every 3 to 4 months to assess growth, blood pressure, and general well-being. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nBone mineral density may be impacted in children when higher doses of replacement steroids are \nused. The lowest appropriate dose of steroid according to the response of the individual patient should \nbe used. \n \nPatients/and or carers should be warned that potentially severe psychiatric adverse reactions; euphoria, \nmania, psychosis with hallucinations and delirium have been seen in adult patients at replacement \ndoses of hydrocortisone (see section 4.8). Symptoms typically emerge within a few days or weeks of \nstarting the treatment. Risks may be higher with high doses/systemic exposure (see also section 4.5), \nalthough dose levels do not allow prediction of the onset, type, severity or duration of reactions. Most \nreactions recover after either dose reduction or withdrawal, although specific treatment may be \nnecessary. Patients/carers should be encouraged to seek medical advice if worrying psychological \nsymptoms develop, especially if depressed mood or suicidal ideation is suspected. Patients/carers \nshould also be alert to possible psychiatric disturbances that may occur either during or immediately \nafter dose tapering/withdrawal of systemic steroids, although such reactions have been reported \ninfrequently. \n \nRare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids, \nespecially when a patient has a history of allergies to medicinal products. \n \nVisual disturbance \nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents \nwith symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for \nreferral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma \nor rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy which have been reported after use of \nsystemic and topical corticosteroids. \n \nExcretion of granules \nThe granules may sometimes be seen in stools since the centre of the granule is not absorbed in the gut \nafter it has released the active substance. This does not mean the medicinal product has been \nineffective and the patient should not take another dose for this reason. \n \nNasogastric tube feeding \nAlkindi granules are not suitable for nasogastric administration as they may cause tube blockage.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nHydrocortisone is metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of \nmedicinal products that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may therefore lead to unwanted \nalterations in serum concentrations of Alkindi with the risk of adverse effects, particularly adrenal \ncrisis. The need for dose adjustment when such medicinal products are used can be anticipated and \npatients should be closely monitored. \n \nMedicinal products inducing CYP3A4, requiring a potential increase in Alkindi dosing, include but \nare not limited to: \n \n- Anticonvulsants: phenytoin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine \n- Antibiotics: rifampicin and rifabutin \n- Barbiturates including phenobarbital and primidone \n- Antiretroviral medicinal products: efavirenz and nevirapine \n \nMedicinal products/substances inhibiting CYP3A4, requiring a potential decrease in Alkindi dosing, \ninclude but are not limited to: \n \n- Anti-fungals: itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole \n- Antibiotics: erythromycin  and clarithromycin  \n- Antiretroviral medicinal products: ritonavir  \n- Grapefruit juice \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n- Liquorice \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nHydrocortisone for replacement therapy can be used during pregnancy The ability of corticosteroids to \ncross the placenta varies between the different types of corticosteroids, however, hydrocortisone \nreadily crosses the placenta.  \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity of corticosteroids (see section 5.3) \n \nBreast-feeding \nHydrocortisone for replacement therapy can be used during breast-feeding.  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data available for possible effects of Alkindi on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlkindi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nA total of 30 healthy (but dexamethasone-suppressed) adult male subjects in two phase 1 studies and \n24 paediatric patients with adrenal insufficiency in two phase 3 studies have been treated with Alkindi. \nThere were no adverse reactions and no episodes of adrenal crisis seen in any of the studies. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported in the scientific literature in adult patients for \nother hydrocortisone medicinal products when given as adrenal insufficiency replacement therapy \nwith frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nMedDRA system organ class Frequency: not known \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n \n\nPsychosis with hallucinations and delirium \nMania \nEuphoria \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\nGastritis \nNausea  \n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n \n\nHypokalaemic alkalosis \n\n \nHistorical cohorts of adults treated from childhood for CAH have been found to have reduced bone \nmineral density and increased fracture rates and growth retardation (see section 4.4) - it is unclear if \nthese relate to hydrocortisone therapy using current replacement regimens. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of acute toxicity and/or deaths following hydrocortisone overdose are rare. No antidote is \navailable. Treatment is probably not indicated for reactions due to chronic poisoning unless the patient \nhas a condition that would render him/her unusually susceptible to ill effects from hydrocortisone. In \nwhich case, symptomatic treatment should be instituted as necessary. \n \nThe biological half-life of hydrocortisone is about 100 minutes. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids for systemic use; Glucocorticoids. ATC code: H02AB09 \n \nMechanism of action \nHydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are adrenocortical steroids, both \nnaturally-occurring and synthetic, which are readily absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nHydrocortisone is believed to be the principal corticosteroid secreted by the adrenal cortex. \nNaturally-occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining \nproperties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. They are also used for \ntheir potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids cause \nprofound and varied metabolic effects. In addition they modify the body\u2019s immune responses to \ndiverse stimuli. \n \nClinical efficacy  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pivotal study was an open-label single-dose single-centre trial in 24 paediatric patients aged less \nthan 6 years requiring replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency due to CAH, primary adrenal \nfailure or hypopituitarism. The study consisted of three consecutive cohorts, the first including 12 \npatients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the second including 6 patients aged 28 days to less than 2 years, \nand the third including 6 neonates aged from birth to less than 28 days.  \n \nOf these 24 patients, 23 had a diagnosis of CAH and 1 had a diagnosis of hypopituitarism including \nhypothyroidism. 1 patient had renal hypoplasia, 1 patient atopic dermatitis and 1 patient had rhinitis. \nThe study used a single dose of Alkindi granules equivalent to the previous morning\u2019s dose of each \npatient\u2019s usual glucocorticoid treatment. The Alkindi dose range administered was 1 mg - 4 mg. \nParents/carers (and where possible children) assessed the palatability of Alkindi after administration \nusing a 5-item Likert scale. \n \nAs this was a single-dose study, the primary efficacy assessment was serum cortisol at 60 minutes. In \nall 24 patients Alkindi was found to increase cortisol values from baseline as expected: median \nbaseline cortisol 14.1 mmol/l (range 14.1 - 104.5), median Cmax 535.2 mmol/l (range 346.2 - 1445.1). \n \nAlkindi was positively assessed in terms of palatability. Among parents and carers asked about their \nchild\u2019s experience of taking the medication (n=23), 82.6% agreed/strongly agreed that their child \nfound swallowing Alkindi easy; 65.2% agreed/strongly agreed that their child showed a positive \nreaction after Alkindi administration; 95.5% would be happy to give their child Alkindi in the future; \nand 95.5% said that they would prefer Alkindi for their child\u2019s treatment over their usual \nhydrocortisone formulation. Six of the 12 children in Cohort 1 (age range 2.6 to 4.7 years) responded \nto an adjusted palatability questionnaire. \u226550% subjects reported that the taste, feel in mouth and ease \nof swallowing were very good and that they were likely to take the medicinal product again. 68.8% of \nhealthy adult volunteers have described the taste as neutral. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral administration, hydrocortisone is rapidly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and \nthe oral Alkindi 4x5 mg was approximately 87 % bioavailable when compared to intravenous \nhydrocortisone in dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult male volunteers. \n \nThe coadministration of Alkindi with soft food (yoghurt and fruit puree) has been studied in vitro with \nno significant effect on dissolution seen.  \n \nDistribution \n90% or more of circulating hydrocortisone is reversibly bound to protein. \n \nThe binding is accounted for by two protein fractions. One, corticosteroid-binding globulin is a \nglycoprotein; the other is albumin. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nHydrocortisone is metabolised in the liver and most body tissues to hydrogenated and degraded forms \nsuch as tetrahydrocortisone and tetrahydrocortisol which are excreted in the urine, mainly conjugated \nas glucuronides, together with a very small proportion of unchanged hydrocortisone. \n \nThe terminal half-life of hydrocortisone is about 1.5 hours following intravenous and oral dosing of \nhydrocortisone tablets and Alkindi in dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult male volunteers. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of fetal development \nincluding cleft palate, intrauterine growth retardation and effects on brain growth and development. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as those of the child for whom this medicine has \nbeen prescribed  \n\n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Alkindi is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you give Alkindi \n3. How to give Alkindi  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Alkindi  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Alkindi is and what it is used for \n \nAlkindi contains a medicine called hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone belongs to a group of medicines \nknown as corticosteroids. \n \nHydrocortisone is a synthetic version of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is made naturally by the \nadrenal glands in the body. Alkindi is used when the body is not making enough cortisol, because part \nof the adrenal gland is not working (adrenal insufficiency, often caused by an inherited condition \ncalled congenital adrenal hyperplasia).  \n \n2. What you need to know before you give Alkindi \n \nDo not give Alkindi: \n- If your child is allergic to hydrocortisone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6). \n \n- If your child has difficulties swallowing food, or is a premature baby who cannot yet be fed by \n\nmouth. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your endocrinologist or pharmacist before giving Alkindi if your child is: \n\n Warning Alkindi granules come in a \n capsule that must be opened before use, \ndiscard the empty capsule after use out of reach \nof children. Do NOT swallow the capsule \u2013 small \nchildren may choke. \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n- unwell or has an infection. The endocrinologist may need to increase the dose of Alkindi \n\ntemporarily; talk to your endocrinologist if your child is unwell. If your child is vomiting or \nseriously unwell, your child may need an injection of hydrocortisone. Your endocrinologist will \ntrain you how to do this in an emergency. \n\n \n- due for a vaccination. Taking Alkindi should not stop your child being vaccinated. Let your \n\nendocrinologist know when your child is due for vaccinations. \n \n- due for an operation. Let the anaesthetist know your child is receiving Alkindi before your child \n\nhas their operation. \n \n- being fed through a nasogastric tube. Alkindi granules are not suitable for giving through a \n\nnasogastric tube as the granules may block the tube. \n \nYou should not stop giving Alkindi without the advice of your endocrinologist as this could make your \nchild seriously unwell very quickly. \n \nAs Alkindi is replacing the normal hormone your child lacks, side effects are uncommon, however: \n \n- Too much Alkindi can affect your child\u2019s growth, so your endocrinologist will adjust the dose \n\ndepending on your child\u2019s size and monitor your child\u2019s growth carefully. Let your \nendocrinologist know if you are worried about your child\u2019s growth (see section 4). \n \n\n- Too much Alkindi can affect your child\u2019s bones so your endocrinologist will adjust the dose \ndepending on your child\u2019s size. \n \n\n- Some adult patients taking hydrocortisone (similar to Alkindi) became anxious, depressed or \nconfused. It is not known if this would happen with children, but tell your endocrinologist if \nyour child develops any unusual behaviour after starting Alkindi (see section 4). \n \n\n- In some patients with allergies to other medicines, allergy to hydrocortisone has been seen. Tell \nyour endocrinologist straight away if your child has any reaction like swelling or shortness of \nbreath after being given Alkindi (see section 4). \n \n\n- Contact your endocrinologist if your child experiences blurred vision or other visual \ndisturbances. \n\n \nAlkindi granules can sometimes appear in a child\u2019s nappy or poo after taking Alkindi. This is because \nthe centre of the granule is not absorbed in the gut after it has released the medicine. This does not \nmean the medicine will not work and you do not need to give your child another dose. \n \nOther medicines and Alkindi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including those which can be obtained without a prescription. \n \nSome medicines can affect the way that Alkindi works, and may mean that your endocrinologist needs \nto alter your child\u2019s dose of Alkindi. \n \nMedicines that may mean your endocrinologist will increase your child\u2019s dose of Alkindi include: \n- Medicines used to treat epilepsy: phenytoin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine. \n- Medicines used to treat infections (antibiotics): rifampicin and rifabutin. \n- Medicines called barbiturates, which can be used to treat convulsions (including phenobarbital \n\nand primidone). \n- Medicines used to treat AIDS: efavirenz and nevirapine. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nMedicines that may mean your endocrinologist will decrease your child\u2019s dose of Alkindi include: \n- Medicines used to treat fungal diseases: itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. \n- Medicines used to treat infections (antibiotics): erythromycin and clarithromycin.  \n- Medicine used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS: ritonavir. \n \nAlkindi with food and drink \nSome food and drink may affect the way Alkindi works, and may mean that your endocrinologist \nneeds to decrease your child\u2019s dose. These include: \n- Grapefruit juice. \n- Liquorice. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nHydrocortisone can be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding when the body is not making enough \ncortisol. \n \nThere is no information on any effects of Alkindi on fertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAlkindi has no influence on a child\u2019s ability to perform skilled tasks (e.g. riding a bicycle) or using \nmachines. \n \n3. How to give Alkindi \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your endocrinologist, nurse or pharmacist has told you. Check \nwith your endocrinologist, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nYour endocrinologist will decide on the right dose of Alkindi based on your child\u2019s weight or size \n(body surface area) and then adjust the dose of Alkindi as your child grows. During illnesses, at times \nof surgical operations and during times of serious stress, your endocrinologist may recommend \nadditional doses of Alkindi and may also advise that your child receives other forms of hydrocortisone \ninstead of, or as well as, Alkindi. \n \nHow to give this medicine \nThe granules should be given into the mouth and should not be chewed. The capsule shell should not \nbe swallowed but should be carefully opened as follows: \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nIf you give more Alkindi than you should \nIf you give your child more Alkindi than you should, contact your endocrinologist or pharmacist for \nfurther advice as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to give Alkindi \nIf you forget to give your child a dose, give your child that dose as soon as you remember as well as \ntheir next dose at the usual time even if this means that your child receives two doses at the same time. \n \nIf you stop giving Alkindi \nDo not stop giving your child Alkindi without asking your endocrinologist first. Stopping the medicine \nsuddenly could quickly make your child very unwell. \n \nIf your child becomes unwell \nTell your endocrinologist or pharmacist if your child becomes ill, suffers severe stress, gets injured or \nis about to have surgery because your endocrinologist may need to increase the dose of Alkindi in \nthese circumstances (see section 2). \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n- If your child has any reaction like swelling or shortness of breath after being given Alkindi, get \n\nmedical help straight away and tell your endocrinologist as soon as possible as these can be \nsigns of an allergic reaction (see section 2). \n\n \nNo side effects have been observed with Alkindi, but the following side effects have been reported for \nother hydrocortisone medicines used to replace cortisol: \n \nFrequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n \n- Changes in behaviour including: \n\n- loss of contact with reality (psychosis) with sensations that are not real (hallucinations) \nand mental confusion (delirium). \n\n- overexcitement and overactivity (mania). \n- intense feeling of happiness and excitement (euphoria). \n\n \nIf your child has a dramatic change in behaviour, contact your endocrinologist (see section 2). \n\n \n- Stomach pains (gastritis) or feelings of sickness (nausea). \n \n\nContact your endocrinologist if your child complains of these. \n \n\n- Changes in blood potassium levels, leading to excessive alkalinity of body tissues or fluids \n(hypokalaemic alkalosis). \n\n \nYour endocrinologist will monitor your child\u2019s potassium levels to check for any changes. \n\n \nLong-term treatment with hydrocortisone may be associated with changes in the development of bones \nand reduced growth. Your endocrinologist will monitor your child\u2019s growth and bones (see section 2). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.

"do not give alkindi: - if your child is allergic to hydrocortisone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if your child has difficulties swallowing food, or is a premature baby who cannot yet be fed by mouth. warnings and precautions talk to your endocrinologist or pharmacist before giving alkindi if your child is: warning alkindi granules come in a capsule that must be opened before use, discard the empty capsule after use out of reach of children. do not swallow the capsule small children may choke. - unwell or has an infection. the endocrinologist may need to increase the dose of alkindi temporarily; talk to your endocrinologist if your child is unwell. if your child is vomiting or seriously unwell, your child may need an injection of hydrocortisone. your endocrinologist will train you how to do this in an emergency. - due for a vaccination. taking alkindi should not stop your child being vaccinated. let your endocrinologist know when your child is due for vaccinations. - due for an operation. let the anaesthetist know your child is receiving alkindi before your child has their operation. - being fed through a nasogastric tube. alkindi granules are not suitable for giving through a nasogastric tube as the granules may block the tube. you should not stop giving alkindi without the advice of your endocrinologist as this could make your child seriously unwell very quickly. as alkindi is replacing the normal hormone your child lacks, side effects are uncommon, however: - too much alkindi can affect your child's growth, so your endocrinologist will adjust the dose depending on your child's size and monitor your child's growth carefully. let your endocrinologist know if you are worried about your child's growth (see section 4). - too much alkindi can affect your child's bones so your endocrinologist will adjust the dose depending on your child's size. - some adult patients taking hydrocortisone (similar to alkindi) became anxious, depressed or confused. it is not known if this would happen with children, but tell your endocrinologist if your child develops any unusual behaviour after starting alkindi (see section 4). - in some patients with allergies to other medicines, allergy to hydrocortisone has been seen. tell your endocrinologist straight away if your child has any reaction like swelling or shortness of breath after being given alkindi (see section 4). - contact your endocrinologist if your child experiences blurred vision or other visual disturbances. alkindi granules can sometimes appear in a child's nappy or poo after taking alkindi. this is because the centre of the granule is not absorbed in the gut after it has released the medicine. this does not mean the medicine will not work and you do not need to give your child another dose. other medicines and alkindi tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines, including those which can be obtained without a prescription. some medicines can affect the way that alkindi works, and may mean that your endocrinologist needs to alter your child's dose of alkindi. medicines that may mean your endocrinologist will increase your child's dose of alkindi include: - medicines used to treat epilepsy: phenytoin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine. - medicines used to treat infections (antibiotics): rifampicin and rifabutin. - medicines called barbiturates, which can be used to treat convulsions (including phenobarbital and primidone). - medicines used to treat aids: efavirenz and nevirapine. medicines that may mean your endocrinologist will decrease your child's dose of alkindi include: - medicines used to treat fungal diseases: itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. - medicines used to treat infections (antibiotics): erythromycin and clarithromycin. - medicine used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection and aids: ritonavir. alkindi with food and drink some food and drink may affect the way alkindi works, and may mean that your endocrinologist needs to decrease your child's dose. these include: - grapefruit juice. - liquorice. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility hydrocortisone can be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding when the body is not making enough cortisol. there is no information on any effects of alkindi on fertility. driving and using machines alkindi has no influence on a child's ability to perform skilled tasks (e.g. riding a bicycle) or using machines.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

(see section 2). no side effects have been observed with alkindi, but the following side effects have been reported for other hydrocortisone medicines used to replace cortisol: frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): - changes in behaviour including: - loss of contact with reality (psychosis) with sensations that are not real (hallucinations) and mental confusion (delirium). - overexcitement and overactivity (mania). - intense feeling of happiness and excitement (euphoria). if your child has a dramatic change in behaviour, contact your endocrinologist (see section 2). - stomach pains (gastritis) or feelings of sickness (nausea). contact your endocrinologist if your child complains of these. - changes in blood potassium levels, leading to excessive alkalinity of body tissues or fluids (hypokalaemic alkalosis). your endocrinologist will monitor your child's potassium levels to check for any changes. long-term treatment with hydrocortisone may be associated with changes in the development of bones and reduced growth. your endocrinologist will monitor your child's growth and bones (see section 2). reporting of side effects if your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
