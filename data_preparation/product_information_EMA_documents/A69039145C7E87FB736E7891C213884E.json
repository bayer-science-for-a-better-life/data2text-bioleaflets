NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZenapax 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nDaclizumab*…………5 mg per 1 ml infusion \n \nOne vial of 5 ml contains 25 mg of daclizumab* (5 mg/ml). \n \n* Recombinant humanized IgG1 anti-Tac antibody produced in a murine NSO myeloma cell line using \na glutamine synthetase (GS) expression system (NS_GSO) by recombinant DNA technology \n \nExcipients: \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear to slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly yellowish liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZenapax is indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogenic renal \ntransplantation and is to be used concomitantly with an immunosuppressive regimen, including \ncyclosporine and corticosteroids in patients who are not highly immunised. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nZenapax should be prescribed only by physicians who are experienced in the use of \nimmunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation. \n \nThe recommended dose for Zenapax in adult and paediatric patients is 1 mg/kg. The volume of \nZenapax containing the appropriate dose is added to 50 ml of sterile 0.9% saline solution and is \nadministered intravenously over a 15 minute period. It may be given via a peripheral or central vein.  \n \nZenapax should initially be given within 24 hours before transplantation. The next and each \nsubsequent dose should be given at intervals of fourteen days, for a total of five doses.  \n \nElderly \n \nExperience with Zenapax in elderly patients (older than 65 years) is limited because of the small \nnumber of older patients who undergo renal transplantation, but there is no evidence that elderly \npatients require a different dosage from younger patients.  \n \nPatients with severe renal impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with severe renal impairment.  \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n\nNo data are available for patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nInstructions for the preparation of Zenapax infusions are described in section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nZenapax is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to daclizumab or to any excipients \nof this product (see section 6.1).  \n \nZenapax is contraindicated during lactation (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThere is no experience of the use of Zenapax in patients who are highly immunised.  \n \nAnaphylactic reactions following the administration of proteins can occur. Severe, acute (onset within \n24 hours) hypersensitivity reactions on both initial and subsequent exposure to Zenapax have been \nreported rarely. The clinical manifestations of these reactions include hypotension, tachycardia, \nhypoxia, dyspnoea, wheezing, laryngeal oedema, pulmonary oedema, flushing, diaphoresis, \ntemperature increase, rash and pruritus. Medications for the treatment of severe hypersensitivity \nreactions should therefore be available for immediate use. \n \nPatients on immunosuppressive therapy following transplantation are at increased risk for developing \nlymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) and opportunistic infections. While Zenapax is an \nimmunosuppressive drug, to date no increase in LPDs or opportunistic infections have been observed \nin patients treated with Zenapax. \n \nIn transplant recipients there is no experience of exposure to second or subsequent treatment courses \nusing Zenapax. \n \nIn a single randomized controlled clinical trial in cardiac transplant recipients which compared \nZenapax to placebo, each used in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept 1.5 g bid), \ncyclosporine, and corticosteroids, there were more infection related deaths among patients who \nreceived Zenapax. At 1 year post-transplant 14 of 216 patients (6.5%) who received Zenapax and 4 of \n207 (1.9%) patients who received placebo died of an infection, a difference of 4.6% (95% CI: 0.3%, \n8.8%). Of these 14 Zenapax patients, 4 died more than 90 days after receiving their last dose of \nZenapax, making it unlikely that Zenapax had a role in the infection related death. Overall, use of \npolyclonal antilymphocyte antibody therapy (OKT3, ATG, ATGAM) was similar in patients who \nreceived Zenapax and in patients who received placebo, 18.5% and 17.9%, respectively. However, of \nthe 40 patients who received both Zenapax and antilymphocyte therapy, 8 (20.0%) died whereas of the \n37 patients who received both placebo and antilymphocyte therapy, 2 (5.4%) died. Concomitant use of \nZenapax with another antilymphocyte antibody therapy in the context of intensive immunosuppression \nwith cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids may be a factor leading to fatal \ninfection. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBecause Zenapax is an immunoglobulin, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are to be expected.  \n \nThe following transplant medications have been administered in clinical trials with Zenapax without \nany interactions: cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, gancyclovir, acyclovir, tacrolimus, \nazathioprine, antithymocyte immune globulin, muromonab-CD3 (OKT3), and corticosteroids. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n\nThere are limited data from the use of daclizumab in pregnant women. A study in cynomolgus \nmonkeys has not shown teratogenic effects but did show an increase of early prenatal loss which \nremains in the historical spontaneous abortion rate (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance is \nunknown. \n \nZenapax should not be used in pregnant women unless it is clearly necessary. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive method during Zenapax therapy \nand continue its use for an additional 4 months following the last dose of Zenapax. \n \nLactation \nDaclizumab is excreted in cynomolgus monkey milk (see section 5.3). It is not known if Zenapax is \nexcreted in human milk. However due to potential harmful effects for the newborn, breast-feeding is \ncontraindicated during the treatment and up to 4 months following the last dose of Zenapax. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZenapax has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety profile of Zenapax was studied in comparison to placebo in patients who concomitantly \nreceived immunosuppressive regimens containing cyclosporine and corticosteroids alone, with the \naddition of azathioprine or with the addition of mycophenolate mofetil. The data from the four studies \n(O14392, O14393, O14874 and O15301) showed that the incidence and types of adverse events were \nsimilar in both placebo-treated and Zenapax-treated patients. Adverse events were reported by 95% of \nplacebo and 96% of daclizumab treated patients. Serious adverse events were reported by 44.4% of the \npatients in the placebo-treated group and 39.9% of the patients in the Zenapax-treated group.  \n \nAdverse events occurring with a frequency of ≥2% in patients in either group during the first 3 months \npost-transplant are listed below. \n \nWithin the system organ classes, undesirable effects are listed under headings of frequency, using the \nfollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).

A \ntotal of 16% (10 of 64 patients) of placebo-treated and 32% (28 of 88 patients) of Zenapax-treated \npatients had high fasting blood glucose values. Most of these high values occurred either on the first \nday post-transplant when patients received high doses of corticosteroids or in patients with diabetes. \n \nDeaths occurring during the first 6 months post-transplant were reported in 3.4% of the placebo- and \nin 0.6% of the Zenapax-treated groups. The twelve months mortality was 4.4% in the placebo- and \n1.5% in the Zenapax-treated groups. \n \nInfectious episodes, including viral infections, fungal infections, bacteraemia and septicaemia, and \npneumonia, were reported in 72% of the placebo-treated patients and in 68% of Zenapax-treated \npatients. The type of infections reported was similar in both the Zenapax- and the placebo-treated \ngroups. Cytomegalovirus infection was reported in 16% of the patients in the placebo group and in \n13% of the patients in the Zenapax group. \n \nIn rare cases severe hypersensitivity reactions following administration of Zenapax have been reported \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric patients: The safety profile for the use of Zenapax in paediatric patients was shown to be \ncomparable to that in adult patients. However, the following adverse events occurred more frequently \nin paediatric patients: diarrhoea (41%), postoperative pain (38%), fever (33%), vomiting (33%), \nhypertension (28%), pruritus (21%) and infections of the upper respiratory tract (20%) and urinary \ntract (18%).  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA maximum tolerated dose has not been determined in patients and could not be achieved in animals \nthat received Zenapax. A dose of 1.5 mg/kg has been administered to bone marrow transplant \nrecipients without any associated adverse events. In a single dose toxicity study a dose of 125 mg/kg \nwas administered intravenously to mice and showed no evidence of toxicity. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: selective immunosuppressive agents \nATC code: L04A A08 \n \nClinical Pharmacology \nZenapax contains daclizumab, a recombinant, humanized IgG1 anti-Tac antibody, and functions as an \ninterleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor antagonist. Daclizumab binds with high specificity to the alpha or Tac \nsubunit of the high affinity IL-2 receptor complex (expressed on activated T cells), and inhibits IL-2 \nbinding and biological activity. Administration of Zenapax inhibits IL-2-mediated activation of \nlymphocytes, a critical pathway in the cellular immune response involved in allograft rejection. \nDaclizumab saturates the Tac receptor for approximately 90 days at the recommended dosage regimen \nfor the majority of patients. Antibodies to daclizumab developed in approximately 9% of Zenapax-\ntreated patients in clinical studies but did not appear to affect efficacy, safety, serum daclizumab \nlevels, or any other clinically relevant parameter examined. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n7 \n\nNo gross changes to circulating lymphocyte numbers or cell phenotypes were observed by \nfluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis other than the expected transient decrease in Tac+ \ncells.  \n \nCombination Therapy in Renal Allograft Recipients \n \nIn Phase III trials Zenapax was added to a standard immunosuppressive regimen of cyclosporine \n(5 mg/kg) and steroids (prednisone or methylprednisolone), with or without addition of azathioprine \n(4 mg/kg). \n \nBoth trials showed a statistically significant superiority to placebo in reducing the rate of acute renal \nallograft rejection at six months post-transplant as confirmed by biopsy. From pooled data the \ndifference in biopsy-proven acute rejection remained statistically different at one-year posttransplant \n(43% as compared with 28%). Three year graft survival rates were significantly higher among those \npatients who did not experience acute rejection within the first year posttransplant (n=345) compared \nwith those who experienced acute rejection during the first year (n=190) regardless of treatment. The \nthree year graft survival was not significantly different between placebo and daclizumab in the triple \nimmunosuppressant trial (83% Vs. 84%) or the double immunosuppressant trial (78% Vs. 82%). The \nthree year patient survival rate was significantly different between placebo and daclizumab in the \ndouble immunosuppressant trial (88% Vs. 96%; p = 0.017), but not in the triple immunosuppressant \ntrial (94% Vs. 92%).  \n \nRenal function evaluated by serum creatinine and GFR was similar in both groups at three years \nposttransplant.  \n \nThe beneficial effect of Zenapax prophylaxis upon the incidence of acute rejection after renal \ntransplantation was not associated with adverse clinical sequelae, including the development of Post-\nTransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD), at 3 years posttransplant. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn clinical trials involving renal allograft patients-treated with 1 mg/kg of Zenapax every 14 days for a \ntotal of 5 doses, average peak serum concentrations (mean ± standard deviation) rose between the first \ndose (21 ± 14 µg/ml) and fifth doses (32 ± 22 µg/ml). The mean ± standard deviation trough serum \nconcentration prior to fifth dose was 7.6 ± 4.0 µg/ml. Serum levels of 0.5 to 0.9 µg/ml are needed to \nsaturate the IL-2 receptor and levels of 5-10 µg/ml are needed to inhibit IL-2 mediated biologic \nactivity. The recommended regimen of daclizumab will maintain serum concentrations sufficient to \nsaturate IL-2R alpha receptors on activated T lymphocytes for more than 90 days post transplantation \nin the majority of patients. This first three months, is the most critical period post-transplantation. \n \nThe estimate terminal elimination half-life of daclizumab ranged from 270 to 919 hours (average 480 \nhours) in renal allograft patients and is equivalent to that reported for human IgG which ranged from \n432 to 552 hours (average 480 hours). This is attributable to the humanisation of the protein.  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the systemic clearance of daclizumab was influenced \nby total body weight, age, gender, proteinuria, and race.  \n \nThe identified body weight influence on systemic clearance supports the dosing of Zenapax on a \nmg/kg basis and maintains drug exposure within 30% of the reference exposure for patient groups \nwith wide range of demographic characteristics. No dosage adjustments based on other identified \ncovariates (gender, proteinuria, race and age) are required for renal allograft patients.  \n \nPaediatric Patients: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties were evaluated in 61 paediatric \npatients treated with 1 mg/kg IV dose of Zenapax every 14 days for a total of 5 doses. Peak serum \nconcentrations (peak + SD) rose between the first dose (16 + 12 µg/ml) and the fifth dose (21 + \n14 µg/ml). The mean trough serum concentration before the fifth dose was 5.0 + 2.7 µg/ml. The Tac \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n8 \n\nsubunit of the IL-2 receptor was saturated immediately after the first dose of 1.0 mg/kg of daclizumab \nand remained saturated for at least the first three months post-transplant. Saturation of the Tac subunit \nof the IL-2 receptor was similar to that observed in adult patients receiving the same dose regimen. \n \nThere is no pharmacokinetic interaction between Zenapax and mycophenolic acid, the active \nmetabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDaclizumab was well tolerated after single bolus intravenous or subcutaneous doses ranging from \n50 to 125 mg/kg in mice, rats, and rabbits and after 28 days administration of 15 mg/kg to monkeys. \nOne of 18 monkeys had an anaphylactic reaction to daclizumab. Appreciable daclizumab serum levels \nwere maintained except in 2 out of 18 monkeys that developed anti-daclizumab antibodies. There was \nno cross reactivity in-vitro between daclizumab and human cryosections (28 organs) at concentrations \nup to 56 mg/ml, demonstrating the absence of non-specific binding. Daclizumab was not genotoxic in \nstandard tests. \n \nA non-clinical reproduction toxicity study with daclizumab has shown an increased risk of early \nprenatal loss in cynomolgus monkeys compared to placebo. However, the data show considerable \ninter-animal variation and were within the historical control range for this species. The overall prenatal \nlosses for the entire gestational period ranged from 20% to 45%. The incidence of stillbirth, caesarean \nsection and breech delivery were comparable between the control and treatment groups. \n \nIn the same non-clinical reproduction toxicity study with daclizumab, four out of seven lactating \ncynomolgus monkeys given a 5 – 10 fold multiple (10 mg/kg) of the normal human dose were found \nto secrete very low levels of daclizumab (0.17 – 0.28% of maternal serum levels) in breast milk. \n \n \n6.

WHAT ZENAPAX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nDaclizumab belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants. These medicines help to \nsuppress your body’s natural response to reject your transplanted organ. \n \nDaclizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody produced in a murine NSO myeloma cell line using \na glutamine synthetase (GS) expression system (NS_GSO) by recombinant DNA technology. \nMonoclonal antibodies are proteins which recognise and bind to other unique proteins in the body \ncalled antigens. Daclizumab binds to an antigen found on the surface of specific white blood cells \ncalled T lymphocytes. This activity suppresses the body’s natural immune response which otherwise \nmight cause transplant rejection. \n \nZenapax is used to prevent your body from rejecting transplanted kidneys. Zenapax is used together \nwith other immunosuppressive drugs, including cyclosporine and corticosteroids. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE ZENAPAX \n \nDo not use Zenapax  \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to daclizumab or to any of the other ingredients of Zenapax.  \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \nPlease read the section below on breast-feeding. \n \nTake special care with Zenapax \n- if you have ever had an allergic reaction to other immunosuppressive medicines, which help to \n\nsuppress the body’s natural defence mechanisms. \n \nTherapy with medicines which help to suppress the body’s natural defence mechanisms can increase \nthe risk for developing malignancies or infections. Zenapax does not increase this risk when it is used \ntogether with other immunosuppressive drugs, including cyclosporine and corticosteroids.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n21 \n\nSerious allergic reactions may occur following the administration of proteins. Allergic reactions \nfollowing the infusion of Zenapax have been reported rarely. In the event that you do develop an \nallergic reaction, your doctor will treat you with appropriate medication. \n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. This is extremely important because using more \nthan one medicine at the same time may strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines you are \ntaking. Therefore, Zenapax should not be used with other drugs without your doctor’s consent. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding. \n \nYou should not use this medicine if you are pregnant unless your doctor decides that it is necessary for \nyou. \n \nZenapax may cause damage to your unborn or breast-feeding baby. Tell your doctor straightaway if \nyou are pregnant, breast-feeding, become pregnant or plan to start a family in the near future. \n \nYour doctor should advise you about using contraception before treatment with Zenapax is started, \nduring treatment with Zenapax, and for an additional 4 months following the last dose of Zenapax. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThere is no evidence to indicate that Zenapax has an effect on your ability to drive a car or operate \nmachinery. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE ZENAPAX  \n \nZenapax  is NOT for direct injection. It should be diluted in 50 ml of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride \nsolution before administration to patients. \n \nA health care professional will give you a suitable dose (normally 1 mg/kg of body weight) in the \nform of an intravenous infusion over a 15- minute period. The first dose is given within 24 hours \nbefore your transplant. You will receive 4 subsequent doses which are spaced 14 days apart from each \nother. In total you should receive 5 doses of Zenapax for a complete treatment course. A course of \ntreatment usually lasts for 8 weeks. \n \nYou may receive subsequent infusions within a day before or after the scheduled administration. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Zenapax can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects occur: cough and \nshortness of breath, including when laying flat, vomiting, confusion or passing less urine then normal. \nThese side effects may occur when using Zenapax. These side effects can be serious and you may \nneed urgent medical attention. \n \nVery common side effects (occurring in 1 or more patients out of 10) are:  \n- difficulty sleeping \n- shaking (tremor) \n- headache \n- high blood pressure (hypertension) \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n22 \n\n- difficulty breathing \n- constipation; diarrhoea; vomiting; nausea; or heartburn \n- pain in joints and muscles \n- excess fluid in the body (oedema); swelling of the arms and legs (peripheral oedema) \n- problems with wound healing \n \nCommon side effects (occurring in between 1 and 10 patients out of 100) are inflammation of the \nthroat (pharyngitis); runny nose (rhinitis); diabetes mellitus; high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia); fluid \noverload; dehydration; anxiety; depression; dizziness; sensation of pins and needles; blurred vision; \nfast heart rate (tachycardia); bleeding (haemorrhage); blood clot (thrombosis); low blood pressure \n(hypotension); accumulation of lymph fluid in one part of the body (lymphocele); severe shortness of \nbreath, including when laying flat at night (pulmonary oedema); fluid on the lungs (pleural effusion); \ncollapsed lung (atelectasis); lack of oxygen in the body (hypoxia); congestion; cough; noisy or \nabnormal breath sounds, including crackling breath sounds (rales); bloated stomach; stomach pain or \ndiscomfort; flatulence; haemorrhoids; rash; itchy skin; acne; night sweats; increased sweating; \nexcessive hair growth (hirsutism); back pain; muscle cramps, particularly in the legs; pain in the joints \n(arthralgia); pain in the muscles (myalgia); chest pain; pain in general; tiredness; skin irritation at the \nsite of injection; fever; chills; general weakness; pain in the loins and changes or difficulty in passing \nurine (hydronephrosis); blood in the urine; pain on passing urine (dysuria); reduced urine output \n(oliguria); pain following surgery. \n \nRarely, allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) to Zenapax may occur. \n \nSome side effects are more likely to occur in children than in adults, these include diarrhoea, pain \nfollowing surgery, fever, vomiting, high blood pressure, itchy skin, infections of the nose and throat \nand infections in the urine. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \n \n5.
