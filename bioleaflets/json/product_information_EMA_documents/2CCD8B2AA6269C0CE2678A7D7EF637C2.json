Dose adjustment is not needed in adult patients with paediatric-\nonset hypophosphatasia (HPP) (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of asfotase alfa in elderly patients have not been established and no specific \ndose regimen can be recommended for these patients. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of asfotase alfa in patients with renal impairment have not been evaluated and \nno specific dose regimen can be recommended for these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of asfotase alfa in patients with hepatic impairment have not been evaluated \nand no specific dose regimen can be recommended for these patients. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nStrensiq is for subcutaneous use only. It is not intended for intravenous or intramuscular injection. \nThe maximum volume of medicinal product per injection should not exceed 1 ml. If more than 1 ml is \nrequired, multiple injections may be administered at the same time. \nStrensiq should be administered using sterile disposable syringes and injection needles. The syringes \nshould be of small enough volume that the prescribed dose can be withdrawn from the vial with \nreasonable accuracy. \n \nInjections sites should be rotated and carefully monitored for signs of potential reactions (see section \n4.4). \n \nPatients can self-inject only if they have properly been trained on administration procedures. \nFor handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSevere or life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients if \nhypersensitivity is not controllable (see section 4.4).   \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis have been \nreported in patients treated with asfotase alfa (see section 4.8). These symptoms included difficulty \nbreathing, choking sensation, periorbital edema, and dizziness. The reactions have occurred within \nminutes after subcutaneous administration of asfotase alfa and can occur in patients on treatment for \nmore than 1 year. Other hypersensitivity reactions included vomiting, nausea, fever, headache, \nflushing, irritability, chills, skin erythema, rash, pruritus, and oral hypoaesthesia. If these reactions \noccur, immediate discontinuation of treatment is recommended and appropriate medical treatment \nshould be initiated. The current medical standards for emergency treatment should be observed. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \nConsider the risks and benefits of re-administering asfotase alfa to individual patients following a \nsevere reaction, taking other factors into account that may contribute to the risk of a hypersensitivity \nreaction, such as concurrent infection and/ or use of antibiotics. If the decision is made to re-\nadminister the product, the re-challenge should be made under medical supervision and consideration \nmay be given to use of appropriate pre-medication. Patients should be monitored for recurrence of \nsigns and symptoms of a severe hypersensitivity reaction.    \n \nThe need for supervision for subsequent administrations and need for emergency treatment for home \ncare should be at the discretion of the treating physician. \n \nSevere or potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity is a contraindication to re-challenge, if \nhypersensitivity is not controllable (see section 4.3). \n \nInjection reaction \n \nAdministration of asfotase alfa may result in local injection site reactions (including, but not limited \nto, erythema, rash, discoloration, pruritus, pain, papule, nodule, atrophy) defined as any related \nadverse event occurring during the injection or until the end of the injection day (see section 4.8). \nRotation of injection sites may help to minimize these reactions.   \nStrensiq administration should be interrupted in any patient experiencing severe injection reactions \nand appropriate medical therapy administered. \n \nLipodystrophy  \n \nLocalized lipodystrophy, including lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy, has been reported at injection \nsites after several months in patients treated with asfotase alfa in clinical trials (see section 4.8). \nPatients are advised to follow proper injection technique and to rotate injection sites (see section 4.2). \n \nCraniosynostosis \n \nIn asfotase alfa clinical studies adverse events of craniosynostosis (associated with increased \nintracranial pressure), including worsening of pre-existing craniosynostosis and occurrence of Arnold-\nChiari malformation, have been reported in hypophosphatasia patients < 5 years of age. There are \ninsufficient data to establish a causal relationship between exposure to Strensiq and progression of \ncraniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis as a manifestation of hypophosphatasia is documented in published \nliterature and occurred in 61.3% of patients between birth and 5 years of age in a natural history study \nof untreated infantile-onset hypophosphatasia patients. Craniosynostosis can lead to increased \nintracranial pressure. Periodic monitoring (including fundoscopy for signs of papilloedema) and \nprompt intervention for increased intracranial pressure is recommended in hypophosphatasia patients \nbelow 5 years of age. \n \nEctopic calcification \n \nIn asfotase alfa clinical studies ophthalmic (conjunctival and corneal) calcification and \nnephrocalcinosis have been reported in patients with hypophosphatasia. There are insufficient data to \nestablish a causal relationship between exposure to asfotase alfa and ectopic calcification. Ophthalmic \n(conjunctival and corneal) calcification and nephrocalcinosis as manifestations of hypophosphatasia \nare documented in published literature. Nephrocalcinosis occurred in 51.6% of patients between birth \nand 5 years of age in a natural history study of untreated infantile-onset hypophosphatasia patients. \nOphthalmology examination and renal ultrasounds are recommended at baseline and periodically in \nhypophosphatasia patients. \n \nSerum Parathyroid Hormone and Calcium \n \nSerum parathyroid hormone concentration may increase in hypophosphatasia patients administered \nasfotase alfa, most notably during the first 12 weeks of treatment. It is recommended that serum \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nparathyroid hormone and calcium be monitored in patients treated with asfotase alfa. Supplements of \ncalcium and oral vitamin D may be required. See section 5.1. \n \nDisproportionate weight gain \n \nPatients may display disproportionate weight increase. Dietary supervision is recommended. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. the product is \nessentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with asfotase alfa. Based on its structure and \npharmacokinetics, asfotase alfa is unlikely to affect Cytochrome P-450 related metabolism. \n \nAsfotase alfa contains a catalytic domain of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase. Administration \nof asfotase alfa will interfere with routine measurement of serum alkaline phosphatase by hospital \nlaboratories resulting in serum alkaline phosphatase activity measurements of several thousand units \nper litre. Asfotase alfa activity results must not be interpreted as the same measure as serum alkaline \nphosphatase activity owing to differences in enzyme characteristics. \n \nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is used as the detection reagent in many routine laboratory assays. If \nasfotase alfa is present in clinical laboratory samples, aberrant values could be reported. \n \nThe treating physician should inform the testing lab that the patient is treated with medication \naffecting the ALP levels. Alternative assays (i.e. not utilizing an ALP-conjugated reporter system) \nmay be considered in patients treated with Strensiq. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are insufficient data from the use of asfotase alfa in pregnant women. \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous administration to pregnant mice in the therapeutic dose range \n(>0.5 mg/kg), asfotase alfa levels were quantifiable in fetuses at all doses tested, suggesting \ncross-placental transport of asfotase alfa. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). Asfotase alfa is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of \nchildbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of asfotase alfa in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from asfotase \nalfa therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy \nfor the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical fertility studies were conducted and showed no evidence of effect on fertility and \nembryo-fetal development (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nStrensiq has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nSupportive safety data reflect exposure in 112 patients with perinatal/infantile (n=89), juvenile-onset \n(n = 22), adult onset (n = 1) HPP (age at enrollment from 1 day to 66.5 years) treated with asfotase \nalfa, with a treatment duration range from 1 day to 391.9 weeks [7.5 years]). The most common \nadverse reactions observed were injection site reactions (74%). A few case reports of \nanaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reaction have been received \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions with asfotase alfa are listed by system organ class and preferred term using \nMedDRA frequency convention very common (â‰¥1/10), common (â‰¥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(â‰¥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (â‰¥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in clinical trials in hypophosphatasia patients \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency \ncategory \n\nAdverse reaction \n\nInfections and infestations Common Injection site cellulitis \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon Increased tendency to bruise \n\nImmune system disorders Common \n \n\nAnaphylactoid reactions  \nHypersensitivity2  \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon Hypocalcaemia \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache \nVascular disorders Common Hot flush \nGastrointestinal disorders Common Hypoaesthesia oral \n\nNausea \nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common Erythema \nCommon Skin discolouration  \n\nSkin disorder (stretched skin) \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Pain in extremity \n\nCommon Myalgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common Nephrolithiasis \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Injection site reactions1 \nPyrexia \nIrritability \n\nCommon Chills \nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nVery common Contusion \n\nCommon Scar \n1- Preferred terms considered as injection site reactions are presented in section below \n2- Preferred terms considered as hypersensitivity are presented in the section below \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nInjection site reactions (including injection site atrophy, abscess, erythema, discolouration, pain, \npruritus, macule, swelling, contusion, bruising, lipodystrophy (lipoatrophy or lipohypertrophy), \ninduration, reaction, nodule, rash, papule, haematoma, inflammation, urticarial, calcification, warmth, \nhaemorrhage, cellulitis, scar, mass, extravasation, exfoliation and vesicles) are the most common \nadverse reactions observed in about 74% of the patients in clinical studies. Most injection site \nreactions were mild and self-limiting, and the majority (> 99%) were reported as non-serious. In the \nclinical trial setting, the majority of patients who experienced an injection site reaction had the first \noccurrence within the first 12 weeks of treatment with asfotase alfa, and some patients continued to \nexperience injection site reactions until 1 or more years after initiating asfotase alfa dosing.  \nOne patient withdrew from the trial due to injection site hypersensitivity. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions include erythema/redness, pyrexia/fever, rash, pruritis, irritability, nausea, \nvomiting, pain, rigor/chills, hypoaesthesia oral, headache, flushing, tachycardia, cough, and signs and \nsymptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (see section 4.4). A few case reports of \nanaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reaction have also been received and were associated with signs and \nsymptoms of difficulty breathing, choking sensation, periorbital edema and dizziness. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nThere is potential for immunogenicity. Among 109 hypophosphatasia patients enrolled in the clinical \nstudies and who have post baseline antibody data available, 97/109 (89.0%) tested positive for anti-\ndrug antibodies at some time point after starting Strensiq treatment. Among those 97 patients, 55 \n(56.7%) also showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies at some time point post-baseline. The \nantibody response (with or without presence of neutralizing antibodies) was time variant in nature. In \nclinical trials, the development of antibodies has not been shown to affect clinical efficacy or safety \n(see section 5.2). Data from post-marketing cases suggests that the development of antibodies may \naffect clinical efficacy. \n \nNo trends in adverse events based on antibody status were observed in clinical trials. Some patients \nconfirmed positive for antidrug antibodies experienced injection site reactions (ISRs) and/or \nhypersensitivity, however there was no consistent trend in the frequency of these reactions over time \nnoted between ADA ever positive and ADA always negative patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience with overdose of asfotase alfa. The maximum dose of asfotase alfa used in \nclinical studies is 28 mg/kg/week. No dose-related toxicity or change in the safety profile has been \nobserved in clinical studies. Therefore, no overdose level has been determined. For management of \nadverse reactions, see sections 4.4 and 4.8. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes, ATC code: \nA16AB13 \n \nAsfotase alfa is a human recombinant tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase-Fc-deca-aspartate \nfusion protein that is expressed in an engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Asfotase alfa is a \nsoluble glycoprotein comprised of two identical polypeptide chains, each with a length of 726 amino \nacids made from (i) the catalytic domain of human tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, (ii) the \nhuman immunoglobulin G1 Fc domain and (iii) a deca-aspartate peptide domain. \n \nHypophosphatasia  \n \nHypophosphatasia is a rare, severe, and potentially fatal, genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function \nmutation(s) in the gene encoding tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase. Hypophosphatasia is \nassociated with multiple bone manifestations including rickets / osteomalacia, altered calcium and \nphosphate metabolism, impaired growth and mobility, respiratory compromise that may require \nventilation, and vitamin B6-responsive seizures. \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nAsfotase alfa, a human recombinant tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase-Fc-deca-aspartate fusion \nprotein with enzymatic activity, promotes mineralisation of the skeleton in patients with \nhypophosphatasia. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nStudy ENB-006-09/ENB-008-10 \n \nStudy ENB-006-09/ENB-008-10 was an open-label, randomised study. Thirteen patients were \nenrolled, 12 completed, and 1 discontinued (discontinuation early in the study due to a previously \nplanned elective scoliosis surgery).  At study completion patients had received a median of over \n76 months (6.3 years) of treatment (1 to 79 months). Five patients presented with symptoms of \nhypophosphatasia before 6 months age and 8 patients presented after 6 months age. Age at inclusion in \nthe study was between 6 and 12 years old and was between 10 and 18 years old at completion, with \n9 patients who became between 13 and 17 years old during the study. \nThe study employed historical controls from the same centres as patients who received asfotase alfa \nand who had been subject to a similar protocol of clinical management. \n \nThe effects of asfotase alfa on x-ray appearance \nTrained radiologists evaluated pre- and post-baseline x-rays of wrists and knees of patients for the \nfollowing signs: apparent physeal widening, metaphyseal flaring, irregularity of provisional zone of \ncalcification, metaphyseal radiolucencies, metadiaphyseal sclerosis, osteopenia, â€˜popcornâ€™ \ncalcification in metadiaphysis, demineralization of distal metaphysis, transverse subphyseal band of \nlucency and tongues of radiolucency. X-ray changes from baseline were then rated using the \nRadiographic Global Impression of Change rating scale as follows: -3=severe worsening, -2=moderate \nworsening, -1=minimal worsening, 0=no change, +1=minimal healing, +2=substantial healing, +3= \nnear-complete or complete healing. The majority of the patients who received asfotase alfa moved to \nscores of +2 and +3 over the first 6 months of exposure and this was sustained with on-going \ntreatment. Historical controls did not show change over time. \n \nBone biopsy \nTetracycline for bone-labelling was administered in two 3-day courses (separated by a 14-day interval) \nprior to acquisition of the bone biopsy. Trans-iliac crest bone biopsies were obtained by standard \nprocedure. Histological analysis of biopsies used Osteomeasure software (Osteometrics, USA). \nNomenclature, symbols and units followed recommendations of the American Society for Bone and \nMineral Research. For 10 patients in the per-protocol set (excludes those patients who received oral \nvitamin D between baseline and week 24) who underwent biopsy of the trans-iliac bone crest before \nand after receiving asfotase alfa: \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n- Mean (SD) osteoid thickness was 12.8 (3.5) Âµm at baseline and 9.5 (5.1) Âµm at week 24 \n- Mean (SD) osteoid volume / bone volume was 11.8 (5.9)% at baseline and 8.6 (7.2)% at week \n\n24 \n- Mean (SD) mineralisation lag-time was 93 (70) days at baseline and 119 (225) days at week 24 \n \nGrowth \nHeight, weight and head circumference were plotted on growth charts (series of percentile curves that \nillustrate distribution) available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. These \nreference data were drawn from a representative sample of healthy children and are not specific for \nchildren with special health care needs: they have been used in the absence of growth charts for \nchildren with hypophosphatasia. \nFor those patients who received asfotase alfa: 11/13 patients displayed persistent apparent catch-up \nheight-gain as shown by movement over time to a higher percentile on CDC growth charts. \n1/13 patients did not display apparent catch-up height-gain and 1 patient did not have enough data to \npermit judgement. Progress through Tanner stages appeared appropriate. \nFor the time period of observation of historical controls: 1/16 patients displayed apparent catch-up \nheight-gain, 12/16 patients did not display apparent catch-up height-gain and data were inconclusive in \n3/16 patients. \nSome patients required oral vitamin D supplements during the study (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy ENB-002-08/ENB-003-08  \n \nStudy ENB-002-08/ENB-003-08 was an open-label, non-randomised, non-controlled study. \n11 patients were enrolled in the initial study and 10 patients entered the extension study, with \n9 patients completing the extension study. At study completion, patients had received a median of over \n79 months (6.6 years) of treatment (1 to >84 months). Onset of hypophosphatasia was under 6 months \nin all patients. Age at treatment initiation in the study was between 0.5 to 35 months. \n7/11 patients in the full analysis set achieved Radiographic Global Impression of Change scores of +2 \nat Week 24 compared to baseline radiographs. The improvement in rickets severity was maintained for \nat least 72 months of follow-up treatment (including at least 84 months in 4 patients), as measured by \nthe RGI C. \n5/11 subjects displayed apparent catch-up height-gain. At last assessment (n = 10, 9 of whom had at \nleast 72 months of treatment), median Z-score improvements from baseline were 1.93 for \nlength/height and 2.43 for weight. Fluctuation in height-gain was apparent and may reflect the more \nsevere disease and higher rate of morbidity in these younger patients. \n \nStudy ENB-010-10 \n \nStudy ENB-010-10 was a controlled open-label study in 69 patients, aged 1 day to 72 months, with \nperinatal/infantile-onset HPP. The mean age at sign/symptom onset was 1.49 months. Patients \nreceived STRENSIQ at 6 mg/kg per week for the first 4 weeks. All patients began the study on a dose \nof asfotase alfa 6 mg/kg per week. The dose of asfotase alfa was increased for 11 patients during the \nstudy. Of these 11 patients, 9 patients had their doses increased specifically to improve clinical \nresponse. Thirty-eight patients were treated for at least 2 years (24 months) and 6 patients have been \ntreated for at least 5 years (60 months).  \nAt Week 48, 50/69 patients (72.5%) in the full analysis set achieved Radiographic Global Impression \nof Change scores â‰¥ 2, and were considered responders. Improvements in median RGI-C were \nmaintained over the course of treatment, which ranged from 0.9 to 302.3 weeks, even if fewer patients \nwere followed after Week 96 (a total of 29 patients were followed after Week 96 and â‰¤8 patients after \nWeek 192). \nHeight, weight and head circumference were plotted on growth charts (series of percentile curves that \nillustrate distribution) available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA. A \ntotal of 24/69 (35%) patients displayed apparent catch-up height-gain and 32/69 (46%) patients \ndisplayed apparent catch-up weight-gain, as shown by movement over time to a higher percentile on \nCDC growth charts. 40/69 patients and 32/69 patients did not show apparent catch-up gain in height \nand in weight, respectively. 4 patients did not have enough data to permit judgement and 1 patient \ncould not be determined with certainty. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \nStudy ENB-009-10 \n \nStudy ENB-009-10 was an open-label, randomised study. The patients were randomly assigned to \ntreatment group for the primary treatment period. Nineteen patients were enrolled, 14 completed, and \n5 discontinued.  At study completion patients had received a median of over 60 months of treatment \n(24 to 68 months). The onset of hypophosphatasia was under 6 months in 4 patients, between 6 \nmonths and 17 years in 14 patients, and over 18 years in one patient.  Age at inclusion was from 13 to \n66 years and was between 17 and 72 years at study completion. \n \nThe adolescent (and adult) patients in this study did not display apparent height-gain. \nPatients underwent biopsy of the trans-iliac bone crest either as part of a control group or before and \nafter exposure to asfotase alfa: \n- Control group, standard of care (5 evaluable patients): mean (SD) mineralisation lag-time was \n\n226 (248) days at baseline and 304 (211) days at week 24 \n- 0.3 mg/kg/day asfotase alfa group (4 evaluable patients): mean (SD) mineralisation lag-time \n\nwas 1236 (1468) days at baseline and 328 (200) days at week 48 \n- 0.5 mg/kg/day asfotase alfa group (5 evaluable patients): mean (SD) mineralisation lag-time \n\nwas 257 (146) days at baseline and 130 (142) days at week 48 \nAfter approximately 48 weeks all patients were adjusted to the recommended dose 1.0 mg/kg/day. \n \nVentilation support \nIn studies ENB-002-08/ENB-003-08 (11 patients) and ENB-010-10 (69 patients), both open-label, \nnon-randomised, non-controlled studies of patients aged 0.1 to 312 weeks at baseline. 69 patients \ncompleted the studies, and 11 discontinued. Patients received a median duration of treatment of \n27.6 month (range from 1 day to 90 months). 29 of 80 patients required ventilation support at baseline: \n\nâˆ™ 16 patients required invasive ventilation support (intubation or tracheostomy) at baseline \n(one had a brief period of non-invasive ventilation at baseline before transfer). \n\n- 7 patients were weaned off invasive ventilation (time on ventilation from 12 to \n168 weeks), 4 patients were off any ventilation support, and 3 patients were on non-\ninvasive ventilation support. Five out of 7 patients achieved an RGI-C score â‰¥2 \n- 5 patients continued with invasive ventilation support, 4 of them with RGI-C score \n<2 \n- 3 patients died whilst on ventilation support \n- 1 patient withdrew consent \n\nâˆ™ 13 patients required non-invasive ventilation support at baseline. \n- 10 patients were weaned off any ventilation support (time on ventilation from 3 to \n216 weeks). 9 out of 10 patients achieved a RGI-C score â‰¥2, only 1 with RGI-C <2.  \n- 2 patients required invasive ventilation support and 1 patient continued with non-\ninvasive ventilation support, all 3 patients died and with RGI-C score <2  \n\nThe natural history of untreated infant hypophosphatasia patients suggests high mortality if ventilation \nis required. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nStrensiq in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypophosphatasia (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under â€˜exceptional circumstancesâ€™. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetics of asfotase alfa were evaluated in a 1-month, multicenter, open-label, dose-\nescalating, study in adults with hypophosphatasia. Cohort 1 (n=3) of the study received asfotase alfa \n3 mg/kg intravenously the first week followed by 3 doses at 1 mg/kg subcutaneous at weekly intervals \nfrom weeks 2 to 4. Cohort 2 (n=3) received asfotase alfa 3 mg/kg intravenously the first week \nfollowed by 3 doses at 2 mg/kg subcutaneous at weekly intervals from weeks 2 to 4. After the 3 mg/kg \nfor 1.08 hours intravenous infusion, the median time (Tmax) ranged between 1.25 to 1.50 hours, and the \nmean (SD) Cmax ranged between 42694 (8443) and 46890 (6635) U/L over the studied cohorts. The \nabsolute bioavailability after the first and third subcutaneous administration ranged from 45.8 to \n98.4%, with median Tmax ranging between 24.2 to 48.1 hours. After the 1 mg/kg weekly subcutaneous \nadministration in Cohort 1 the mean (SD) AUC over the dosing interval (AUCÏ„) was 66034 (19241) \nand 40444 (N=1) U*h/L following the first and the third dose, respectively. After the 2 mg/kg weekly \nsubcutaneous administration in Cohort 2 the mean (SD) AUCÏ„ was 138595 (6958) and 136109 \n(41875) following the first and the third dose, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from all asfotase alfa clinical trials were analysed using population \npharmacokinetic methods. The pharmacokinetic variables characterized by population \npharmacokinetic analysis represent the overall hypophosphatasia patient population with age range \nfrom 1 day to 66 years, subcutaneous doses of up to 28 mg/kg/week and a range of disease onset \ncohorts. Twenty five percent (15 out of 60) of the overall patient population was adult (>18 years) at \nbaseline. The absolute bioavailability and absorption rate following subcutaneous administration were \nestimated to be 0.602 (95% CI: 0.567, 0.638) or 60.2% and 0.572 (95%CI: 0.338, 0.967)/day or \n57.2%, respectively. The central and peripheral volumes of distribution estimates for a patient with \nbody weight of 70 kg (and 95% CI) were 5.66 (2.76, 11.6) L and 44.8 (33.2, 60.5) L, respectively. The \ncentral and peripheral clearance estimates for a patient with body weight of 70 kg (and 95% CI) were \n15.8 (13.2, 18.9) L/day and 51.9 (44.0, 61.2) L/day, respectively. The extrinsic factors affecting \nasfotase alfa pharmacokinetic exposures were formulation specific activity and total sialic acid \ncontent. The average Â± SD elimination half-life following subcutaneous administration was 2.28 Â± \n0.58 days. \nIn adult patients with pediatric-onset HPP, the pharmacokinetics of asfotase alfa at doses of 0.5, 2 and \n3 mg/kg administered three times per week was consistent with those observed in pediatric patients \nwith pediatric-onset HPP, and thus supported the approved dose of 6 mg/kg per week in treating adult \npatients with pediatric-onset HPP. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nBased on the results of population pharmacokinetic analysis it was concluded that asfotase alfa \nexhibits linear pharmacokinetic up to subcutaneous doses of 28 mg/kg/week. The model identified \nbody weight to affect asfotase alfa clearance and volume of distribution parameters. It is expected that \npharmacokinetic exposures will increase with body weight. The impact of immunogenicity on asfotase \nalfa pharmacokinetic varied over time due to the time varying nature of immunogenicity and overall \nwas estimated to decrease pharmacokinetic exposures by less than 20%. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn nonclinical safety testing in rats, no body system-specific adverse effects were noted at any dose or \nroute of administration. \n \nDose - and time-dependent acute injection reactions that were transient and self-limiting were noted in \nrats at intravenous use doses of 1 to 180 mg/kg. \n \nEctopic calcifications and injection site reactions were observed in monkeys when asfotase alfa was \nadministered subcutaneously at daily doses up to 10 mg/kg through 26 weeks. These effects were \nrestricted to injection sites and were partially or completely reversible. \nThere was no evidence of ectopic calcification observed in any other tissues examined. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or toxicity to reproduction and development. However, in \npregnant rabbits administered intravenous doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day asfotase alfa, anti-drug \nantibodies were detected in up to 75% of animals which could affect the detection of reproductive \ntoxicity. \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of \nasfotase alfa. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you use Strensiq  \n3. How to use Strensiq  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Strensiq  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Strensiq is and what it is used for \n \nWhat is Strensiq \nStrensiq is a medicine used to treat the inherited disease hypophosphatasia that started in childhood. It \ncontains the active substance asfotase alfa. \n \nWhat is hypophosphatasia \nPatients with hypophosphatasia have low levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase that is \nimportant for various body functions, including the proper hardening of bones and teeth. Patients have \nproblems with bone growth and strength, which can lead to broken bones, bone pain, and difficulty \nwalking, as well as difficulties with breathing and a risk of seizures (fits). \n \nWhat is Strensiq used for \nThe active substance in Strensiq can replace the missing enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) in \nhypophosphatasia. It is used for long-term enzyme replacement treatment to manage symptoms. \n \nWhat benefits of Strensiq have been shown in clinical studies \nStrensiq has shown benefits for patientsâ€™ mineralization of the skeleton and growth. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Strensiq  \n \nDo not use Strensiq \nIf you are severely allergic to asfotase alfa (see section â€˜Warnings and precautionsâ€™ below) or any of \nthe other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before using Strensiq. \nâ€¢ Patients receiving asfotase alfa have had allergic reactions including life threatening allergic \n\nreactions requiring medical treatment similar to anaphylaxis. Patients who experienced \nanaphylaxis-like symptoms had difficulty breathing, choking sensation, nausea, swelling around \nthe eyes, and dizziness. The reactions occurred within minutes after taking asfotase alfa, and can \noccur in patients who were taking asfotase alfa for more than one year. If you experience any of \nthese symptoms, discontinue Strensiq and seek medical help immediately. \nShould you experience anaphylactic reaction, or an event with similar symptoms, your doctor \nwill discuss with you the next steps and the possibility to restart Strensiq under medical \nsupervision. Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor.    \n\nâ€¢ The development of blood proteins against Strensiq, also called anti-drug antibodies, may occur \nduring the treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience decreased efficacy with Strensiq. \n\nâ€¢ Fatty lumps or decreased fatty tissue on the surface of the skin (localized lipodystrophy) have \nbeen reported at injection sites after several months in patients using Strensiq. Read section 3 \ncarefully to know the injection recommendations. This is important to rotate the injection from \namong the following sites to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy: abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid. \n\nâ€¢ In studies, some eye-related side-effects (e.g. calcium build-up on the eye [conjunctival and \ncorneal calcification]) have been reported both in patients using Strensiq and those who were \nnot, probably associated with hypophosphatasia. Talk to your doctor in case of problems with \nyour vision. \n\nâ€¢ Early fusion of the bones of the head (craniosynostosis) in children below 5 years of age has \nbeen reported in clinical studies of infants with hypophosphatasia, with and without use of \nStrensiq. Talk to your doctor if you notice any change in the shape of your infantâ€™s head. \n\nâ€¢ If you are treated with Strensiq, you may experience a reaction at the injection site (pain, \nnodule, rash, discoloration) during the injection of the medicine or during the hours following \nthe injection. If you experience any severe reaction at the injection site, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\nâ€¢ Increase of parathyroid hormone concentration and low calcium levels have been reported in \nstudies. As a consequence, your doctor may ask you to take supplements of calcium and oral \nvitamin D if needed.  \n\nâ€¢ Weight gain may occur during your treatment with Strensiq. Your doctor will provide dietary \nadvice as necessary. \n\n \nOther medicines and Strensiq \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nIf you need to undergo laboratory tests (giving blood for testing), tell your doctor that you are treated \nwith Strensiq. Strensiq may cause some tests to show wrongly higher or lower results. Therefore, \nanother type of test may need to be used if you are treated with Strensiq.   \n \nPregnancy  \nStrensiq should not be used during pregnancy. The use of effective birth control during treatment \nshould be considered in women who are able to get pregnant.  \n \nBreast-feeding  \nIt is not known whether Strensiq can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding \nor plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to \nstop taking Strensiq, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Strensiq to \nthe mother. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine is not expected to have any effect on the ability to drive or use machines. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Strensiq \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, which means it is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use Strensiq \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse \nhas told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \nHow to use Strensiq will be explained to you by a doctor who is experienced in the management of \npatients with metabolic or bone related diseases. After being trained by the doctor or specialized nurse, \nyou can inject Strensiq yourself at home. \n \nDose \nâ€¢ The dose you receive is based on your body weight. \nâ€¢ The correct dose will be calculated by your doctor and consists of a total of 6 mg of asfotase \n\nalfa per kg of body weight every week, given either as an injection of 1 mg/kg asfotase alfa 6 \ntimes per week or as 2 mg/kg asfotase alfa 3 times per week depending on the recommendation \nof your doctor. Each dose will be administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneous), (see \nthe dosing chart below for detailed information on the volume to be injected, and the type of \nvials to be used, based on your weight).  \n\nâ€¢ Doses will need to be adjusted regularly by your doctor as the body weight changes. \nâ€¢ The maximum volume per injection should not exceed 1 ml. If more than 1 ml is required, you \n\nneed to do multiple injections immediately one after the other. \n \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nIf injecting 3 x per week \n \n\nBody \nWeight \n(kg) \n\nVolume \nto be \n\ninjected \n\nColor code \nof the vial \nto be used \n\n3 0.15 ml Dark blue  \n4 0.20 ml Dark blue  \n5 0.25 ml Dark blue  \n6 0.30 ml Dark blue  \n7 0.35 ml Orange \n8 0.40 ml Orange \n9 0.45 ml Orange \n10 0.50 ml Light blue \n11 0.55 ml Light blue \n12 0.60 ml Light blue \n13 0.65 ml Light blue \n14 0.70 ml Light blue \n15 0.75 ml Pink \n16 0.80 ml Pink \n17 0.85 ml Pink \n18 0.90 ml Pink \n19 0.95 ml Pink \n20 1 ml Pink \n25 0.50 ml Green \n30 0.60 ml Green \n35 0.70 ml Green \n40 0.80 ml Green \n\nIf injecting 6 x per week \n \n\nBody \nWeight \n(kg) \n\nVolume \nto be \n\ninjected \n\nColor code \nof the vial \nto be used \n\n6 0.15 ml Dark blue \n7 0.18 ml Dark blue  \n8 0.20 ml Dark blue  \n9 0.23 ml Dark blue  \n10 0.25 ml Dark blue  \n11 0.28 ml Dark blue  \n12 0.30 ml Dark blue  \n13 0.33 ml Orange \n14 0.35 ml Orange \n15 0.38 ml Orange \n16 0.40 ml Orange \n17 0.43 ml Orange \n18 0.45 ml Orange \n19 0.48 ml Light blue \n20 0.50 ml Light blue \n25 0.63 ml Light blue \n30 0.75 ml Pink \n35 0.88 ml Pink \n40 1 ml Pink \n50 0.50 ml Green \n60 0.60 ml Green \n70 0.70 ml Green \n80 0.80 ml Green \n90 0.90 ml Green (x2) \n\n100 1 ml Green (x2) \n \n \nInjection recommendations \nâ€¢ You may experience a reaction at the injection site. Read section 4 carefully to know what side \n\neffects can occur before using this medicine \nâ€¢ When injecting regularly, the injection site should be changed between different areas of the \n\nbody to help reduce potential pain and irritation \nâ€¢ Areas with a good amount of fat below the skin (thighs, arms (deltoids), abdomen, and buttocks) \n\nare the most suitable areas to inject. Please discuss with you doctor or nurse the best sites for \nyou.  \n\n \nBefore injecting Strensiq, please read the following instructions carefully \nâ€¢ Each vial is for single use and should only be punctured once. Only clear and colourless to \n\nslightly yellow aqueous solution without visible signs of deterioration should be used. Any \nunused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of immediately. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nâ€¢ If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be shown how to prepare and inject the \nmedicine by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not inject this medicine yourself unless you \nhave received training and you understand the procedure. \n\n \nHow to inject Strensiq \n \nStep 1: Preparing the Strensiq dose \n \n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n2. Take the unopened Strensiq vial(s) out of the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to \n\nallow the liquid to reach room temperature. Do not warm Strensiq in any other way (for \nexample, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). Upon Removal of the vial(s) from \nrefrigeration, Strensiq should be used within 3 hours maximum (see section 5. How to store \nStrensiq). \n\n3. Remove the protective cap from the Strensiq vial. Remove the protective plastic from the \nsyringe to be used.  \n\n4. Always use a new syringe contained in a protective plastic. \n5. Place a larger bore needle (e.g. 25G) on the empty syringe and with the protective cap on, \n\npush down and turn clockwise the needle onto the syringe until it is tight. \n6. Remove the plastic cap covering the syringe needle. Pay attention not to hurt yourself with the \n\nneedle.  \n7. Pull the plunger back to draw air into the syringe equal to your dose. \n\n \nStep 2: Withdrawing Strensiq solution from the vial \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1. Holding the syringe and vial, insert the \nneedle through the sterile rubber seal \nand into the vial. \n\n \n2. Push the plunger in completely to \n\ninject air into the vial. \n \n \n \n \n\n3. Invert the vial and syringe. With the \nneedle in the solution, pull the plunger \nto withdraw the correct dose into the \nsyringe. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n4. Before removing the needle from the \nvial, check the syringe for air bubbles. \nIn the event that bubbles appear in the \nsyringe, hold the syringe with the \nneedle pointing upwards and gently \ntap the side of the syringe until the \nbubbles rise to the top. \n \n\n5. Once all the bubbles are at the top of \nthe syringe, gently push on the plunger \nto force the bubbles out of the syringe \nand back into the vial. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n  \n6. After removing the bubbles, check the dose of medication in the syringe to be sure you have \n\ndrawn up the correct amount. You may need to use several vials to withdraw the complete \namount needed to reach the correct dose. \n\n \nStep 3: Placing the needle for injection on the syringe \n \n\n1. Remove the needle from the vial and place back the protective cap over the needle. \n2. Remove the larger bore needle pushing down and turning counterclockwise. Dispose the \n\nneedle with the protective cap in your sharps container. \n3. Place a smaller bore needle (e.g. 27 or 29G) on the filled syringe and with the protective cap \n\non, push down and turn clockwise the needle onto the syringe until it is tight. Pull the cap \nstraight off the needle. \n\n4. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up and tap the barrel of the syringe with your finger \nto remove any air bubbles. \n\nControl visually that the volume contained into the syringe is correct. \nThe volume per injection should not exceed 1 ml. If it is the case, multiple injections should be done at \ndifferent sites. \nYou are now ready to inject the correct dose. \n \nStep 4: Injecting Strensiq \n \n\n \n \n \n\n1. Choose an injection site (thighs, \nabdomen, arms (deltoids), buttocks). \nMost suitable areas for injection are \nmarked grey in the picture. Your doctor \nwill advise you on the possible injection \nsites \n\n \nNOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel \nlumps, firm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor \nabout anything you find. \n\n \n\n2. Gently pinch the skin of the chosen \ninjection area between your thumb and \nindex finger.\n\n \n \n\n \n\n3. Holding the syringe like a pencil or a \ndart, insert the needle into the raised skin \nso it is at an angle of between 45Âº and 90Âº \nto the skin surface.  \n\n \nFor patients who have little fat under the skin or \nthin skin, a 45Âº angle may be preferable.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4. While continuing to hold the skin, push \n\nthe syringe plunger to inject the medicine \nslowly, and steadily all the way in. \n\n \n5. Remove the needle, release the skin fold \n\nand gently place a piece of cotton wool \nor gauze over the injection site for a few \nseconds. \n\nThis will help seal the punctured tissue and \nprevent any leakage. Do not rub the injection site \nafter injection.  \n\nIf you need a second injection for your prescribed dose, get another Strensiq vial and repeat steps 1 \nthrough 4. \n \nStep 5: Disposing of supplies \n \nPlease collect your syringes, vials and needle in a sharps container. Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse \nwill advise you on how you can obtain a sharps container. \n\n \nIf you use more Strensiq than you should \nIf you suspect that you have been accidently administered a higher dose of Strensiq than prescribed, \nplease contact your doctor for advice. \n \nIf you forget to use Strensiq \nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose and contact your doctor for advice. \n \nFor more information, please consult: \n \n\n  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you are not sure what the side effects below are, ask your doctor to explain them to you. \n \nThe most serious side effects seen in patients receiving asfotase alfa have been allergic reactions \nincluding life threatening allergic reactions requiring medical treatment similar to anaphylaxis. This \nside effect is common [may affect up to 1 in 10 people]).

What you need to know before you use Strensiq  \n3. How to use Strensiq  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Strensiq  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Strensiq is and what it is used for \n \nWhat is Strensiq \nStrensiq is a medicine used to treat the inherited disease hypophosphatasia that started in childhood. It \ncontains the active substance asfotase alfa. \n \nWhat is hypophosphatasia \nPatients with hypophosphatasia have low levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase that is \nimportant for various body functions, including the proper hardening of bones and teeth. Patients have \nproblems with bone growth and strength, which can lead to broken bones, bone pain, and difficulty \nwalking, as well as difficulties with breathing and a risk of seizures (fits). \n \nWhat is Strensiq used for \nThe active substance in Strensiq can replace the missing enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) in \nhypophosphatasia. It is used for long-term enzyme replacement treatment to manage symptoms. \n \nWhat benefits of Strensiq have been shown in clinical studies \nStrensiq has shown benefits for patientsâ€™ mineralization of the skeleton and growth. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Strensiq  \n \nDo not use Strensiq \nIf you are severely allergic to asfotase alfa (see section â€˜Warnings and precautionsâ€™ below) or any of \nthe other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before using Strensiq. \nâ€¢ Patients receiving asfotase alfa have had allergic reactions including life threatening allergic \n\nreactions requiring medical treatment similar to anaphylaxis. Patients who experienced \nanaphylaxis-like symptoms had difficulty breathing, choking sensation, nausea, swelling around \nthe eyes, and dizziness. The reactions occurred within minutes after taking asfotase alfa, and can \noccur in patients who were taking asfotase alfa for more than one year. If you experience any of \nthese symptoms, discontinue Strensiq and seek medical help immediately.  \nShould you experience anaphylactic reaction, or an event with similar symptoms, your doctor \nwill discuss with you the next steps and the possibility to restart Strensiq under medical \nsupervision. Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor. \n\nâ€¢ The development of blood proteins against Strensiq, also called anti-drug antibodies, may occur \nduring the treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience decreased efficacy with Strensiq. \n\nâ€¢ Fatty lumps or decreased fatty tissue on the surface of the skin (localized lipodystrophy) have \nbeen reported at injection sites after several months in patients using Strensiq. Read section 3 \ncarefully to know the injection recommendations. This is important to rotate the injection from \namong the following sites to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy: abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid. \n\nâ€¢ In studies, some eye-related side-effects (e.g. calcium buildup on the eye [conjunctival and \ncorneal calcification]) have been reported both in patients using Strensiq and those who were \nnot, probably associated with hypophosphatasia. Talk to your doctor in case of problems with \nyour vision. \n\nâ€¢ Early fusion of the bones of the head (craniosynostosis) in children below 5 years of age has \nbeen reported in clinical studies of infants with hypophosphatasia, with and without use of \nStrensiq. Talk to your doctor if you notice any change in the shape of your infantâ€™s head. \n\nâ€¢ If you are treated with Strensiq, you may experience a reaction at the injection site (pain, \nnodule, rash, discoloration) during the injection of the medicine or during the hours following \nthe injection. If you experience any severe reaction at the injection site, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\nâ€¢ Increase of parathyroid hormone concentration and low calcium levels have been reported in \nstudies. As a consequence, your doctor may ask you to take supplements of calcium and oral \nvitamin D if needed.  \n\nâ€¢ Weight gain may occur during your treatment with Strensiq. Your doctor will provide dietary \nadvice as necessary. \n\n \nOther medicines and Strensiq \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nIf you need to undergo laboratory tests (giving blood for testing), tell your doctor that you are treated \nwith Strensiq. Strensiq may cause some tests to show wrongly higher or lower results. \nTherefore another type of test may need to be used if you are treated with Strensiq. \n \nPregnancy \nStrensiq should not be used during pregnancy. The use of effective birth control during treatment \nshould be considered in women who are able to get pregnant.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Strensiq can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding \nor plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to \nstop taking Strensiq, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Strensiq to \nthe mother. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine is not expected to have any effect on the ability to drive or use machines. \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Strensiq \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, which means it is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use Strensiq \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse \nhas told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \nHow to use Strensiq will be explained to you by a doctor who is experienced in the management of \npatients with metabolic or bone related diseases. After being trained by the doctor or specialized nurse, \nyou can inject Strensiq yourself at home. \n \nDose \nâ€¢ The dose you receive is based on your body weight. \nâ€¢ The correct dose will be calculated by your doctor and consists of a total of 6 mg of asfotase \n\nalfa per kg of body weight every week, given either as an injection of 1 mg/kg asfotase alfa 6 \ntimes per week or as 2 mg/kg asfotase alfa 3 times per week depending on the recommendation \nof your doctor. Each dose will be administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneous), (see \nthe dosing chart below for detailed information on the volume to be injected, and the type of \nvials to be used, based on your weight). \n\nâ€¢ Doses will need to be adjusted regularly by your doctor as the body weight changes. \nâ€¢ The maximum volume per injection should not exceed 1 ml. If more than 1 ml is required, you \n\nneed to do multiple injections immediately one after the other.  \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nIf injecting 3x per week \n \n\nBody \nWeight \n(kg) \n\nVolume \nto be \n\ninjected \n\nColor code \nof the vial \nto be used \n\n3 0.15 ml Dark blue \n4 0.20 ml Dark blue \n5 0.25 ml Dark blue \n6 0.30 ml Dark blue \n7 0.35 ml Orange \n8 0.40 ml Orange \n9 0.45 ml Orange \n10 0.50 ml Light blue \n11 0.55 ml Light blue \n12 0.60 ml Light blue \n13 0.65 ml Light blue \n14 0.70 ml Light blue \n15 0.75 ml Pink \n16 0.80 ml Pink \n17 0.85 ml Pink \n18 0.90 ml Pink \n19 0.95 ml Pink \n20 1 ml Pink \n25 0.50 ml Green \n30 0.60 ml Green \n35 0.70 ml Green \n40 0.80 ml Green \n\nIf injecting 6 x per week \n \n\nBody \nWeight \n(kg) \n\nVolume \nto be \n\ninjected \n\nColor code \nof the vial \nto be used \n\n6 0.15 ml Dark blue \n7 0.18 ml Dark blue \n8 0.20 ml Dark blue \n9 0.23 ml Dark blue \n10 0.25 ml Dark blue \n11 0.28 ml Dark blue \n12 0.30 ml Dark blue \n13 0.33 ml Orange \n14 0.35 ml Orange \n15 0.38 ml Orange \n16 0.40 ml Orange \n17 0.43 ml Orange \n18 0.45 ml Orange \n19 0.48 ml Light blue \n20 0.50 ml Light blue \n25 0.63 ml Light blue \n30 0.75 ml Pink \n35 0.88 ml Pink \n40 1 ml Pink \n50 0.50 ml Green \n60 0.60 ml Green \n70 0.70 ml Green \n80 0.80 ml Green  \n90 0.90 ml Green (x2) \n\n100 1 ml Green (x2) \n \n \nInjection recommendations \nâ€¢ You may experience a reaction at the injection site. Read section 4 carefully to know what side \n\neffects can occur before using this medicine \nâ€¢ When injecting regularly, the injection site should be changed between different areas of the \n\nbody to help reduce potential pain and irritation \nâ€¢ Areas with a good amount of fat below the skin (thighs, arms (deltoids), abdomen, and buttocks) \n\nare the most suitable areas to inject. Please discuss with you doctor or nurse the best sites for \nyou.  \n\n \nBefore injecting Strensiq, please read the following instructions carefully \nâ€¢ Each vial is for single use and should only be punctured once. Only clear and colourless to \n\nslightly yellow aqueous solution without visible signs of deterioration should be used. Any \nunused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of immediately. \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nâ€¢ If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be shown how to prepare and inject the \nmedicine by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not inject this medicine yourself unless you \nhave received training and you understand the procedure. \n\n \nHow to inject Strensiq: \n \nStep 1: Preparing the Strensiq dose \n \n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n2. Take the unopened Strensiq vial(s) out of the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to \n\nallow the liquid to reach room temperature. Do not warm Strensiq in any other way (for \nexample, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). Upon removal of the vial(s) from \nrefrigeration, Strensiq should be used within 3 hours maximum (see section 5. How to store \nStrensiq). \n\n3. Remove the protective cap from the Strensiq vial. Remove the protective plastic from the \nsyringe to be used.  \n\n4. Always use a new syringe contained in a protective plastic. \n5. Place a larger bore needle (e.g. 25G) on the empty syringe and with the protective cap on, \n\npush down and turn clockwise the needle onto the syringe until it is tight.  \n6. Remove the plastic cap covering the syringe needle. Pay attention not to hurt yourself with the \n\nneedle.  \n7. Pull the plunger back to draw air into the syringe equal to your dose. \n\n \nStep 2: Withdrawing Strensiq solution from the vial \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1. Holding the syringe and vial, insert the \nneedle through the sterile rubber seal \nand into the vial. \n\n \n2. Push the plunger in completely to \n\ninject air into the vial. \n \n \n \n \n\n3. Invert the vial and syringe. With the \nneedle in the solution, pull the plunger \nto withdraw the correct dose into the \nsyringe. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n4. Before removing the needle from the \nvial, check the syringe for air bubbles. \nIn the event that bubbles appear in the \nsyringe, hold the syringe with the \nneedle pointing upwards and gently \ntap the side of the syringe until the \nbubbles rise to the top. \n \n\n5. Once all the bubbles are at the top of \nthe syringe, gently push on the plunger \nto force the bubbles out of the syringe \nand back into the vial. \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n  \n6. After removing the bubbles, check the dose of medication in the syringe to be sure you have \n\ndrawn up the correct amount. You may need to use several vials to withdraw the complete \namount needed to reach the correct dose. \n\n \nStep 3: Placing the needle for injection on the syringe \n \n\n1. Remove the needle from the vial and place back the protective cap over the needle. \n2. Remove the larger bore needle pushing down and turning counterclockwise. Dispose the \n\nneedle with the protective cap in your sharps container. \n3. Place a smaller bore needle (e.g. 27 or 29G) on the filled syringe and with the protective cap \n\non, push down and turn clockwise the needle onto the syringe until it is tight. Pull the cap \nstraight off the needle. \n\n4. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up and tap the barrel of the syringe with your finger \nto remove any air bubbles. \n\nControl visually that the volume contained into the syringe is correct. \nThe volume per injection should not exceed 1 ml. If it is the case, multiple injections should be done at \ndifferent sites. \nYou are now ready to inject the correct dose. \n \nStep 4: Injecting Strensiq \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n1. Choose an injection site (thighs, \nabdomen, arms (deltoids), buttocks). \nMost suitable areas for injection are \nmarked grey in the picture. Your doctor \nwill advise you on the possible injection \nsites. \n\n \nNOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel \nlumps, firm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor \nabout anything you find. \n\n \n\n2. Gently pinch the skin of the chosen \ninjection area between your thumb and \nindex finger.\n\n \n \n\n \n\n3. Holding the syringe like a pencil or a \ndart, insert the needle into the raised skin \nso it is at an angle of between 45Âº and 90Âº \nto the skin surface.  \n\n \nFor patients who have little fat under the skin or \nthin skin, a 45Âº angle may be preferable.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n4. While continuing to hold the skin, push \nthe syringe plunger to inject the medicine \nslowly, and steadily all the way in. \n\n \n5. Remove the needle, release the skin fold \n\nand gently place a piece of cotton wool \nor gauze over the injection site for a few \nseconds. \n\nThis will help seal the punctured tissue and \nprevent any leakage. Do not rub the injection site \nafter injection.  \n\n \nIf you need a second injection for your prescribed dose, get another Strensiq vial and repeat steps 1 \nthrough 4. \n \nStep 5: Disposing of supplies \n \nPlease collect your syringes, vials and needle in a sharps container. Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse \nwill advise you on how you can obtain a sharps container. \n \nIf you use more Strensiq than you should \nIf you suspect that you have been accidently administered a higher dose of Strensiq than prescribed, \nplease contact your doctor for advice. \n \nIf you forget to use Strensiq \nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose and contact your doctor for advice. \n \nFor more information, please consult: \n \n\n \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you are not sure what the side effects below are, ask your doctor to explain them to you. \n \nThe most serious side effects seen in patients receiving asfotase alfa have been allergic reactions \nincluding life threatening allergic reactions requiring medical treatment similar to anaphylaxis. This \nside effect is common [may affect up to 1 in 10 people]). Patients who experienced these serious \nallergic reactions had difficulty breathing, choking sensation, nausea, swelling around the eyes, and \ndizziness.
