CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products \nin adult patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAdvagraf is a once-a-day oral formulation of tacrolimus. Advagraf therapy requires careful monitoring by \nadequately qualified and equipped personnel. This medicinal product should only be prescribed, and \nchanges in immunosuppressive therapy initiated, by physicians experienced in immunosuppressive \ntherapy and the management of transplant patients. \n \nDifferent oral formulations of tacrolimus should not be substituted without clinical supervision. \nInadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised switching between different oral formulations of tacrolimus \nwith different release characteristics is unsafe. This can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of \nadverse reactions, including under- or overimmunosuppression, due to clinically relevant differences in \nsystemic exposure to tacrolimus. Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with \nthe corresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should only take place \nunder the close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Following conversion to \nany alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring must be performed and dose adjustments made \nto ensure that systemic exposure to tacrolimus is maintained. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended initial doses presented below are intended to act solely as a guideline. Advagraf is \nroutinely administered in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents in the initial post-operative \nperiod. The dose may vary depending upon the immunosuppressive regimen chosen. Advagraf dosing \nshould primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each patient individually \naided by blood level monitoring (see below under “Therapeutic drug monitoring”). If clinical signs of \nrejection are apparent, alteration of the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered. \n \nIn de novo kidney and liver transplant patients AUC0-24 of tacrolimus for Advagraf on Day 1 was 30% \nand 50% lower respectively, when compared with that for the immediate release capsules (Prograf) at \nequivalent doses. By Day 4, systemic exposure as measured by trough levels is similar for both kidney \nand liver transplant patients with both formulations. Careful and frequent monitoring of tacrolimus trough \nlevels is recommended in the first two weeks post-transplant with Advagraf to ensure adequate drug \nexposure in the immediate post-transplant period. As tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, \nadjustments to the Advagraf dose regimen may take several days before steady state is achieved. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTo suppress graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, no limit to the \nduration of oral therapy can be given. \n \nProphylaxis of kidney transplant rejection \nAdvagraf therapy should commence at a dose of 0.20 - 0.30 mg/kg/day administered once daily in the \nmorning. Administration should commence within 24 hours after the completion of surgery. \nAdvagraf doses are usually reduced in the post-transplant period. It is possible in some cases to withdraw \nconcomitant immunosuppressive therapy, leading to Advagraf monotherapy. Post-transplant changes in \nthe condition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and may necessitate further dose \nadjustments. \n \nProphylaxis of liver transplant rejection \nAdvagraf therapy should commence at a dose of 0.10 - 0.20 mg/kg/day administered once daily in the \nmorning. Administration should commence approximately 12-18 hours after the completion of surgery. \nAdvagraf doses are usually reduced in the post-transplant period. It is possible in some cases to withdraw \nconcomitant immunosuppressive therapy, leading to Advagraf monotherapy. Post-transplant \nimprovement in the condition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and may \nnecessitate further dose adjustments. \n \nConversion of Prograf-treated patients to Advagraf \nAllograft transplant patients maintained on twice daily Prograf capsules dosing requiring conversion to \nonce daily Advagraf should be converted on a 1:1 (mg:mg) total daily dose basis. Advagraf should be \nadministered in the morning.  \n \nIn stable patients converted from Prograf capsules (twice daily) to Advagraf (once daily) on a 1:1 \n(mg:mg) total daily dose basis, the systemic exposure to tacrolimus (AUC0-24) for Advagraf was \napproximately 10% lower than that for Prograf. The relationship between tacrolimus trough levels (C24) \nand systemic exposure (AUC0-24) for Advagraf is similar to that of Prograf. When converting from \nPrograf capsules to Advagraf, trough levels should be measured prior to conversion and within two weeks \nafter conversion. Following conversion, tacrolimus trough levels should be monitored and if necessary \ndose adjustments made to maintain similar systemic exposure. Dose adjustments should be made to \nensure that similar systemic exposure is maintained. \n \nConversion from ciclosporin to tacrolimus \nCare should be taken when converting patients from ciclosporin-based to tacrolimus-based therapy (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). The combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus is not recommended. \nAdvagraf therapy should be initiated after considering ciclosporin blood concentrations and the clinical \ncondition of the patient. Dosing should be delayed in the presence of elevated ciclosporin blood levels. In \npractice, tacrolimus-based therapy has been initiated 12 - 24 hours after discontinuation of ciclosporin. \nMonitoring of ciclosporin blood levels should be continued following conversion as the clearance of \nciclosporin might be affected. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection \nIncreased doses of tacrolimus, supplemental corticosteroid therapy, and introduction of short courses of \nmono-/polyclonal antibodies have all been used to manage rejection episodes. If signs of toxicity such as \nsevere adverse reactions are noted (see section 4.8), the dose of Advagraf may need to be reduced. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after kidney or liver transplantation \nFor conversion from other immunosuppressants to once daily Advagraf, treatment should begin with the \ninitial oral dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation respectively for prophylaxis of \ntransplant rejection. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after heart transplantation \nIn adult patients converted to Advagraf, an initial oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day should be administered \nonce daily in the morning. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTreatment of allograft rejection after transplantation of other allografts \nAlthough there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung-, pancreas- or intestine-transplanted \npatients, Prograf has been used in lung-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of \n0.10 - 0.15 mg/kg/day, in pancreas-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day and in \nintestinal transplantation at an initial oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day.  \n \nTherapeutic drug monitoring \nDosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each individual \npatient aided by whole blood tacrolimus trough level monitoring. \n \nAs an aid to optimise dosing, several immunoassays are available for determining tacrolimus \nconcentrations in whole blood. Comparisons of concentrations from the published literature to individual \nvalues in clinical practice should be assessed with care and knowledge of the assay methods employed. In \ncurrent clinical practice, whole blood levels are monitored using immunoassay methods. The relationship \nbetween tacrolimus trough levels (C24) and systemic exposure (AUC 0-24) is similar between the two \nformulations Advagraf and Prograf. \n \nBlood trough levels of tacrolimus should be monitored during the post-transplantation period. Tacrolimus \nblood trough levels should be determined approximately 24 hours post-dosing of Advagraf, just prior to \nthe next dose. Frequent trough level monitoring in the initial two weeks post transplantation is \nrecommended, followed by periodic monitoring during maintenance therapy. Blood trough levels of \ntacrolimus should also be closely monitored following conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dose \nadjustments, changes in the immunosuppressive regimen, or co-administration of substances which may \nalter tacrolimus whole blood concentrations (see section 4.5). The frequency of blood level monitoring \nshould be based on clinical needs. As tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, following adjustments \nto the Advagraf dose regimen it may take several days before the targeted steady state is achieved. \n \nData from clinical studies suggest that the majority of patients can be successfully managed if tacrolimus \nblood trough levels are maintained below 20 ng/ml. It is necessary to consider the clinical condition of the \npatient when interpreting whole blood levels. In clinical practice, whole blood trough levels have \ngenerally been in the range 5 - 20 ng/ml in liver transplant recipients and 10 - 20 ng/ml in kidney and \nheart transplant patients in the early post-transplant period. During subsequent maintenance therapy, \nblood concentrations have generally been in the range of 5 - 15 ng/ml in liver, kidney and heart transplant \nrecipients. \n \nSpecial populations \nHepatic impairment  \nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment in order to maintain the \ntacrolimus blood trough levels within the recommended target range. \n \nRenal impairment  \nAs the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus are unaffected by renal function (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment \nis required. However, owing to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus careful monitoring of renal function \nis recommended (including serial serum creatinine concentrations, calculation of creatinine clearance and \nmonitoring of urine output). \n \nRace  \nIn comparison to Caucasians, black patients may require higher tacrolimus doses to achieve similar \ntrough levels. \n \nGender  \nThere is no evidence that male and female patients require different doses to achieve similar trough \nlevels. \n \nOlder peoples  \nThere is no evidence currently available to indicate that dosing should be adjusted in older people. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Advagraf in children under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nLimited data are available but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nAdvagraf is a once-a-day oral formulation of tacrolimus. It is recommended that the oral daily dose of \nAdvagraf be administered once daily in the morning. Advagraf prolonged-release hard capsules should be \ntaken immediately following removal from the blister. Patients should be advised not to swallow the \ndesiccant. The capsules should be swallowed whole with fluid (preferably water). Advagraf should \ngenerally be administered on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before or 2 to 3 hours after a meal, to \nachieve maximal absorption (see section 5.2). A forgotten morning dose should be taken as soon as \npossible on the same day. A double dose should not be taken on the next morning. \n \nIn patients unable to take oral medicinal products during the immediate post-transplant period, tacrolimus \ntherapy can be initiated intravenously (see Summary of Product Characteristics for Prograf 5 mg/ml \nconcentrate for solution for infusion) at a dose approximately 1/5th of the recommended oral dose for the \ncorresponding indication. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to tacrolimus, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \nHypersensitivity to other macrolides \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMedication errors, including inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised substitution of immediate- or \nprolonged-release tacrolimus formulations, have been observed. This has led to serious adverse reactions, \nincluding graft rejection, or other adverse reactions which could be a consequence of either under- or \nover-exposure to tacrolimus. Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the \ncorresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should only take place under \nthe close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nAdvagraf is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to limited data on safety and/or \nefficacy. \n \nFor treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal \nproducts in adult patients clinical data are not yet available for the prolonged-release formulation \nAdvagraf. \n \nFor prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart allograft recipients clinical data are not yet available \nfor Advagraf. \n \nDuring the initial post-transplant period, monitoring of the following parameters should be undertaken on \na routine basis: blood pressure, ECG, neurological and visual status, fasting blood glucose levels, \nelectrolytes (particularly potassium), liver and renal function tests, haematology parameters, coagulation \nvalues, and plasma protein determinations. If clinically relevant changes are seen, adjustments of the \nimmunosuppressive regimen should be considered. \n \nWhen substances with a potential for interaction (see section 4.5) - particularly strong inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (such as telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, \ntelithromycin or clarithromycin) or inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin) – are being \ncombined with tacrolimus, tacrolimus blood levels should be monitored to adjust the tacrolimus dose as \nappropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus exposure. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nHerbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal preparations \nshould be avoided when taking Advagraf due to the risk of interactions that lead to either a decrease in \nblood concentrations of tacrolimus and reduced clinical effect of tacrolimus, or an increase in blood \nconcentrations of tacrolimus and risk of tacrolimus toxicity (see section 4.5). \n \nThe combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be avoided and care should be taken \nwhen administering tacrolimus to patients who have previously received ciclosporin (see sections 4.2 and \n4.5). \n \nHigh potassium intake or potassium-sparing diuretics should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nCertain combinations of tacrolimus with drugs known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effects may \nincrease the risk of these effects (see section 4.5). \n \nImmunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment with \ntacrolimus may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. As gastrointestinal \nperforation is a medically important event that may lead to a life-threatening or serious condition, \nadequate treatments should be considered immediately after suspected symptoms or signs occur. \n \nSince levels of tacrolimus in blood may significantly change during diarrhoea episodes, extra monitoring \nof tacrolimus concentrations is recommended during episodes of diarrhoea. \n \nCardiac disorders \nVentricular hypertrophy or hypertrophy of the septum, reported as cardiomyopathies, have been observed \nin Prograf treated patients on rare occasions and may also occur with Advagraf. Most cases have been \nreversible, occurring with tacrolimus blood trough concentrations much higher than the recommended \nmaximum levels. Other factors observed to increase the risk of these clinical conditions included pre-\nexisting heart disease, corticosteroid usage, hypertension, renal or hepatic dysfunction, infections, fluid \noverload, and oedema. Accordingly, high-risk patients receiving substantial immunosuppression should \nbe monitored, using such procedures as echocardiography or ECG pre- and post-transplant (e.g. initially \nat 3 months and then at 9 -12 months). If abnormalities develop, dose reduction of Advagraf, or change of \ntreatment to another immunosuppressive agent should be considered. Tacrolimus may prolong the QT \ninterval and may cause Torsades de Pointes. Caution should be exercised in patients with risk factors for \nQT prolongation, including patients with a personal or family history of QT prolongation, congestive \nheart failure, bradyarrhythmias and electrolyte abnormalities. Caution should also be exercised in patients \ndiagnosed or suspected to have Congenital Long QT Syndrome or acquired QT prolongation or patients \non concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval, induce electrolyte abnormalities or known \nto increase tacrolimus exposure (see section 4.5).   \n \nLymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies \nPatients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV)-associated \nlymphoproliferative disorders (see section 4.8). A combination of immunosuppressives such as \nantilymphocytic antibodies (e.g. basiliximab, daclizumab) given concomitantly increases the risk of EBV-\nassociated lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV-Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA)-negative patients have been \nreported to have an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders. Therefore, in this patient \ngroup, EBV-VCA serology should be ascertained before starting treatment with Advagraf. During \ntreatment, careful monitoring with EBV-PCR is recommended. Positive EBV-PCR may persist for \nmonths and is per se not indicative of lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma. \n \n\nAs with other potent immunosuppressive compounds, the risk of secondary cancer is unknown (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAs with other immunosuppressive agents, owing to the potential risk of malignant skin changes, exposure \nto sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a \nhigh protection factor. \n \n\nInfections including opportunistic infections  \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including Advagraf are at increased risk for infections \nincluding opportunistic infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal) such as BK virus associated \nnephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients are \nalso at an increased risk of infections with viral hepatitis (for example, hepatitis B and C reactivation and \nde novo infection, as well as hepatitis E, which may become chronic). These infections are often related \nto a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians \nshould consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating hepatic or \nrenal function or neurological symptoms. Prevention and management should be in accordance with \nappropriate clinical guidance. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \nPatients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop posterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome (PRES). If patients taking tacrolimus present with symptoms indicating PRES such as \nheadache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances, a radiological procedure (e.g. MRI) \nshould be performed. If PRES is diagnosed, adequate blood pressure and seizure control and immediate \ndiscontinuation of systemic tacrolimus is advised. Most patients completely recover after appropriate \nmeasures are taken. \n \nEye disorders \nEye disorders, sometimes progressing to loss of vision, have been reported in patients treated with \ntacrolimus. Some cases have reported resolution on switching to alternative immunosuppression. Patients \nshould be advised to report changes in visual acuity, changes in colour vision, blurred vision, or visual \nfield defect, and in such cases, prompt evaluation is recommended with referral to an ophthalmologist as \nappropriate. \n \nPure Red Cell Aplasia \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. All patients \nreported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, underlying disease or concomitant \nmedications associated with PRCA. \n \nSpecial populations \nThere is limited experience in non-Caucasian patients and patients at elevated immunological risk (e.g. \nretransplantation, evidence of panel reactive antibodies, PRA). \n \nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \nAdvagraf capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThe printing ink used to mark Advagraf capsules contains soya lecithin. In patients who are \nhypersensitive to peanut or soya, the risk and severity of hypersensitivity should be weighed against the \nbenefit of using Advagraf. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSystemically available tacrolimus is metabolised by hepatic CYP3A4. There is also evidence of \ngastrointestinal metabolism by CYP3A4 in the intestinal wall. Concomitant use of substances known to \ninhibit or induce CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby increase or decrease \ntacrolimus blood levels. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIt is strongly recommended to closely monitor tacrolimus blood levels, as well as, QT prolongation (with \nECG), renal function and other side effects, whenever substances which have the potential to alter \nCYP3A4 metabolism or otherwise influence tacrolimus blood levels are used concomitantly, and to \ninterrupt or adjust the tacrolimus dose as appropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus exposure (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels \nClinically the following substances have been shown to increase tacrolimus blood levels: \nStrong interactions have been observed with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and isavuconazole, the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, HIV protease \ninhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. telaprevir, boceprevir, and \nthe combination of ombitasvir and paritaprevir with ritonavir, when used with and without dasabuvir), or \nthe CMV antiviral letermovir, the pharmacokinetic enhancer cobicistat, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors \nnilotinib and imatinib. Concomitant use of these substances may require decreased tacrolimus doses in \nnearly all patients. Pharmacokinetics studies have indicated that the increase in blood levels is mainly a \nresult of increase in oral bioavailability of tacrolimus owing to the inhibition of gastrointestinal \nmetabolism. Effect on hepatic clearance is less pronounced. \nWeaker interactions have been observed with clotrimazole, clarithromycin, josamycin, nifedipine, \nnicardipine, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone, danazol, ethinylestradiol, omeprazole, nefazodone and \n(Chinese) herbal remedies containing extracts of Schisandra sphenanthera. \nIn vitro the following substances have been shown to be potential inhibitors of tacrolimus metabolism: \nbromocriptine, cortisone, dapsone, ergotamine, gestodene, lidocaine, mephenytoin, miconazole, \nmidazolam, nilvadipine, norethindrone, quinidine, tamoxifen, (triacetyl)oleandomycin. \nGrapefruit juice has been reported to increase the blood level of tacrolimus and should therefore be avoided. \nLansoprazole and ciclosporin may potentially inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of tacrolimus and \nthereby increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. \n \nOther interactions potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels \nTacrolimus is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Possible interactions with other active substances \nknown to have high affinity for plasma proteins should be considered (e.g., NSAIDs, oral anticoagulants, \nor oral antidiabetics). \nOther potential interactions that may increase systemic exposure of tacrolimus include prokinetic agents \n(such as metoclopramide and cisapride), cimetidine and magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers potentially leading to decreased tacrolimus blood levels \nClinically the following substances have been shown to decrease tacrolimus blood levels: \nStrong interactions have been observed with rifampicin, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort (Hypericum \nperforatum) which may require increased tacrolimus doses in almost all patients. Clinically significant \ninteractions have also been observed with phenobarbital. Maintenance doses of corticosteroids have been \nshown to reduce tacrolimus blood levels. \n \nHigh dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone administered for the treatment of acute rejection have the \npotential to increase or decrease tacrolimus blood levels. \nCarbamazepine, metamizole and isoniazid have the potential to decrease tacrolimus concentrations. \n \nEffect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicinal products \nTacrolimus is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor; thus concomitant use of tacrolimus with medicinal products \nknown to be metabolised by CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of such medicinal products. \nThe half-life of ciclosporin is prolonged when tacrolimus is given concomitantly. In addition, \nsynergistic/additive nephrotoxic effects can occur. For these reasons, the combined administration of \nciclosporin and tacrolimus is not recommended and care should be taken when administering tacrolimus \nto patients who have previously received ciclosporin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nTacrolimus has been shown to increase the blood level of phenytoin. \nAs tacrolimus may reduce the clearance of steroid-based contraceptives leading to increased hormone \nexposure, particular care should be exercised when deciding upon contraceptive measures. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nLimited knowledge of interactions between tacrolimus and statins is available. Clinical data suggest that \nthe pharmacokinetics of statins are largely unaltered by the co-administration of tacrolimus. \nAnimal data have shown that tacrolimus could potentially decrease the clearance and increase the half-life \nof pentobarbital and antipyrine. \n \nMycophenolic acid. Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from ciclosporin, \nwhich interferes with enterohepatic recirculation of mycophenolic acid, to tacrolimus, which is devoid of \nthis effect, as this might result in changes of mycophenolic acid exposure. Drugs which interfere with \nmycophenolic acid's enterohepatic cycle have potential to reduce the plasma level and efficacy of \nmycophenolic acid. Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid may be appropriate when \nswitching from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa. \n\n \nOther interactions leading to clinically detrimental effects \nConcurrent use of tacrolimus with medicinal products known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effects \nmay increase these effects (e.g., aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors, vancomycin, cotrimoxazole, \nNSAIDs, ganciclovir or aciclovir). \nEnhanced nephrotoxicity has been observed following the administration of amphotericin B and \nibuprofen in conjunction with tacrolimus. \n \nAs tacrolimus treatment may be associated with hyperkalaemia, or may increase pre-existing \nhyperkalaemia, high potassium intake, or potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or \nspironolactone) should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment with \ntacrolimus may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nHuman data show that tacrolimus crosses the placenta. Limited data from organ transplant recipients \nshow no evidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions on the course and outcome of pregnancy under \ntacrolimus treatment compared with other immunosuppressive medicinal products. However, cases of \nspontaneous abortion have been reported. To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are available. \nTacrolimus treatment can be considered in pregnant women, when there is no safer alternative and when \nthe perceived benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. In case of in utero exposure, monitoring of \nthe newborn for the potential adverse events of tacrolimus is recommended (in particular effects on the \nkidneys). There is a risk for premature delivery (<37 week) (incidence of 66 of 123 births, i.e. 53.7%; \nhowever, data showed that the majority of the newborns had normal birth weight for their gestational age) \nas well as for hyperkalaemia in the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 neonates, i.e. 7.2 %) which, however \nnormalises spontaneously. \nIn rats and rabbits, tacrolimus caused embryofoetal toxicity at doses which demonstrated maternal \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nHuman data demonstrate that tacrolimus is excreted in breast milk. As detrimental effects on the newborn \ncannot be excluded, women should not breast-feed whilst receiving Advagraf. \n \nFertility \nA negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reduced sperm counts and motility was \nobserved in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTacrolimus may cause visual and neurological disturbances. This effect may be enhanced if tacrolimus is \nadministered in association with alcohol. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nNo studies on the effects of tacrolimus (Advagraf) on the ability to drive and use machines have been \nperformed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe adverse reaction profile associated with immunosuppressive agents is often difficult to establish \nowing to the underlying disease and the concurrent use of multiple medicinal products. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in > 10% of patients) are tremor, renal \nimpairment, hyperglycaemic conditions, diabetes mellitus, hyperkalaemia, infections, hypertension and \ninsomnia. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInfections and infestations \nAs is well known for other potent immunosuppressive agents, patients receiving tacrolimus are frequently \nat increased risk for infections (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal). The course of pre-existing infections \nmay be aggravated. Both generalised and localised infections can occur. \nCases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including \nAdvagraf. \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk of developing malignancies. Benign \nas well as malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin \nmalignancies have been reported in association with tacrolimus treatment. \n \nBlood and

QT prolonged \n \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \ncommon:  primary graft dysfunction \nMedication errors, including inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised substitution of immediate- or \nprolonged-release tacrolimus formulations, have been observed. A number of associated cases of \ntransplant rejection have been reported (frequency cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPain in extremity has been described in a number of published case reports as part of Calcineurin-\nInhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS). This typically presents as a bilateral and symmetrical, severe, \nascending pain in the lower extremities and may be associated with supra-therapeutic levels of tacrolimus. \nThe syndrome may respond to tacrolimus dose reduction. In some cases, it was necessary to switch to \nalternative immunosuppression. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with overdose is limited. Several cases of accidental overdose have been reported with \ntacrolimus; symptoms have included tremor, headache, nausea and vomiting, infections, urticaria, \nlethargy and increases in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase levels. \nNo specific antidote to tacrolimus therapy is available. If overdose occurs, general supportive measures \nand symptomatic treatment should be conducted. \nBased on its high molecular weight, poor aqueous solubility, and extensive erythrocyte and plasma \nprotein binding, it is anticipated that tacrolimus will not be dialysable. In isolated patients with very high \nplasma levels, haemofiltration or -diafiltration have been effective in reducing toxic concentrations. In \ncases of oral intoxication, gastric lavage and/or the use of adsorbents (such as activated charcoal) may be \nhelpful, if used shortly after intake. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, calcineurin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AD02 \n \nMechanism of action \nAt the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus appear to be mediated by binding to a cytosolic protein \n(FKBP12) which is responsible for the intracellular accumulation of the compound. The FKBP12-\ntacrolimus complex specifically and competitively binds to and inhibits calcineurin, leading to a calcium-\ndependent inhibition of T-cell signal transduction pathways, thereby preventing transcription of a discrete \nset of cytokine genes. \nTacrolimus is a highly potent immunosuppressive agent and has proven activity in both in vitro and in \nvivo experiments. \nIn particular, tacrolimus inhibits the formation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, which are mainly responsible \nfor graft rejection. Tacrolimus suppresses T-cell activation and T-helper-cell dependent B-cell \nproliferation, as well as the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukins-2, -3, and γ-interferon) and \nthe expression of the interleukin-2 receptor. \n \nResults from clinical trials performed with once-daily tacrolimus Advagraf \nLiver transplantation \nThe efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf, both in combination with corticosteroids, was compared \nin 471 de novo liver transplant recipients. The event rate of biopsy confirmed acute rejection within the \nfirst 24 weeks after transplantation was 32.6% in the Advagraf group (N=237) and 29.3% in the Prograf \ngroup (N=234). The treatment difference (Advagraf – Prograf) was 3.3% (95% confidence interval [-\n5.7%, 12.3%]).The 12-month patient survival rates were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90.8% for Prograf; in \nthe Advagraf arm 25 patients died (14 female, 11 male) and in the Prograf arm 24 patients died (5 female, \n19 male). 12-month graft survival was 85.3% for Advagraf and 85.6% for Prograf. \n \nKidney transplantation \nThe efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf, both in combination with mycophenolate mofetil \n(MMF) and corticosteroids, was compared in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients. The event rate for \nbiopsy-confirmed acute rejection within the first 24 weeks after transplantation was 18.6% in the \nAdvagraf group (N=331) and 14.9% in the Prograf group (N=336). The treatment difference (Advagraf-\nPrograf) was 3.8% (95% confidence interval [-2.1%, 9.6%]). The 12-month patient survival rates were \n96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and \n\n\n\n15 \n\nin the Prograf arm 8 patients died (3 female, 5 male). 12-month graft survival was 91.5% for Advagraf \nand 92.8% for Prograf. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Prograf, ciclosporin and Advagraf, all in combination with basiliximab \nantibody induction, MMF and corticosteroids, was compared in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients. \nThe incidence of efficacy failure at 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy-confirmed acute \nrejection, or lost to follow-up) was 14.0% in the Advagraf group (N=214), 15.1% in the Prograf group \n(N=212) and 17.0% in the ciclosporin group (N=212). The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf-\nciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs. ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-\nciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs. ciclosporin. The 12-month patient \nsurvival rates were 98.6% for Advagraf, 95.7% for Prograf and 97.6% for ciclosporin; in the Advagraf \narm 3 patients died (all male), in the Prograf arm 10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and in the \nciclosporin arm 6 patients died (3 female, 3 male). 12-month graft survival was 96.7% for Advagraf, \n92.9% for Prograf and 95.7% for ciclosporin. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety of Prograf capsules bid in primary organ transplantation \nIn prospective studies oral Prograf was investigated as primary immunosuppressant in approximately 175 \npatients following lung, 475 patients following pancreas and 630 patients following intestinal \ntransplantation. Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies appeared to be similar \nto what was reported in the large studies, where Prograf was used as primary treatment in liver, kidney \nand heart transplantation. Efficacy results of the largest studies in each indication are summarised below. \n \nLung transplantation \nThe interim analysis of a recent multicentre study using oral Prograf discussed 110 patients who \nunderwent 1:1 randomisation to either tacrolimus or ciclosporin. Tacrolimus was started as continuous \nintravenous infusion at a dose of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg/day and oral tacrolimus was administered at a dose \nof 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg/day. A lower incidence of acute rejection episodes for tacrolimus- versus \nciclosporin-treated patients (11.5% versus 22.6%) and a lower incidence of chronic rejection, the \nbronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (2.86% versus 8.57%), was reported within the first year after \ntransplantation. The 1-year patient survival rate was 80.8% in the tacrolimus and 83% in the ciclosporin \ngroup. \nAnother randomised study included 66 patients on tacrolimus versus 67 patients on ciclosporin. \nTacrolimus was started as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day and oral \ntacrolimus was administered at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day with subsequent dose adjustments to target \ntrough levels of 10 to 20 ng/ml. The 1-year patient survival was 83% in the tacrolimus and 71% in the \nciclosporin group, the 2-year survival rates were 76% and 66%, respectively. Acute rejection episodes per \n100 patient-days were numerically fewer in the tacrolimus (0.85 episodes) than in the ciclosporin group \n(1.09 episodes). Obliterative bronchiolitis developed in 21.7% of patients in the tacrolimus group \ncompared with 38.0% of patients in the ciclosporin group (p = 0.025). Significantly more ciclosporin-\ntreated patients (n = 13) required a switch to tacrolimus than tacrolimus-treated patients to ciclosporin \n(n = 2) (p = 0.02) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995;60:580). \nIn an additional two-centre study, 26 patients were randomised to the tacrolimus versus 24 patients to the \nciclosporin group. Tacrolimus was started as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day \nand oral tacrolimus was administered at a dose of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/day with subsequent dose adjustments \nto target trough levels of 12 to 15 ng/ml. The 1-year survival rates were 73.1% in the tacrolimus versus \n79.2% in the ciclosporin group. Freedom from acute rejection was higher in the tacrolimus group at 6 \nmonths (57.7% versus 45.8%) and at 1 year after lung transplantation (50% versus 33.3%). \nThe three studies demonstrated similar survival rates. The incidences of acute rejection were numerically \nlower with tacrolimus in all three studies and one of the studies reported a significantly lower incidence of \nbronchiolitis obliterans syndrome with tacrolimus. \n \nPancreas transplantation \nA multicentre study using oral Prograf included 205 patients undergoing simultaneous pancreas-kidney \ntransplantation who were randomised to tacrolimus (n = 103) or to ciclosporin (n = 102). The initial oral \nper protocol dose of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg/kg/day with subsequent dose adjustments to target trough \nlevels of 8 to 15 ng/ml by Day 5 and 5 to 10 ng/ml after Month 6. Pancreas survival at 1 year was \n\n\n\n16 \n\nsignificantly superior with tacrolimus: 91.3% versus 74.5% with ciclosporin (p < 0.0005), whereas renal \ngraft survival was similar in both groups. In total 34 patients switched treatment from ciclosporin to \ntacrolimus, whereas only 6 tacrolimus patients required alternative therapy. \n \nIntestinal transplantation \nPublished clinical experience from a single centre on the use of oral Prograf for primary treatment \nfollowing intestinal transplantation showed that the actuarial survival rate of 155 patients (65 intestine \nalone, 75 liver and intestine, and 25 multivisceral) receiving tacrolimus and prednisone was 75% at \n1 year, 54% at 5 years, and 42% at 10 years. In the early years the initial oral dose of tacrolimus was \n0.3 mg/kg/day. Results continuously improved with increasing experience over the course of 11 years. A \nvariety of innovations, such as techniques for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, \nbone marrow augmentation, the adjunct use of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial \ntacrolimus doses with target trough levels of 10 to 15 ng/ml, and most recently allograft irradiation were \nconsidered to have contributed to improved results in this indication over time. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn man tacrolimus has been shown to be able to be absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. \nAvailable tacrolimus is generally rapidly absorbed. Advagraf is a prolonged-release formulation of \ntacrolimus resulting in an extended oral absorption profile with an average time to maximum blood \nconcentration (Cmax) of approximately 2 hours (tmax). \nAbsorption is variable and the mean oral bioavailability of tacrolimus (investigated with the Prograf \nformulation) is in the range of 20% - 25% (individual range in adult patients 6% - 43%). The oral \nbioavailability of Advagraf was reduced when it was administered after a meal. Both the rate and extent \nof absorption of Advagraf were reduced when administered with food. \nBile flow does not influence the absorption of tacrolimus and therefore treatment with Advagraf may \ncommence orally. \nA strong correlation exists between AUC and whole blood trough levels at steady-state for Advagraf. \nMonitoring of whole blood trough levels therefore provides a good estimate of systemic exposure. \n \nDistribution \nIn man, the disposition of tacrolimus after intravenous infusion may be described as biphasic. \nIn the systemic circulation, tacrolimus binds strongly to erythrocytes resulting in an approximate 20:1 \ndistribution ratio of whole blood/plasma concentrations. In plasma, tacrolimus is highly bound (> 98.8%) \nto plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin and α-1-acid glycoprotein. \nTacrolimus is extensively distributed in the body. The steady-state volume of distribution based on \nplasma concentrations is approximately 1300 l (healthy subjects). Corresponding data based on whole \nblood averaged 47.6 l. \n \nMetabolism \nTacrolimus is widely metabolised in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450-3A4. Tacrolimus is also \nconsiderably metabolised in the intestinal wall. There are several metabolites identified. Only one of these \nhas been shown in vitro to have immunosuppressive activity similar to that of tacrolimus. The other \nmetabolites have only weak or no immunosuppressive activity. In systemic circulation only one of the \ninactive metabolites is present at low concentrations. Therefore, metabolites do not contribute to the \npharmacological activity of tacrolimus. \n \nExcretion \nTacrolimus is a low-clearance substance. In healthy subjects, the average total body clearance estimated \nfrom whole blood concentrations was 2.25 l/h. In adult liver, kidney and heart transplant patients, values \nof 4.1 l/h, 6.7 l/h and 3.9 l/h, respectively, have been observed. Factors such as low haematocrit and \nprotein levels, which result in an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or corticosteroid-induced \nincreased metabolism, are considered to be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed following \ntransplantation. \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe half-life of tacrolimus is long and variable. In healthy subjects, the mean half-life in whole blood is \napproximately 43 hours. \nFollowing intravenous and oral administration of 14C-labelled tacrolimus, most of the radioactivity was \neliminated in the faeces. Approximately 2% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine. Less than 1% \nof unchanged tacrolimus was detected in the urine and faeces, indicating that tacrolimus is almost \ncompletely metabolised prior to elimination: bile being the principal route of elimination. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe kidneys and the pancreas were the primary organs affected in toxicity studies performed in rats and \nbaboons. In rats, tacrolimus caused toxic effects to the nervous system and the eyes. Reversible \ncardiotoxic effects were observed in rabbits following intravenous administration of tacrolimus. \nWhen tacrolimus is administered intravenously as rapid infusion/bolus injection at a dose of 0.1 to 1.0 \nmg/kg, QTc prolongation has been observed in some animal species. Peak blood concentrations achieved \nwith these doses were above 150 ng/mL which is more than 6-fold higher than mean peak concentrations \nobserved with Advagraf in clinical transplantation. \nEmbryofoetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits and was limited to doses that caused significant \ntoxicity in maternal animals. In rats, female reproductive function including birth was impaired at toxic \ndoses and the offspring showed reduced birth weights, viability and growth. \nA negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reduced sperm counts and motility was \nobserved in rats. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \n What is in this leaflet \n1. What Advagraf is and what it is used for \n2.  What you need to know before you take Advagraf \n3. How to take Advagraf \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Advagraf \n6.  Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Advagraf is and what it is used for \nAdvagraf contains the active substance tacrolimus. It is an immunosuppressant. Following your organ \ntransplant (liver, kidney), your body’s immune system will try to reject the new organ. Advagraf is used \nto control your body’s immune response, enabling your body to accept the transplanted organ.  \n \nYou may also be given Advagraf for an ongoing rejection of your transplanted liver, kidney, heart or \nother organ when any previous treatment you were taking was unable to control this immune response \nafter your transplantation. \n \nAdvagraf is used in adults. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Advagraf \n \nDo not take Advagraf \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of Advagraf (see \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are allergic to sirolimus or to any macrolide-antibiotic (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, \n\njosamycin). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nPrograf and Advagraf both contain the active substance, tacrolimus. However, Advagraf is taken once \ndaily, whereas Prograf is taken twice daily. This is because Advagraf capsules allow for a prolonged \nrelease (more slow release over a longer period) of tacrolimus. Advagraf and Prograf are not \ninterchangeable. \n \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n- if you are taking any medicines mentioned below under ‘Other medicines and Advagraf’.  \n- if you have or have had liver problems \n- if you have diarrhoea for more than one day \n\n\n\n46 \n\n- if you feel strong abdominal pain accompanied or not with other symptoms, such as chills, fever, \nnausea or vomiting \n\n- if you have an alteration of the electrical activity of your heart called “QT prolongation”.  \n \nTell your doctor immediately if during treatment you suffer from: \n\nproblems with your vision such as blurred vision, changes in colour vision, difficulty in seeing detail or if \nyour field of vision becomes restricted. \n \nYour doctor may need to adjust your dose of Advagraf. \n \nYou should keep in regular contact with your doctor. From time to time, your doctor may need to do \nblood, urine, heart, eye tests, to set the right dose of Advagraf.  \n \nYou should limit your exposure to the sun and UV (ultraviolet) light whilst taking Advagraf. This is \nbecause immunosuppressants could increase the risk of skin cancer. Wear appropriate protective clothing \nand use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Advagraf is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Advagraf \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal preparations.  \n \nIt is not recommended that Advagraf is taken with ciclosporin (another medicine used for the prevention \nof transplant organ rejection). \n \nAdvagraf blood levels can be affected by other medicines you take, and blood levels of other medicines \ncan be affected by taking Advagraf, which may require interruption, an increase or a decrease in \nAdvagraf dose. In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken \nmedicines like: \n- antifungal medicines and antibiotics, particularly so-called macrolide antibiotics, used to treat \n\ninfections e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clotrimazole, and \nisavuconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin, and rifampicin \n\n- letermovir, used to prevent illness caused by CMV (human cytomegalovirus) \n- HIV protease inhibitors (e.g ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), the booster medicine cobicistat, and \n\ncombination tablets, used to treat HIV infection \n- HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. telaprevir, boceprevir, and the combination \n\nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir), used to treat hepatitis C infection \n- nilotinib and imatinib (used to treat certain cancers) \n- mycophenolic acid, used to suppress the immune system to prevent transplant rejection \n\n- medicines for stomach ulcer and acid reflux (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole or cimetidine) \n- antiemetics, used to treat nausea and vomiting (e.g. metoclopramide) \n- cisapride or the antacid magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide, used to treat heartburn \n- the contraceptive pill or other hormone treatments with ethinylestradiol, hormone treatments with \n\ndanazol \n- medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g. nifedipine, nicardipine, diltiazem \n\nand verapamil) \n- anti-arrhythmic drugs (amiodarone) used to control arrhythmia (uneven beating of the heart) \n- medicines known as “statins” used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides \n- phenytoin or phenobarbital, used to treat epilepsy \n- the corticosteroids prednisolone and methylprednisolone, belonging to the class of corticosteroids \n\nused to treat inflammations or suppress the immune system (e.g. in transplant rejection) \n- nefazodone, used to treat depression \n\n\n\n47 \n\n- Herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or extracts of Schisandra \nsphenanthera. \n\n \nTell your doctor if you are taking or need to take ibuprofen (used to treat fever, inflammation and pain), \namphotericin B (used to treat bacterial infections) or antivirals (used to treat viral infections e.g. \naciclovir). These may worsen kidney or nervous system problems when taken together with Advagraf. \n \nYour doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or certain diuretics used for \nheart failure, hypertension and kidney disease, (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone), non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. ibuprofen) used for fever, inflammation and pain, \nanticoagulants (blood thinners), or oral medicines for diabetes, while you take Advagraf. \n \nIf you need to have any vaccinations, please tell your doctor before. \n \nAdvagraf with food and drink \nAvoid grapefruit (also as juice) while on treatment with Advagraf, since it can affect its levels in the blood. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are, think you might be or are planning to become pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before \nusing Advagraf. \nAdvagraf passes into breast milk. Therefore, you should not breast-feed whilst using Advagraf. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy or sleepy, or have problems seeing clearly \nafter taking Advagraf. These effects are more frequent if you also drink alcohol. \n \nAdvagraf contains lactose, sodium and lecithin (soya) \nAdvagraf contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance \nto some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \nThe printing ink used on Advagraf capsules contains soya lecithin. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, \ntalk to your doctor to determine whether you should use this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Advagraf \n \nAlways take Advagraf exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. This medicine should only be prescribed to you by a doctor with \nexperience in the treatment of transplant patients. \n \nMake sure that you receive the same tacrolimus medicine every time you collect your prescription, unless \nyour transplant specialist has agreed to change to a different tacrolimus medicine. This medicine should \nbe taken once a day. If the appearance of this medicine is not the same as usual, or if dosage instructions \nhave changed, speak to your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible to make sure that you have the right \nmedicine. \n \nThe starting dose to prevent the rejection of your transplanted organ will be determined by your doctor \ncalculated according to your body weight. Initial daily doses just after transplantation will generally be in \nthe range of \n\n0.10 – 0.30 mg per kg body weight per day \n \n\ndepending on the transplanted organ. When treating rejection, these same doses may be used. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nYour dose depends on your general condition and on which other immunosuppressive medication you are \ntaking.  \n \nFollowing the initiation of your treatment with Advagraf, frequent blood tests will be taken by your \ndoctor to define the correct dose. Afterwards regular blood tests by your doctor will be required to define \nthe correct dose and to adjust the dose from time to time. Your doctor will usually reduce your Advagraf \ndose once your condition has stabilised. Your doctor will tell you exactly how many capsules to take. \n \nYou will need to take Advagraf every day as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent rejection of \nyour transplanted organ. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. \n \nAdvagraf is taken orally once daily in the morning. Take Advagraf on an empty stomach or 2 to 3 hours \nafter a meal. Wait at least 1 hour until the next meal. Take the capsules immediately following removal \nfrom the blister. The capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not swallow the \ndesiccant contained in the foil wrapper. \n \nIf you take more Advagraf than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too much Advagraf, contact your doctor or nearest hospital emergency \ndepartment immediately.  \n \nIf you forget to take Advagraf \nIf you have forgotten to take your Advagraf capsules in the morning, take them as soon as possible on the \nsame day. Do not take a double dose the next morning. \n \nIf you stop taking Advagraf \nStopping your treatment with Advagraf may increase the risk of rejection of your transplanted organ. Do \nnot stop your treatment unless your doctor tells you to do so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Advagraf can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAdvagraf reduces your body’s defence mechanism (immune system), which will not be as good at \nfighting infections. Therefore, you may be more prone to infections while you are taking Advagraf. \n \nSevere effects may occur, including allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Benign and malignant tumours \nhave been reported following Advagraf treatment. \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (a very severe reduction in red blood cell counts), agranulocytosis (a \nseverely lowered number of white blood cells), haemolytic anaemia (decreased number of red blood cells \ndue to abnormal breakdown) and febrile neutropenia (a decrease in the type of white blood cells which \nfight infection, accompanied by fever) have been reported.
