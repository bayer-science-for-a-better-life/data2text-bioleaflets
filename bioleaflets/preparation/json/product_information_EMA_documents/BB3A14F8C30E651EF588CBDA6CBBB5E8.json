NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline \nBiologicals 3.75 µg suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAfter mixing, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nSplit influenza virus inactivated, containing antigen* equivalent to: \n \nA/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain used (NIBRG-14) 3.75 micrograms** \n \n* propagated in eggs \n** haemagglutinin \n \nAS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DL-α-tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and \npolysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams) \n \nThe suspension and emulsion vials once mixed form a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the \nnumber of doses per vial. \n \nExcipients: It contains 5 micrograms thiomersal \n \nFor a full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nThe suspension is a colourless light opalescent liquid. \nThe emulsion is a whitish homogeneous liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActive immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. \nThis indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects from the age of 18 years \nonwards following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared from A/VietNam/1194/2004 \nNIBRG-14 (H5N1) (see section 5.1). \n \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline \nBiologicals 3.75 µg should be used in accordance with official guidance.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults from the age of 18 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nBased on very limited data, adults aged >80 years may require a double dose of Prepandemic \ninfluenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg \non an elected date and again after an interval of at least three weeks in order to achieve an immune \nresponse (see section 5.1). \n \nA complete vaccination course with Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg consists of two doses.  However, in the event of an \nofficially declared influenza pandemic, persons previously vaccinated with one or two doses of \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline \nBiologicals 3.75 µg that contained HA antigen derived from a different clade of the same influenza \nsubtype as the pandemic influenza strain may receive a single dose of Pandemrix instead of two doses \nthat are required in previously unvaccinated individuals. \n \nThere is no experience in children. \n \nFor further information, see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection. \n \nIf a double dose is given, the injections should be given into opposite limbs. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of \nthis vaccine. See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 6.1. \n \nAcute severe febrile illness.  Immunisation should be postponed. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to \nresidues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium \ndeoxycholate). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline \nBiologicals 3.75 µg should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. \n \nThere are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of \ninfluenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe vaccine should not usually be given at the same time as other vaccines.  However, if co-\nadministration with another vaccine is considered to be essential, the vaccines should be injected into \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Pregnancy and lactation \n \nNo data have been generated in pregnant women with Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split \nvirion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg or with any other vaccine that \ncontains the AS03 adjuvant. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, \nembryonic/fetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). \n \nHealthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine to \npregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nThere are no data regarding the use of Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg during lactation. The potential benefits \nto the mother and risks to the infant should be considered before administering Prepandemic influenza \nvaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg during \nlactation. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive \nor operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n• Clinical trials \n \nClinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions listed below in approximately 5,000 \nsubjects 18 years old and above who received formulations containing at least 3.75 microgram \nHA/AS03. \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon: lymphadenopathy \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: insomnia \n \nNervous system disorders \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nVery common: headache \nUncommon: paraesthesia, somnolence, dizziness  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon: gastro-intestinal symptoms (such as diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: ecchymosis at the injection site, sweating increased \nUncommon: pruritus, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: arthralgia, myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: induration, swelling, pain and redness at the injection site, fever, fatigue,  \nCommon: shivering, influenza like illness, injection site reactions (such as warmth, pruritus)  \nUncommon: malaise \n \n• Post-marketing surveillance \n \nNo post-marketing surveillance data are available following Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) \n(split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg administration. \n \nFrom Post-marketing surveillance with interpandemic trivalent vaccines, the following adverse \nreactions have been reported: \n \nUncommon:  \nGeneralised skin reactions including urticaria \n \nRare:  \nNeuralgia, convulsions, transient thrombocytopenia. \nAllergic reactions, in rare cases leading to shock, have been reported. \n \nVery rare: \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement. \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome. \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5.

All subjects achieved a neutralising antibody titre of at least 1:80 against each of \nthe two strains regardless of the HA type in the vaccine and the previous number of doses. \n \nIn another clinical study, 39 subjects aged 18-60 years received a dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine \ncontaining 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 fourteen months after they had received two \ndoses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 \nadministered on day 0 and day 21.  The seroprotection rate against A/Indonesia 21 days after booster \nvaccination was 92% and 69.2% at day 180. \n \nInformation from non-clinical studies: \n \nThe ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed \nnon-clinically using ferret challenge models. \n \nIn each experiment, four groups of six ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with an AS03 \nadjuvanted vaccine containing HA derived from H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 (NIBRG-14). Doses of 15, \n5, 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms of HA were tested in the homologous challenge experiment, and doses of 15, \n7.5, 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms of HA were tested in the heterologous challenge experiment. Control \ngroups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone, non-adjuvanted vaccine (15 micrograms HA) \nor phosphate buffered saline solution. Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the \nintra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 or heterologous \nH5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05. Of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected \nagainst the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper \nrespiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk \nof viral transmission. In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all \nanimals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of \nchallenge. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, embryo-fetal and \npostnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n6.

Such \nsituation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for \nrisk-benefit balance in a pandemic.  Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of \nextent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be \nvaccinated.  In addition, duration a pandemic, resources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic \nSafety Update Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal \nProduct in the European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue. \n\n \nIn consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared (Phase 6 of the WHO global Influenza \npreparedness plan) and the prepandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall submit more frequent \nsimplified periodic safety update reports with a format and a periodicity defined in the \"CHMP \nRecommendations for the Core Risk Management Plan for Influenza Vaccines prepared from viruses \nwith the potential to cause a pandemic and intended for use outside of the core dossier context\" \n(EMEA/49993/2008), and any subsequent update. \n \nOfficial batch release: in accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, the official \nbatch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX III \n \n\nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA.

What Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n\nGlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg is and what it is used for \n \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline \nBiologicals 3.75 µg is a vaccine for use in adults from 18 years old. It is intended to be given before or \nduring the next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus. \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of \nordinary flu but are usually more severe. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.  None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu.  \n \nAs with all vaccines, Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \nGlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. Before you receive Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, \n\nadjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg \n \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline \nBiologicals 3.75 µg should not be given: \n \n• if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of \n\nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline \nBiologicals 3.75 µg (these are listed at the end of this leaflet) or to any of the substances that \nmay be present in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, \ngentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or sodium deoxycholate. Signs of an allergic reaction may \ninclude itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n• if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold \nshould not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you can still be vaccinated with \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline \nBiologicals 3.75 µg. \n\n \nDo not have Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \nGlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg if any of the above apply to you.  If you are not sure, talk to \nyour doctor or pharmacist before having this vaccine. \n \nTake special care with Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg: \n \n• if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life threatening allergic reaction to any  \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin \nformaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate. (see section 6. \nFurther information). \n\n• if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be \npoor. \n\n• if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg the results of these tests may not \nbe correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently received Prepandemic \ninfluenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals \n3.75 µg. \n\n \nUsing other medicines or vaccines \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. \n \nThere are no data on the use of Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg given at the same time as other vaccines.
