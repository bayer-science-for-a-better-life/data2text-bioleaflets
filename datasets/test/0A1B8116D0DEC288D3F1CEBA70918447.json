This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nErleada 60 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 60 mg of apalutamide.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nSlightly yellowish to greyish green, oblong-shaped, film-coated tablets (16.7 mm long x 8.7 mm \nwide), debossed with \u201cAR 60\u201d on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nErleada is indicated:\n\uf0b7 in adult men for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC)\n\nwho are at high risk of developing metastatic disease (see section 5.1).\n\uf0b7 in adult men for the treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in \n\ncombination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with apalutamide should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in \nthe medical treatment of prostate cancer.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose is 240 mg (four 60 mg tablets) as an oral single daily dose.\n\nMedical castration with gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) should be continued \nduring treatment in patients not surgically castrated.\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal \nschedule the following day. Extra tablets should not be taken to make up the missed dose.\n\nIf a \u2265 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction is experienced by the patient, dosing should \nbe held rather than permanently discontinuing treatment until symptoms improve to \u2264 Grade 1 or \noriginal grade, then should be resumed at the same dose or a reduced dose (180 mg or 120 mg), if \nwarranted. For the most common adverse reactions, see section 4.8.\n\n\n\n3\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \n\nCaution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as apalutamide has not been studied in \nthis patient population (see section 5.2). If treatment is started, patients should be monitored for the\nadverse reactions listed in section 4.8 and dose reduce as per section 4.2 Posology and method of \nadministration. \n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild or moderate hepatic impairment\n(Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively). \n\nErleada is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment as there are no data in this \npatient population and apalutamide is primarily hepatically eliminated (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of apalutamide in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\nThe tablets should be swallowed whole and can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nWomen who are or may become pregnant (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nSeizure\nErleada is not recommended in patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing factors \nincluding, but not limited to, underlying brain injury, recent stroke (within one year), primary brain \ntumours or brain metastases. If a seizure develops during treatment with Erleada, treatment should be \ndiscontinued permanently. The risk of seizure may be increased in patients receiving concomitant \nmedicinal products that lower the seizure threshold.\n\nIn two randomised studies (SPARTAN and TITAN), seizure occurred in 0.4% of patients receiving \napalutamide and in 0.2% of patients treated with placebo. These studies excluded patients with a \nhistory of seizure or predisposing factors for seizure.\n\nThere is no clinical experience in re-administering Erleada to patients who experienced a seizure.\n\nFalls and fractures\nFalls and fractures occurred in patients receiving apalutamide (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nevaluated for fracture and fall risk before starting Erleada and should continue to be monitored and \nmanaged according to established treatment guidelines and use of bone-targeted agents should be \nconsidered.\n\n\n\n4\n\nIschaemic heart disease\nIschaemic heart disease, including events leading to death, occurred in patients treated with \napalutamide (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had cardiac risk factors. Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of ischaemic heart disease and management of cardiovascular risk \nfactors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidaemia should be optimised as per standard of care.\n\nConcomitant use with other medicinal products \nApalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used \nmedicinal products (see section 4.5). A review of concomitant medicinal products should therefore be \nconducted when apalutamide treatment is initiated. Concomitant use of apalutamide with medicinal \nproducts that are sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters (see section 4.5) \nshould generally be avoided if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and if dose \nadjustments cannot easily be performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations. \n\nCo-administration of apalutamide with warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants should be avoided. \nIf Erleada is co-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin or \nacenocoumarol), additional International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring should be conducted \n(see section 4.5).\n\nRecent cardiovascular disease\nPatients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease in the past 6 months including \nsevere/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, arterial or venous \nthromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident including transient \nischaemic attacks), or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias were excluded from the clinical \nstudies. Therefore, the safety of apalutamide in these patients has not been established. If Erleada is \nprescribed, patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease should be monitored for risk \nfactors such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, or other cardio-metabolic disorders (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be treated, if appropriate, after initiating Erleada for these conditions \naccording to established treatment guidelines.\n\nAndrogen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval\nIn patients with a history of or risk factors for QT prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant \nmedicinal products that might prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5), physicians should assess the \nbenefit-risk ratio including the potential for Torsade de pointes prior to initiating Erleada.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe elimination of apalutamide and formation of its active metabolite, N-desmethyl apalutamide, is \nmediated by both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 to a similar extent at steady-state. No clinically meaningful \nchanges in their overall exposure is expected as a result of drug interaction with inhibitors or inducers\nof CYP2C8 or CYP3A4. Apalutamide is an inducer of enzymes and transporters and may lead to an \nincrease in elimination of many commonly used medicinal products.\n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect apalutamide exposures\n\nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP2C8\nCYP2C8 plays a role in the elimination of apalutamide and in the formation of its active metabolite. In \na drug-drug interaction study, the Cmax of apalutamide decreased by 21% while AUC increased by \n68% following co-administration of apalutamide 240 mg single dose with gemfibrozil (strong \nCYP2C8 inhibitor). For the active moieties (sum of apalutamide plus the potency adjusted active \nmetabolite), Cmax decreased by 21% while AUC increased by 45%. No initial dose adjustment is \nnecessary when Erleada is co-administered with a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil, \nclopidogrel) however, a reduction of the Erleada dose based on tolerability should be considered (see \nsection 4.2). Mild or moderate inhibitors of CYP2C8 are not expected to affect the exposure of \napalutamide.\n\n\n\n5\n\nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4\nCYP3A4 plays a role in the elimination of apalutamide and in the formation of its active metabolite. In \na drug-drug interaction study, the Cmax of apalutamide decreased by 22% while AUC was similar \nfollowing co-administration of Erleada as a 240 mg single dose with itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitor). For the active moieties (sum of apalutamide plus the potency adjusted active metabolite), \nCmax decreased by 22% while AUC was again similar. No initial dose adjustment is necessary when \nErleada is co-administered with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, \nclarithromycin) however, a reduction of the Erleada dose based on tolerability should be considered \n(see section 4.2). Mild or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 are not expected to affect the exposure of \napalutamide.\n\nMedicinal products that induce CYP3A4 or CYP2C8\nThe effects of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducers on the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide have not been \nevaluated in vivo. Based on the drug-drug interaction study results with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or \nstrong CYP2C8 inhibitor, CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducers are not expected to have clinically relevant \neffects on the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide and the active moieties therefore no dose adjustment is \nnecessary when Erleada is co-administered with inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8.\n\nPotential for apalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products\n\nApalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and \ntransporters; therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are substrates of \nenzymes or transporters is expected. The reduction in plasma concentrations can be substantial, and \nlead to lost or reduced clinical effect. There is also a risk of increased formation of active metabolites.\n\nDrug metabolising enzymes\nIn vitro studies showed that apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide are moderate to strong \nCYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers, are moderate inhibitors of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8, and weak \ninhibitors of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide do not \naffect CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. The effect of apalutamide on \nCYP2B6 substrates has not been evaluated in vivo and the net effect is presently unknown. When \nsubstrates of CYP2B6 (e.g., efavirenz) are administered with Erleada, monitoring for an adverse \nreaction and evaluation for loss of efficacy of the substrate should be performed and dose adjustment \nof the substrate may be required to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.\n\nIn humans, apalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and a weak inducer of \nCYP2C9. In a drug-drug interaction study using a cocktail approach, co-administration of apalutamide\nwith single oral doses of sensitive CYP substrates resulted in a 92% decrease in the AUC of \nmidazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), 85% decrease in the AUC of omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), and \n46% decrease in the AUC of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate). Apalutamide did not cause clinically \nmeaningful changes in exposure to the CYP2C8 substrate. Concomitant use of Erleada with medicinal \nproducts that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., darunavir, felodipine, midazolam, \nsimvastatin), CYP2C19 (e.g., diazepam, omeprazole), or CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin) can \nresult in lower exposure to these medicinal products. Substitution for these medicinal products is \nrecommended when possible or evaluation for loss of efficacy should be performed if the medicinal \nproduct is continued. If given with warfarin, INR should be monitored during Erleada treatment.\n\nInduction of CYP3A4 by apalutamide suggests that UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) may also be \ninduced via activation of the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR). Concomitant administration of \nErleada with medicinal products that are substrates of UGT (e.g., levothyroxine, valproic acid) can \nresult in lower exposure to these medicinal products. When substrates of UGT are co-administered \nwith Erleada, evaluation for loss of efficacy of the substrate should be performed and dose adjustment \nof the substrate may be required to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.\n\nDrug transporters\nApalutamide was shown to be a weak inducer of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance \nprotein (BCRP), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) clinically. A drug-drug \n\n\n\n6\n\ninteraction study using a cocktail approach showed that co-administration of apalutamide with single \noral doses of sensitive transporter substrates resulted in a 30% decrease in the AUC of fexofenadine \n(P-gp substrate) and 41% decrease in the AUC of rosuvastatin (BCRP/OATP1B1 substrate) but had no \nimpact on Cmax. Concomitant use of Erleada with medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp (e.g., \ncolchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin), BCRP or OATP1B1 (e.g., lapatinib, methotrexate, \nrosuvastatin, repaglinide) can result in lower exposure of these medicinal products. When substrates of \nP-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 are co-administered with Erleada, evaluation for loss of efficacy of the \nsubstrate should be performed and dose adjustment of the substrate may be required to maintain \noptimal plasma concentrations.\n\nBased on in vitro data, inhibition of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), organic anion transporter 3\n(OAT3) and multidrug and toxin extrusions (MATEs) by apalutamide and its N-desmethyl metabolite \ncannot be excluded. No in vitro inhibition of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) was observed.\n\nGnRH Analog\nIn mHSPC subjects receiving leuprolide acetate (a GnRH analog), co-administration with apalutamide \nhad no apparent effect on the steady-state exposure of leuprolide.\n\nMedicinal products which prolong the QT interval\nSince androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, the concomitant use of Erleada\nwith medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal products able to induce \nTorsade de pointes such as class IA (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g., amiodarone, \nsotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, \nantipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol), etc. should be carefully evaluated (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nIt is not known whether apalutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. Erleada may be harmful \nto a developing foetus. For patients having sex with female partners of reproductive potential, a\ncondom should be used along with another highly effective contraceptive method during treatment and \nfor 3 months after the last dose of Erleada.\n\nPregnancy\nErleada is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant (see section 4.3). Based on its \nmechanism of action, Erleada may cause foetal harm when administered during pregnancy. There are \nno data available from the use of Erleada in pregnant women. Animal reproductive studies have not \nbeen conducted with Erleada.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether apalutamide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling \nchild cannot be excluded. Erleada should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nBased on animal studies, Erleada may decrease fertility in males of reproductive potential (see \nsection 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nErleada has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, seizures \nhave been reported in patients taking Erleada. Patients should be advised of this risk in regards to \ndriving or operating machines.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most common adverse reactions are fatigue (26%), skin rash (26% of any grade and 6% Grade 3 \nor 4), hypertension (22%), hot flush (18%), arthralgia (17%), diarrhoea (16%), fall (13%), and weight \ndecreased (13%). Other important adverse reactions include fractures (11%) and hypothyroidism\n(8%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency \ncategories are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known \n(frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions identified in clinical studies\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction and frequency\nEndocrine disorders common: hypothyroidisma\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders very common: decreased appetite\ncommon: hypercholesterolaemia, \nhypertriglyceridaemia\n\nNervous system disorders common: dysgeusia\n\nuncommon: seizureb (see section 4.4)\nCardiac disorders common: ischaemic heart diseasec\n\nnot known: QT prolongation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5)\nVascular disorders very common: hot flush, hypertension\nGastrointestinal disorders very common: diarrhoea\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders very common: skin rashd\n\ncommon: pruritus\n\nnot known: toxic epidermal necrolysise\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders very common: fracturef, arthralgia\ncommon: muscle spasm\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions\n\nvery common: fatigue\n\nInvestigations very common: weight decreased\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications very common: fall\na Includes hypothyroidism, blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroxine decreased, autoimmune thyroiditis, \n\nthyroxine free decreased, tri-iodothyronine decreased\nb Includes tongue biting\nc Includes angina pectoris, angina unstable, myocardial infarction, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery \n\nocclusion, coronary artery stenosis, acute coronary syndrome, arteriosclerosis coronary artery, cardiac stress test \nabnormal, troponin increased, myocardial ischaemia\n\nd See \u201cSkin rash\u201d under \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d\ne Post-marketing adverse reaction\nf Includes rib fracture, lumbar vertebral fracture, spinal compression fracture, spinal fracture, foot fracture, hip fracture, \n\nhumerus fracture, thoracic vertebral fracture, upper limb fracture, fractured sacrum, hand fracture, pubis fracture,\nacetabulum fracture, ankle fracture, compression fracture, costal cartilage fracture, facial bones fracture, lower limb \nfracture, osteoporotic fracture, wrist fracture, avulsion fracture, fibula fracture, fractured coccyx, pelvic fracture, \nradius fracture, sternal fracture, stress fracture, traumatic fracture, cervical vertebral fracture, femoral neck fracture, \ntibia fracture. See below.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nSkin rash\nSkin rash associated with apalutamide was most commonly described as macular or maculo-papular. \nSkin rash included rash, rash maculo-papular, rash generalised, urticaria, rash pruritic, rash macular, \nconjunctivitis, erythema multiforme, rash papular, skin exfoliation, genital rash, rash erythematous, \n\n\n\n8\n\nstomatitis, drug eruption, mouth ulceration, rash pustular, blister, papule, pemphigoid, skin erosion, \ndermatitis, and rash vesicular. Adverse reactions of skin rash were reported for 26% of patients treated \nwith apalutamide. Grade 3 skin rashes (defined as covering > 30% body surface area [BSA]) were \nreported with apalutamide treatment in 6% of patients.\n\nThe median days to onset of skin rash was 83 days. Seventy-eight percent of patients had resolution of \nrash with a median of 78 days to resolution. Medicinal products utilised included topical \ncorticosteroids, oral anti-histamines, and 19% of patients received systemic corticosteroids. Among \npatients with skin rash, dose interruption occurred in 28% and dose reduction occurred in 14% (see \nsection 4.2). Skin rash recurred in 59% of patients who had dose interruption. Skin rash led to \napalutamide treatment discontinuation in 7% of patients who experienced skin rash.\n\nFalls and fractures\nIn Study ARN-509-003, fracture was reported for 11.7% of patients treated with apalutamide and \n6.5% of patients treated with placebo. Half of the patients experienced a fall within 7 days before the \nfracture event in both treatment groups. Falls were reported for 15.6% of patients treated with \napalutamide versus 9.0% of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4).\n\nIschaemic heart disease\nIn a randomised study (SPARTAN) of patients with nmCRPC, ischaemic heart disease occurred in 4% \nof patients treated with apalutamide and 3% of patients treated with placebo. In a randomised study \n(TITAN) in patients with mHSPC, ischaemic heart disease occurred in 4% of patients treated with \napalutamide and 2% of patients treated with placebo. Across the SPARTAN and TITAN studies, 6\npatients (0.5%) treated with apalutamide and 2 patients (0.2%) treated with placebo died from an \nischaemic heart disease (see section 4.4).\n\nHypothyroidism\nHypothyroidism was reported for 8% of patients treated with apalutamide and 2% of patients treated \nwith placebo based on assessments of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) every 4 months. There were \nno grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Hypothyroidism occurred in 30% of patients already receiving thyroid \nreplacement therapy in the apalutamide arm and in 3% of patients in the placebo arm. In patients not\nreceiving thyroid replacement therapy, hypothyroidism occurred in 7% of patients treated with \napalutamide and in 2% of patients treated with placebo. Thyroid replacement therapy, when clinically \nindicated, should be initiated or dose-adjusted (see section 4.5).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no known specific antidote for apalutamide overdose. In the event of an overdose, Erleada\nshould be stopped and general supportive measures should be undertaken until clinical toxicity has\nbeen diminished or resolved. Adverse reactions in the event of an overdose has not yet been observed, \nit is expected that such reactions would resemble the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, anti-androgens, ATC code: L02BB05\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nMechanism of action\nApalutamide is an orally administered, selective Androgen Receptor (AR) inhibitor that binds directly \nto the ligand-binding domain of the AR. Apalutamide prevents AR nuclear translocation, inhibits \nDNA binding, impedes AR-mediated transcription, and lacks androgen receptor agonist activity.\nApalutamide treatment decreases tumor cell proliferation and increases apoptosis leading to potent\nantitumor activity. A major metabolite, N-desmethyl apalutamide, exhibited one-third the in vitro\nactivity of apalutamide.\n\nCardiac electrophysiology\nThe effect of apalutamide 240 mg once daily on the QTc interval was assessed in an open-label, \nuncontrolled, multi-center, single-arm dedicated QT study in 45 patients with CRPC. At steady-state, \nthe maximum mean QTcF change from baseline was 12.4 ms (2-sided 90% upper CI: 16.0 ms). An \nexposure-QT analysis suggested a concentration-dependent increase in QTcF for apalutamide and its \nactive metabolite.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe efficacy and safety of apalutamide has been established in two Phase 3 randomised, placebo-\ncontrolled studies, Study ARN-509-003 (nmCRPC) and 56021927PCR3002 (mHSPC).\n\nTITAN: Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC)\nTITAN was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multicenter clinical trial in \nwhich 1052 patients with mHSPC were randomised (1:1) to receive either apalutamide orally at a dose \nof 240 mg once daily (N = 525) or placebo once daily (N = 527). All patients were required to have at \nleast one bone metastasis on Technetium 99m bone scan. Patients were excluded if the site of \nmetastases was limited to either the lymph nodes or viscera (e.g., liver or lung). All patients in the \nTITAN trial received concomitant GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Around 11% of \npatients received prior treatment with docetaxel (maximum of 6 cycles, last dose \u22642 months prior to \nrandomisation and maintained response prior to randomisation). The exclusion criteria included\nknown brain metastases; prior treatment with other next generation anti-androgens (eg, enzalutamide), \nCYP17 inhibitors (eg, abiraterone acetate), immunotherapy (eg, sipuleucel-T), radiopharmaceutical \nagents or other treatments for prostate cancer; or history of seizure or condition that may predispose to \nseizure. Patients were stratified by Gleason score at diagnosis, prior docetaxel use, and region of the \nworld. Patients with both high- and low-volume mHSPC were eligible for the study. High-volume \ndisease was defined as either visceral metastases and at least 1 bone lesion or at least 4 bone lesions, \nwith at least 1 bone lesion outside of the vertebral column or pelvis. Low-volume disease was defined \nas the presence of bone lesion(s) not meeting the definition of high-volume.\n\nThe following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the \ntreatment arms. The median age was 68 years (range 43-94) and 23% of patients were 75 years of age \nor older. The racial distribution was 68% Caucasian, 22% Asian, and 2% Black. Sixty-three percent \n(63%) of patients had high-volume disease and 37% had low-volume disease. Sixteen percent (16%) \nof patients had prior surgery, radiotherapy of the prostate or both. A majority of patients had a Gleason \nscore of 7 or higher (92%). Sixty-eight percent (68%) of patients received prior treatment with a first-\ngeneration anti-androgen in the non-metastatic setting. Although criteria for castration resistance were \nnot determined at baseline, 94% of patients demonstrated a decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA)\nfrom initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to first dose of apalutamide or placebo. All \npatients except one in the placebo group, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance \nStatus (ECOG PS) score of 0 or 1 at study entry. Among the patients who discontinued study\ntreatment (N = 271 for placebo and N = 170 for Erleada), the most common reason for discontinuation \nin both arms was disease progression. A greater proportion (73%) of patients treated with placebo \nreceived subsequent anti-cancer therapy compared to patients treated with Erleada (54%).\n\nThe major efficacy outcome measures of the study were overall survival (OS) and radiographic \nprogression-free survival (rPFS). Efficacy results of TITAN are summarised in Table 2 and Figures 1 \nand 2.\n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 2: Summary of Efficacy Results \u2013 Intent-to-treat mHSPC Population (TITAN)\n\nEndpoint\nErleada\nN=525\n\nPlacebo\nN=527\n\nOverall Survival \nDeaths (%) 83 (16%) 117 (22%)\nMedian, months (95% CI) NE (NE, NE) NE (NE, NE)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)a 0.671 (0.507, 0.890)\np-valueb 0.0053\nRadiographic Progression-free Survival \nDisease progression or death (%) 134 (26%) 231 (44%)\nMedian, months (95% CI) NE (NE, NE) 22.08 (18.46, 32.92)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)a 0.484 (0.391, 0.600)\np-valueb <.0001\na Hazard ratio is from stratified proportional hazards model.

Subjects enrolled had a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Doubling Time \n(PSADT) \u2264 10 months, considered to be at high risk of imminent metastatic disease and prostate \ncancer-specific death. All subjects who were not surgically castrated received ADT continuously \nthroughout the study. PSA results were blinded and were not used for treatment discontinuation.\nSubjects randomised to either arm were to continue treatment until disease progression defined by \nblinded central imaging review (BICR), initiation of new treatment, unacceptable toxicity or \nwithdrawal. \n\nThe following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the \ntreatment arms. The median age was 74 years (range 48-97) and 26% of subjects were 80 years of age \nor older. The racial distribution was 66% Caucasian, 5.6% Black, 12% Asian, and 0.2% Other. \nSeventy-seven percent (77%) of subjects in both treatment arms had prior surgery or radiotherapy of \nthe prostate. A majority of subjects had a Gleason score of 7 or higher (81%). Fifteen percent (15%) of \nsubjects had < 2 cm pelvic lymph nodes at study entry. Seventy-three percent (73%) of subjects \nreceived prior treatment with a first generation anti-androgen; 69% of subjects received bicalutamide \nand 10% of subjects received flutamide. All subjects enrolled were confirmed to be non-metastatic by \n\n\n\n12\n\nblinded central imaging review and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status \n(ECOG PS) performance status score of 0 or 1 at study entry.\n\nMetastasis-free survival (MFS) was the primary endpoint, defined as the time from randomisation to \nthe time of first evidence of BICR-confirmed bone or soft tissue distant metastasis or death due to any \ncause, whichever occurred first. Treatment with Erleada significantly improved MFS. Erleada\ndecreased the relative risk of distant metastasis or death by 70% compared to placebo (HR = 0.30; \n95% CI: 0.24, 0.36; p < 0.0001). The median MFS for Erleada was 41 months and was 16 months for \nplacebo (see Figure 3). Consistent improvement in MFS with Erleada was observed for all pre-\nspecified subgroups, including age, race, region of the world, nodal status, prior number of hormonal \ntherapies, baseline PSA, PSA doubling time, baseline ECOG status and use of bone-sparing agents.\n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier metastasis-free survival (MFS) curve in Study ARN-509-003\n\nSubjects treated with Erleada and ADT showed significant improvement over those treated with ADT \nalone for the following secondary endpoints of time to metastasis (HR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.34; \np < 0.0001), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.36; p < 0.0001); time to \nsymptomatic progression (HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.63; p < 0.0001); and a trend for overall survival \n(OS) (HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.47 1.04; p = 0.0742).\n\nTime to symptomatic progression was defined as time from randomization to development of a \nskeletal related event, pain/symptoms requiring initiation of a new systemic anti-cancer therapy, or \nloco-regional tumor progression requiring radiation/surgery. While the overall number of events was \nsmall, the difference between the two arms was sufficiently large to reach statistical significance. In \nthe apalutamide arm 64 (7.9%) subjects developed symptomatic progression compared with 63 (16%) \nin the placebo arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.447 (95% CI: 0.315, 0.634), which met the pre-specified \nO\u2019Brien Fleming type efficacy boundary for significance, p < 0.00008. The median time to \nsymptomatic progression was not reached in either treatment group.\n\nIn the apalutamide arm, 62 (7.7%) subjects died compared to 42 (10.5%) subjects in the placebo arm. \nThe median survival for the apalutamide arm was not reached compared to 39.03 months with a 95% \n\n\n\n13\n\nCI of (39.03, NE) for the placebo arm. Statistical significance was not reached in overall survival at \nthe pre-specified interim analysis.\n\nPost-progression survival (PFS-2, defined as the time to disease progression after first subsequent \ntherapy or death) was longer for subjects treated with Erleada compared to those treated with placebo \n(HR = 0.489; 95%CI: 0.361, 0.662; p < 0.0001).\n\nThere were no statistically significant differences observed in the change from baseline analysis of the \nFunctional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) for the total score or any of the \nsubscales between subjects on Erleada added to ADT versus placebo with ADT.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nErleada in all subsets of the paediatric population in advanced prostate cancer. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollowing repeat once-daily dosing, apalutamide exposure (Cmax and area under the concentration \ncurve [AUC]) increased in a dose-proportional manner across the dose range of 30 to 480 mg. \nFollowing administration of 240 mg once daily, apalutamide steady state was achieved after 4 weeks\nand the mean accumulation ratio was approximately 5-fold relative to a single dose. At steady-state, \nmean (CV%) Cmax and AUC values for apalutamide were 6 \u00b5g/mL (28%) and 100 \u00b5g.h/mL (32%), \nrespectively. Daily fluctuations in apalutamide plasma concentrations were low, with mean \npeak-to-trough ratio of 1.63. An increase in apparent clearance (CL/F) was observed with repeat \ndosing, likely due to induction of apalutamide\u2019s own metabolism.\n\nAt steady-state, the mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC values for the major active metabolite, N-desmethyl \napalutamide, were 5.9 \u00b5g/mL (18%) and 124 \u00b5g.h/mL (19%), respectively. N-desmethyl apalutamide \nis characterised by a flat concentration-time profile at steady-state with a mean peak-to-trough ratio of \n1.27. Mean (CV%) AUC metabolite/parent drug ratio for N-desmethyl apalutamide following \nrepeat-dose administration was about 1.3 (21%). Based on systemic exposure, relative potency, and \npharmacokinetic properties, N-desmethyl apalutamide likely contributed to the clinical activity of \napalutamide.\n\nAbsorption\nAfter oral administration, median time to achieve peak plasma concentration (tmax) was 2 hours (range: \n1 to 5 hours). Mean absolute oral bioavailability is approximately 100%, indicating that apalutamide is \ncompletely absorbed after oral administration.\n\nAdministration of apalutamide to healthy subjects under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal \nresulted in no clinically relevant changes in Cmax and AUC. Median time to reach tmax was delayed \nabout 2 hours with food (see section 4.2).\n\nApalutamide is not ionizable under relevant physiological pH condition, therefore acid lowering \nagents (e.g., proton pump inhibitor, H2-receptor antagonist, antacid) are not expected to affect the \nsolubility and bioavailability of apalutamide.\n\nIn vitro, apalutamide and its N-desmethyl metabolite are substrates for P-gp. Because apalutamide is \ncompletely absorbed after oral administration, P-gp does not limit the absorption of apalutamide and \ntherefore, inhibition or induction of P-gp is not expected to affect the bioavailability of apalutamide.\n\nDistribution\nThe mean apparent volume of distribution at steady-state of apalutamide is about 276 L. The volume \nof distribution of apalutamide is greater than the volume of total body water, indicative of extensive \nextravascular distribution.\n\n\n\n14\n\nApalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide are 96% and 95% bound to plasma proteins, respectively, \nand mainly bind to serum albumin with no concentration dependency.\n\nBiotransformation\nFollowing single oral administration of 14C-labeled apalutamide 240 mg, apalutamide, the active \nmetabolite, N-desmethyl apalutamide, and an inactive carboxylic acid metabolite accounted for the \nmajority of the 14C-radioactivity in plasma, representing 45%, 44%, and 3%, respectively, of the total \n14C-AUC.\n\nMetabolism is the main route of elimination of apalutamide. It is metabolised primarily by CYP2C8 \nand CYP3A4 to form N-desmethyl apalutamide. Apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide are \nfurther metabolised to form the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite by carboxylesterase. The \ncontribution of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of apalutamide is estimated to be 58% and \n13% following single dose but the level of contribution is expected to change at steady-state due to \ninduction of CYP3A4 by apalutamide after repeat dose.\n\nElimination\nApalutamide, mainly in the form of metabolites, is eliminated primarily via urine. Following a single \noral administration of radiolabeled apalutamide, 89% of the radioactivity was recovered up to 70 days \npost-dose: 65% was recovered in urine (1.2% of dose as unchanged apalutamide and 2.7% as \nN-desmethyl apalutamide) and 24% was recovered in feces (1.5% of dose as unchanged apalutamide \nand 2% as N-desmethyl apalutamide).\n\nThe apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of apalutamide is 1.3 L/h after single dosing and increases to \n2.0 L/h at steady-state after once-daily dosing. The mean effective half-life for apalutamide in patients \nis about 3 days at steady-state.\n\nIn vitro data indicate that apalutamide and its N-desmethyl metabolite are not substrates for BCRP, \nOATP1B1 or OATP1B3.\n\nSpecial populations\nThe effects of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, age, race, and other extrinsic factors on the \npharmacokinetics of apalutamide are summarised below.\n\nRenal impairment\nA dedicated renal impairment study for apalutamide has not been conducted. Based on the population \npharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical studies in subjects with castration-resistant prostate \ncancer (CRPC) and healthy subjects, no significant difference in systemic apalutamide exposure was \nobserved in subjects with pre-existing mild to moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate [eGFR] between 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\n; N=585) compared to subjects with baseline \nnormal renal function (eGFR \u2265 90 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\n; N=372). The potential effect of severe renal \nimpairment or end stage renal disease (eGFR \u226429 mL/min/1.73 m2) have not been established due to \ninsufficient data.\n\nHepatic impairment\nA dedicated hepatic impairment study compared the systemic exposure of apalutamide and \nN- desmethyl apalutamide in subjects with baseline mild hepatic impairment (N=8, Child-Pugh Class \nA, mean score = 5.3) or moderate hepatic impairment (N=8, Child-Pugh Class B, mean score = 7.6) \nversus healthy controls with normal hepatic function (N=8). Following a single oral 240 mg dose of \napalutamide, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) for AUC and Cmax for apalutamide in subjects with mild \nimpairment was 95% and 102%, respectively, and the GMR for AUC and Cmax of apalutamide in \nsubjects with moderate impairment was 113% and 104%, respectively, compared to healthy control \nsubjects. Clinical and pharmacokinetic data for apalutamide are not available for patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\n\n\n\n15\n\nEthnicity and race\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no clinically relevant differences in \napalutamide pharmacokinetics between White (Caucasian or Hispanic or Latino; N=761), Black (of \nAfrican heritage or African American; N=71), Asian (non-Japanese; N=58) and Japanese (N=58).\n\nAge\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses showed that age (range: 18 to 94 years) does not have a \nclinically meaningful influence on the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nApalutamide was negative for genotoxicity in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests.\nLong-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of \napalutamide.\n\nMale fertility is likely to be impaired by treatment with apalutamide based on findings in repeat-dose \ntoxicology studies which were consistent with the pharmacological activity of apalutamide. In \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies in male rats and dogs, atrophy, aspermia/hypospermia, degeneration \nand/or hyperplasia or hypertrophy in the reproductive system were observed at doses corresponding to \nexposures approximately equal to the human exposure based on AUC.\n\nIn a fertility study in male rats, a decrease in sperm concentration and motility, copulation and fertility \nrates (upon pairing with untreated females) along with reduced weights of the secondary sex glands \nand epididymis were observed following 4 weeks of dosing at doses corresponding to exposures \napproximately equal to the human exposure based on AUC. Effects on male rats were reversible after \n8 weeks from the last apalutamide administration.\n\n6.
