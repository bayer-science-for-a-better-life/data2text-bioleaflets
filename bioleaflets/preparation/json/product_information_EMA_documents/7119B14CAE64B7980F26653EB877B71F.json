NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\nOmnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\nAfter reconstitution, one vial contains 1.3 mg somatropin* (corresponding to 4 IU) per ml. \n\n* produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nThe powder is white. \nThe solvent is clear and colourless. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nInfants, children and adolescents \n- Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (growth hormone \n\ndeficiency, GHD). \n- Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome. \n- Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency. \n- Growth disturbance (current height standard deviation score (SDS) < -2.5 and parental adjusted \n\nheight SDS < -1) in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA), with a \nbirth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviation (SD), who failed to show catch-up \ngrowth (height velocity (HV) SDS < 0 during the last year) by 4 years of age or later. \n\n- Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for improvement of growth and body composition. The \ndiagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing. \n\nAdults \n- Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.  \n- Adult onset: Patients who have severe growth hormone deficiency associated with multiple \n\nhormone deficiencies as a result of known hypothalamic or pituitary pathology, and who have at \nleast one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin. These patients should \nundergo an appropriate dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone \ndeficiency. \n\n- Childhood onset: Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result of \ncongenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients with childhood onset GHD should \nbe re-evaluated for growth hormone secretory capacity after completion of longitudinal growth. \nIn patients with a high likelihood for persistent GHD, i.e. a congenital cause or GHD secondary \nto a hypothalamic-pituitary disease or insult, an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS < -2 \noff growth hormone treatment for at least 4 weeks should be considered sufficient evidence of \nprofound GHD. \n\nAll other patients will require IGF-I assay and one growth hormone stimulation test. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nDiagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are \nappropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth \ndisorders. \n\nPosology \n\nPaediatric population \nThe posology and administration schedule should be individualised. \n\nGrowth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone in paediatric patients \nGenerally a dose of 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7 - 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per \nday is recommended. Even higher doses have been used. \n\nWhere childhood onset GHD persists into adolescence, treatment should be continued to achieve full \nsomatic development (e.g. body composition, bone mass). For monitoring, the attainment of a normal \npeak bone mass defined as a T score > -1 (i.e. standardized to average adult peak bone mass measured \nby dual energy X-ray absorptiometry taking into account sex and ethnicity) is one of the therapeutic \nobjectives during the transition period. For guidance on dosing see adult section below. \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome, for improvement of growth and body composition in paediatric patients \nGenerally a dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day is \nrecommended. Daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded. Treatment should not be used in \npaediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses. \n\nGrowth disturbance due to Turner syndrome \nA dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day is \nrecommended. \n\nGrowth disturbance in chronic renal insufficiency \nA dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day (1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day) is \nrecommended. Higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low. A dose correction can be \nneeded after six months of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\nGrowth disturbance in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA) \nA dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day (1 mg/m2 body surface area per day) is usually \nrecommended until final height is reached (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued after \nthe first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below + 1. Treatment should be discontinued if \nheight velocity is < 2 cm/year and, if confirmation is required, bone age is > 14 years (girls) or \n> 16 years (boys), corresponding to closure of the epiphyseal growth plates. \n\nDose recommendations in paediatric patients \n\nIndication mg/kg body weight dose per day \nmg/m² body surface \n\narea dose per day \nGrowth hormone deficiency  0.025 - 0.035 0.7 - 1.0 \nPrader-Willi syndrome  0.035 1.0 \nTurner syndrome 0.045 - 0.050 1.4 \nChronic renal insufficiency 0.045 - 0.050 1.4 \nChildren/adolescents born small for \ngestational age (SGA) 0.035 1.0 \n\nGrowth hormone deficient adult patients \nIn patients who continue growth hormone therapy after childhood GHD, the recommended dose to \nrestart is 0.2 – 0.5 mg per day. The dose should be gradually increased or decreased according to \nindividual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I concentration.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIn adults with adult-onset GHD, therapy should start with a low dose, 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day. The dose \nshould be gradually increased according to individual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I \nconcentration. \n\nIn both cases treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) concentrations within 2 SDS \nfrom the age corrected mean. Patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment \nshould be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal, not \nexceeding the 2 SDS. Clinical response and side effects may also be used as guidance for dose \ntitration. It is recognized that there are patients with GHD who do not normalize IGF-I levels despite a \ngood clinical response, and thus do not require dose escalation. The maintenance dose rarely exceeds \n1.0 mg per day. Women may require higher doses than men, with men showing an increasing IGF-I \nsensitivity over time. This means that there is a risk that women, especially those on oral oestrogen \nreplacement are under-treated while men are over-treated. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose \nshould therefore be controlled every 6 months. As normal physiological growth hormone production \ndecreases with age, dose requirements may be reduced. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nIn patients above 60 years, therapy should start with a dose of 0.1 - 0.2 mg per day and should be \nslowly increased according to individual patient requirements. The minimum effective dose should be \nused. The maintenance dose in these patients seldom exceeds 0.5 mg per day. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n\nFor instructions for use and handling see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nSomatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours \nmust be inactive and anti-tumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH therapy. Treatment \nshould be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth. \n\nSomatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. \n\nPatients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated \nwith somatropin (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nThe maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2). \n \nIntroduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol \nconcentrations. In patients treated with somatropin, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) \nhypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required. In addition, \npatients treated with glucocorticoid replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism \nmay require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses, following initiation of somatropin \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n\nUse with oral oestrogen therapy \n\nIf a woman taking somatropin begins oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be \nincreased to maintain the serum IGF-1 levels within the normal age-appropriate range. Conversely, if \na woman on somatropin discontinues oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be \n\n\n\n5 \n\nreduced to avoid excess of growth hormone and/or side effects (see section 4.5). \n\nInsulin sensitivity \n\nSomatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose may \nrequire adjustment after somatropin therapy is instituted. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, \nor additional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy.  \n\nThyroid function \n\nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Whereas the peripheral thyroid hormone \nlevels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects, hypothyroidism theoretically \nmay develop in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. Consequently monitoring of thyroid \nfunction should therefore be conducted in all patients. In patients with hypopituitarism on standard \nreplacement therapy, the potential effect of growth hormone treatment on thyroid function must be \nclosely monitored \n\nIn growth hormone deficiency, secondary to treatment of malignant disease, it is recommended to pay \nattention to signs of relapse of the malignancy. In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a \nsecond neoplasm has been reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. \nIntracranial tumours, in particular meningiomas, in patients treated with radiation to the head for their \nfirst neoplasm, were the most common of these second neoplasms. \n\nIn patients with endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, slipped epiphyses of the \nhip may occur more frequently than in the general population. Patients limping during treatment with \nsomatropin should be examined clinically. \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension \n\nIn case of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of \ngrowth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone \ntreatment is restarted, careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n\nLeukaemia \n\nLeukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, some of \nwhom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that leukaemia incidence is \nincreased in growth hormone recipients without predisposition factors.  \n\nAntibodies \n\nA small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to Omnitrope. Omnitrope has given rise to the \nformation of antibodies in approximately 1% of patients. The binding capacity of these antibodies is \nlow and there is no effect on growth rate. Testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in \nany patient with otherwise unexplained lack of response.  \n\nElderly patients \nExperience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action \nof Omnitrope, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions. \n\nAcute critical illness \n\nThe effects of somatropin on recovery were studied in two placebo controlled trials involving \n522 critically ill adult patients suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure. Mortality was higher in patients \n\n\n\n6 \n\ntreated with 5.3 or 8 mg somatropin daily compared to patients receiving placebo, 42% vs. 19%. \nBased on this information, these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin. As there is no \ninformation available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill \npatients, the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential \nrisks involved. \nIn all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness, the possible benefit of treatment with \nsomatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPancreatitis  \n\nAlthough rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated children who develop \nabdominal pain. \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome \n\nIn patients with PWS, treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet. \n\nThere have been reports of fatalities associated with the use of growth hormone in paediatric patients \nwith PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity (those patients exceeding \na weight/height of 200%), history of respiratory impairment or sleep apnoea or unidentified \nrespiratory infection. Patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk. \n\nBefore initiation of treatment with somatropin patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper \nairway obstruction, sleep apnoea or respiratory infections should be assessed. \n\nIf during the evaluation of upper airway obstruction, pathological findings are observed, the child \nshould be referred to an Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for treatment and resolution of the \nrespiratory disorder prior to initiating growth hormone treatment.  \n\nSleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods \nsuch as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry, and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected. \n\nIf during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset \nof or increased snoring), treatment should be interrupted, and a new ENT assessment performed. \n\nAll patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is \nsuspected.Patients should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections, which should be diagnosed \nas early as possible and treated aggressively. \n\nAll patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during growth hormone \ntreatment. \n\nScoliosis is common in patients with PWS. Scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth. \nSigns of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment.  \n\nExperience with prolonged treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited. \n\nSmall for gestational age \n\nIn short children/adolescents born SGA, other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth \ndisturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment. \n\nIn SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before \nstart of treatment and annually thereafter. In patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus (e.g. \nfamilial history of diabetes, obesity, severe insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans) oral glucose \ntolerance testing (OGTT) should be performed. If overt diabetes occurs, growth hormone should not \nbe administered. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment \nand twice a year thereafter. If on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed +2 SD compared to \nreferences for age and pubertal status, the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to \nconsider dose adjustment. \n\nExperience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited. It is therefore not \nrecommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty. Experience in patients with Silver-Russell \nsyndrome is limited. \n\nSome of the height gain obtained with treating short children/adolescents born SGA with growth \nhormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached. \n\nChronic renal insufficiency \n\nIn chronic renal insufficiency, renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution \nof therapy. To verify growth disturbance, growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of \ntherapy. During this period, conservative treatment for renal insufficiency (which includes control of \nacidosis, hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status) should have been established and should be \nmaintained during treatment. \n\nThe treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation. \n\nTo date, no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are \navailable. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nConcomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of Omnitrope. \nPatients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully \nadjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth. \n\nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nIn women on oral oestrogen replacement, a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to \nachieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4). \n\nData from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin \nadministration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 (e.g. sex \nsteroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and ciclosporin) may be especially increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \nAlso see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for \nstatement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of somatropin in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Somatropin is not recommended \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nThere have been no clinical studies conducted with somatropin containing products in breast-feeding \nwomen. It is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk, but absorption of intact protein \n\n\n\n8 \n\nfrom the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely. Therefore caution should be \nexercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women. \n\nFertility \n\nFertility studies with Omnitrope have not been performed. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nOmnitrope has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nPatients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit. When \ntreatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected. In adult patients adverse reactions \nrelated to fluid retention, such as peripheral oedema, musculoskeletal stiffness, arthralgia, myalgia and \nparaesthesia are common. In general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate, arise within the first \nmonths of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.  \n\nThe incidence of these adverse reactions is related to the administered dose, the age of patients, and \npossibly inversely related to the age of patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency. In children \nsuch adverse reactions are uncommon.  \n\nOmnitrope has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1% of the patients. The \nbinding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with \ntheir formation, see section 4.4.  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTables 1–6 show the adverse reactions ranked under headings of System Organ Class and frequency \nusing the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data) for each of the indicated conditions.  \n\nClinical trials in children with GHD \n\nTable 1 \n\nLong-term treatment of children with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth \nhormone \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon  \n≥ 1/10 \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n<1/10 \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to \n<1/100 \n\nRare \n≥ \n1/10,000 \nto \n<1/1,000 \n\nVery \nRare \n<1/10,000 \n\nNot Known \n(cannot be \nestimated from \navailable data) \n\nNeoplasms \nBenign, \nMalignant and \nUnspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps) \n\n  Leukaemia†    \n\nMetabolism and \nNutrition \nDisorders \n\n     Type 2 diabetes \nmellitus \n\n\n\n9 \n\nNervous System \nDisorders \n\n     Paraesthesia* \n\nBenign \nintracranial \nhypertension \n\nMusculoskeletal, \nConnective \nTissue and Bone \nDisorders \n\n  Arthralgia*   Myalgia* \n\nMusculoskeletal \nstiffness* \n\nGeneral \nDisorders and \nAdministration \nSite Conditions \n\nInjection \nsite \nreaction$ \n \n\n    Oedema \nperipheral* \n\nInvestigations      Blood cortisol \ndecreased‡ \n\n*In general, these adverse effects are mild to moderate, arise within the first months of treatment, and \nsubside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.

The clinical relevance of these findings may be limited. Nevertheless, \ncorticosteroid replacement therapy should be optimised before initiation of therapy.  \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome \n\nIn the post-marketing experience rare cases of sudden death have been reported in patients affected by \nPrader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin, although no causal relationship has been \ndemonstrated. \n\nLeukaemia \n\nCases of leukaemia (rare or very rare) have been reported in growth hormone deficient children treated \nwith somatropin and included in the post-marketing experience. However, there is no evidence of an \nincreased risk of leukaemia without predisposition factors, such as radiation to the brain or head. \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease have been reported in children \ntreated with GH. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs more frequently in case of endocrine \n\n\n\n14 \n\ndisorders and Legg-Calvé-Perthes is more frequent in case of short stature. But it is unknown if these \n2 pathologies are more frequent or not while treated with somatropin. Their diagnosis should be \nconsidered in a child with a discomfort or pain in the hip or knee. \n\nOther adverse drug reactions \n\nOther adverse drug reactions may be considered somatropin class effects, such as possible \nhyperglycaemia caused by decreased insulin sensitivity, decreased free thyroxin level and benign \nintra-cranial hypertension. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSymptoms: \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. \n\nLong-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human \ngrowth hormone excess. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues, ATC code: H01AC01. \n\nOmnitrope is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu \n\nMechanism of action \n\nSomatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates \nand proteins. In children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone, somatropin stimulates linear \ngrowth and increases growth rate. In adults as well as in children, somatropin maintains a normal body \ncomposition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth, and by \nmobilisation of body fat. Visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin. In addition \nto enhanced lipolysis, somatropin decreases the uptake of triglycerides into body fat stores. Serum \nconcentrations of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I) and IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor \nBinding Protein 3) are increased by somatropin. In addition, the following actions have been \ndemonstrated. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nLipid metabolism \nSomatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors, and affects the profile of serum lipids and \nlipoproteins. In general, administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in \nreduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B. A reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be \nobserved. \n\nCarbohydrate metabolism \nSomatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged. Children with \nhypopituitarism may experience fasting hypoglycaemia. This condition is reversed by somatropin. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n15 \n\nWater and mineral metabolism \nGrowth hormone deficiency is associated with decreased plasma and extracellular volumes. Both are \nrapidly increased after treatment with somatropin. Somatropin induces the retention of sodium, \npotassium and phosphorus. \n\nBone metabolism \nSomatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone. Long-term administration of somatropin to \ngrowth hormone deficient patients with osteopenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and \ndensity at weight-bearing sites. \n\nPhysical capacity  \nMuscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with \nsomatropin. Somatropin also increases cardiac output, but the mechanism has yet to be clarified. A \ndecrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nIn clinical trials in short children/adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg/kg body weight \nper day have been used for treatment until final height is reached. In 56 patients who were \ncontinuously treated and have reached (near) final height, the mean change from height at start of \ntreatment was +1.90 SDS (0.033 mg/kg body weight per day) and +2.19 SDS (0.067 mg/kg body \nweight per day). Literature data from untreated SGA children/adolescents without early spontaneous \ncatch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS. Long-term safety data are still limited. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nThe bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80% in both healthy \nsubjects and growth hormone deficient patients. A subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope powder \nand solvent for solution for injection in healthy adults results in plasma Cmax values of 71 ± 24 µg/l \n(mean ± SD) and median tmax value of 4 hours (range 2-8 hours), respectively. \n\nElimination \nThe mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone \ndeficient adults is about 0.4 hours. However, after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope powder \nand solvent for solution for injection, a half-life of 3 hours is achieved. The observed difference is \nlikely due to slow absorption from the injection site following subcutaneous administration. \n\nSpecial populations \nThe absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following \nsubcutaneous administration. \n\nInformation about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations, in \ndifferent races and in patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or \nincomplete. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nIn studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance, no clinically relevant \neffects have been observed. \n\nIn other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity, local tolerance and reproduction toxicity \nno clinically relevant effects have been observed. \n\nWith somatropins, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of \nchromosome aberrations have been negative. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nAn increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken \nfrom patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the \nradiomimetic drug bleomycin. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. \n\nIn another study with somatropin, no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the \nlymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy. \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nInfants, children and adolescents \n- Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (growth hormone \n\ndeficiency, GHD). \n- Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome. \n- Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency. \n- Growth disturbance (current height standard deviation score (SDS) < -2.5 and parental adjusted \n\nheight SDS < -1) in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA), with a \nbirth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviation (SD), who failed to show catch-up \ngrowth (height velocity (HV) SDS < 0 during the last year) by 4 years of age or later. \n\n- Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for improvement of growth and body composition. The \ndiagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing. \n\nAdults \n- Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.  \n- Adult onset: Patients who have severe growth hormone deficiency associated with multiple \n\nhormone deficiencies as a result of known hypothalamic or pituitary pathology, and who have at \nleast one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin. These patients should \nundergo an appropriate dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone \ndeficiency. \n\n- Childhood onset: Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result of \ncongenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients with childhood onset GHD should \nbe re-evaluated for growth hormone secretory capacity after completion of longitudinal growth. \nIn patients with a high likelihood for persistent GHD, i.e. a congenital cause or GHD secondary \nto a hypothalamic-pituitary disease or insult, an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS < -2 \noff growth hormone treatment for at least 4 weeks should be considered sufficient evidence of \nprofound GHD. \n\nAll other patients will require IGF-I assay and one growth hormone stimulation test. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nDiagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are \nappropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth \ndisorders. \n\nPosology \n\nPaediatric population \nThe posology and administration schedule should be individualised. \n\nGrowth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone in paediatric patients \nGenerally a dose of 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7 - 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per \nday is recommended. Even higher doses have been used. \n\nWhere childhood onset GHD persists into adolescence, treatment should be continued to achieve full \nsomatic development (e.g. body composition, bone mass). For monitoring, the attainment of a normal \npeak bone mass defined as a T score > -1 (i.e. standardized to average adult peak bone mass measured \nby dual energy X-ray absorptiometry taking into account sex and ethnicity) is one of the therapeutic \nobjectives during the transition period. For guidance on dosing see adult section below. \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome, for improvement of growth and body composition in paediatric patients \nGenerally a dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day is \nrecommended. Daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded. Treatment should not be used in \npaediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses. \n\nGrowth disturbance due to Turner syndrome \nA dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day is \nrecommended. \n\nGrowth disturbance in chronic renal insufficiency \nA dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day (1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day) is \nrecommended. Higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low. A dose correction can be \nneeded after six months of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\nGrowth disturbance in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA) \nA dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day (1 mg/m2 body surface area per day) is usually \nrecommended until final height is reached (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued after \nthe first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below + 1. Treatment should be discontinued if \nheight velocity is < 2 cm/year and, if confirmation is required, bone age is > 14 years (girls) or \n> 16 years (boys), corresponding to closure of the epiphyseal growth plates. \n\nDose recommendations in paediatric patients \n\nIndication mg/kg body weight dose per day \nmg/m² body surface \n\narea dose per day \nGrowth hormone deficiency  0.025 - 0.035 0.7 - 1.0 \nPrader-Willi syndrome  0.035 1.0 \nTurner syndrome 0.045 - 0.050 1.4 \nChronic renal insufficiency 0.045 - 0.050 1.4 \nChildren/adolescents born small for \ngestational age (SGA) 0.035 1.0 \n\nGrowth hormone deficient adult patients \nIn patients who continue growth hormone therapy after childhood GHD, the recommended dose to \nrestart is 0.2 – 0.5 mg per day. The dose should be gradually increased or decreased according to \nindividual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I concentration.  \n\n\n\n20 \n\nIn adults with adult-onset GHD, therapy should start with a low dose, 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day. The dose \nshould be gradually increased according to individual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I \nconcentration. \n\nIn both cases treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) concentrations within 2 SDS \nfrom the age corrected mean. Patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment \nshould be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal, not \nexceeding the 2 SDS. Clinical response and side effects may also be used as guidance for dose \ntitration. It is recognized that there are patients with GHD who do not normalize IGF-I levels despite a \ngood clinical response, and thus do not require dose escalation. The maintenance dose rarely exceeds \n1.0 mg per day. Women may require higher doses than men, with men showing an increasing IGF-I \nsensitivity over time. This means that there is a risk that women, especially those on oral oestrogen \nreplacement are under-treated while men are over-treated. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose \nshould therefore be controlled every 6 months. As normal physiological growth hormone production \ndecreases with age, dose requirements may be reduced. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nIn patients above 60 years, therapy should start with a dose of 0.1 - 0.2 mg per day and should be \nslowly increased according to individual patient requirements. The minimum effective dose should be \nused. The maintenance dose in these patients seldom exceeds 0.5 mg per day. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n\nFor instructions for use and handling see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nSomatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours \nmust be inactive and anti-tumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH therapy. Treatment \nshould be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth. \n\nSomatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. \n\nPatients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated \nwith somatropin (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nThe maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2). \n \nIntroduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol \nconcentrations. In patients treated with somatropin, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) \nhypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required. In addition, \npatients treated with glucocorticoid replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism \nmay require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses, following initiation of somatropin \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n\nUse with oral oestrogen therapy \n\nIf a woman taking somatropin begins oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be \nincreased to maintain the serum IGF-1 levels within the normal age-appropriate range. Conversely, if \na woman on somatropin discontinues oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be \n\n\n\n21 \n\nreduced to avoid excess of growth hormone and/or side effects (see section 4.5). \n\nInsulin sensitivity \n\nSomatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose may \nrequire adjustment after somatropin therapy is instituted. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, \nor additional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy.  \n\nThyroid function \n\nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Whereas the peripheral thyroid hormone \nlevels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects, hypothyroidism theoretically \nmay develop in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. Consequently monitoring of thyroid \nfunction should therefore be conducted in all patients. In patients with hypopituitarism on standard \nreplacement therapy, the potential effect of growth hormone treatment on thyroid function must be \nclosely monitored \n\nIn growth hormone deficiency, secondary to treatment of malignant disease, it is recommended to pay \nattention to signs of relapse of the malignancy. In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a \nsecond neoplasm has been reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. \nIntracranial tumours, in particular meningiomas, in patients treated with radiation to the head for their \nfirst neoplasm, were the most common of these second neoplasms. \n\nIn patients with endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, slipped epiphyses of the \nhip may occur more frequently than in the general population. Patients limping during treatment with \nsomatropin should be examined clinically. \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension \n\nIn case of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of \ngrowth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone \ntreatment is restarted, careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n\nLeukaemia \n\nLeukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, some of \nwhom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that leukaemia incidence is \nincreased in growth hormone recipients without predisposition factors.  \n\nAntibodies \n\nA small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to Omnitrope. Omnitrope has given rise to the \nformation of antibodies in approximately 1% of patients. The binding capacity of these antibodies is \nlow and there is no effect on growth rate. Testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in \nany patient with otherwise unexplained lack of response.  \n\nElderly patients \nExperience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action \nof Omnitrope, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions. \n\nAcute critical illness \n\nThe effects of somatropin on recovery were studied in two placebo controlled trials involving \n522 critically ill adult patients suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure. Mortality was higher in patients \n\n\n\n22 \n\ntreated with 5.3 or 8 mg somatropin daily compared to patients receiving placebo, 42% vs. 19%. \nBased on this information, these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin. As there is no \ninformation available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill \npatients, the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential \nrisks involved. \nIn all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness, the possible benefit of treatment with \nsomatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPancreatitis  \n\nAlthough rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated children who develop \nabdominal pain. \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome \n\nIn patients with PWS, treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet. \n\nThere have been reports of fatalities associated with the use of growth hormone in paediatric patients \nwith PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity (those patients exceeding \na weight/height of 200%), history of respiratory impairment or sleep apnoea or unidentified \nrespiratory infection. Patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk. \n\nBefore initiation of treatment with somatropin patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper \nairway obstruction, sleep apnoea or respiratory infections should be assessed. \n\nIf during the evaluation of upper airway obstruction, pathological findings are observed, the child \nshould be referred to an Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for treatment and resolution of the \nrespiratory disorder prior to initiating growth hormone treatment.  \n\nSleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods \nsuch as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry, and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected. \n\nIf during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset \nof or increased snoring), treatment should be interrupted, and a new ENT assessment performed. \n\nAll patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is \nsuspected.Patients should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections, which should be diagnosed \nas early as possible and treated aggressively. \n\nAll patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during growth hormone \ntreatment. \n\nScoliosis is common in patients with PWS. Scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth. \nSigns of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment.  \n\nExperience with prolonged treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited. \n\nSmall for gestational age \n\nIn short children/adolescents born SGA, other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth \ndisturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment. \n\nIn SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before \nstart of treatment and annually thereafter. In patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus (e.g. \nfamilial history of diabetes, obesity, severe insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans) oral glucose \ntolerance testing (OGTT) should be performed. If overt diabetes occurs, growth hormone should not \nbe administered. \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIn SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment \nand twice a year thereafter. If on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed +2 SD compared to \nreferences for age and pubertal status, the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to \nconsider dose adjustment. \n\nExperience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited. It is therefore not \nrecommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty. Experience in patients with Silver-Russell \nsyndrome is limited. \n\nSome of the height gain obtained with treating short children/adolescents born SGA with growth \nhormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached. \n\nChronic renal insufficiency \n\nIn chronic renal insufficiency, renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution \nof therapy. To verify growth disturbance, growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of \ntherapy. During this period, conservative treatment for renal insufficiency (which includes control of \nacidosis, hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status) should have been established and should be \nmaintained during treatment. \n\nThe treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation. \n\nTo date, no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are \navailable. \n\nBecause of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature \nbabies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up \nto 3 years old. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nConcomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of Omnitrope. \nPatients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully \nadjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth. \n\nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nIn women on oral oestrogen replacement, a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to \nachieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4). \n\nData from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin \nadministration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 (e.g. sex \nsteroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and ciclosporin) may be especially increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \nAlso see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for \nstatement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of somatropin in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Somatropin is not recommended \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nThere have been no clinical studies conducted with somatropin containing products in breast-feeding \nwomen. It is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk, but absorption of intact protein \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely. Therefore caution should be \nexercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women. \n\nFertility \n\nFertility studies with Omnitrope have not been performed. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nOmnitrope has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nPatients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit. When \ntreatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected. In adult patients adverse reactions \nrelated to fluid retention, such as peripheral oedema, musculoskeletal stiffness, arthralgia, myalgia and \nparaesthesia are common. In general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate, arise within the first \nmonths of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.  \n\nThe incidence of these adverse reactions is related to the administered dose, the age of patients, and \npossibly inversely related to the age of patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency. In children \nsuch adverse reactions are uncommon.  \n\nOmnitrope has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1% of the patients. The \nbinding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with \ntheir formation, see section 4.4.  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTables 1–6 show the adverse reactions ranked under headings of System Organ Class and frequency \nusing the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data) for each of the indicated conditions.  \n\nClinical trials in children with GHD \n\nTable 1 \n\nLong-term treatment of children with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth \nhormone \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon  \n≥ 1/10 \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n<1/10 \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to \n<1/100 \n\nRare \n≥ \n1/10,000 \nto \n<1/1,000 \n\nVery \nRare \n<1/10,000 \n\nNot Known \n(cannot be \nestimated from \navailable data) \n\nNeoplasms \nBenign, \nMalignant and \nUnspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps) \n\n  Leukaemia†    \n\n\n\n25 \n\nMetabolism and \nNutrition \nDisorders \n\n     Type 2 diabetes \nmellitus \n\nNervous System \nDisorders \n\n     Paraesthesia* \n\nBenign \nintracranial \nhypertension \n\nMusculoskeletal, \nConnective \nTissue and Bone \nDisorders \n\n  Arthralgia*   Myalgia* \n\nMusculoskeletal \nstiffness* \n\nGeneral \nDisorders and \nAdministration \nSite Conditions \n\nInjection \nsite \nreaction$ \n \n\n    Oedema \nperipheral* \n\nInvestigations      Blood cortisol \ndecreased‡ \n\n*In general, these adverse effects are mild to moderate, arise within the first months of treatment, and \nsubside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.

However, there is no evidence of an \nincreased risk of leukaemia without predisposition factors, such as radiation to the brain or head. \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease have been reported in children \ntreated with GH. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs more frequently in case of endocrine \ndisorders and Legg-Calvé-Perthes is more frequent in case of short stature. But it is unknown if these \n\n\n\n30 \n\n2 pathologies are more frequent or not while treated with somatropin. Their diagnosis should be \nconsidered in a child with a discomfort or pain in the hip or knee. \n\nOther adverse drug reactions \n\nOther adverse drug reactions may be considered somatropin class effects, such as possible \nhyperglycaemia caused by decreased insulin sensitivity, decreased free thyroxin level and benign \nintra-cranial hypertension. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSymptoms: \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. \n\nLong-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human \ngrowth hormone excess. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues, ATC code: H01AC01. \n\nOmnitrope is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu \n\nMechanism of action \n\nSomatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates \nand proteins. In children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone, somatropin stimulates linear \ngrowth and increases growth rate. In adults as well as in children, somatropin maintains a normal body \ncomposition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth, and by \nmobilisation of body fat. Visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin. In addition \nto enhanced lipolysis, somatropin decreases the uptake of triglycerides into body fat stores. Serum \nconcentrations of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I) and IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor \nBinding Protein 3) are increased by somatropin. In addition, the following actions have been \ndemonstrated. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nLipid metabolism \nSomatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors, and affects the profile of serum lipids and \nlipoproteins. In general, administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in \nreduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B. A reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be \nobserved. \n\nCarbohydrate metabolism \nSomatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged. Children with \nhypopituitarism may experience fasting hypoglycaemia. This condition is reversed by somatropin. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n31 \n\nWater and mineral metabolism \nGrowth hormone deficiency is associated with decreased plasma and extracellular volumes. Both are \nrapidly increased after treatment with somatropin. Somatropin induces the retention of sodium, \npotassium and phosphorus. \n\nBone metabolism \nSomatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone. Long-term administration of somatropin to \ngrowth hormone deficient patients with osteopenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and \ndensity at weight-bearing sites. \n\nPhysical capacity  \nMuscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with \nsomatropin. Somatropin also increases cardiac output, but the mechanism has yet to be clarified. A \ndecrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nIn clinical trials in short children/adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg/kg body weight \nper day have been used for treatment until final height is reached. In 56 patients who were \ncontinuously treated and have reached (near) final height, the mean change from height at start of \ntreatment was +1.90 SDS (0.033 mg/kg body weight per day) and +2.19 SDS (0.067 mg/kg body \nweight per day). Literature data from untreated SGA children/adolescents without early spontaneous \ncatch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS. Long-term safety data are still limited. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nThe bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80% in both healthy \nsubjects and growth hormone deficient patients. A subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope powder \nand solvent for solution for injection in healthy adults results in plasma Cmax values of 71 ± 24 µg/l \n(mean ± SD) and median tmax value of 4 hours (range 2-8 hours), respectively. \n\nElimination \nThe mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone \ndeficient adults is about 0.4 hours. However, after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 5 mg/ml \npowder and solvent for solution for injection, a half-life of 3 hours is achieved. The observed \ndifference is likely due to slow absorption from the injection site following subcutaneous \nadministration. \n\nSpecial populations \nThe absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following \nsubcutaneous administration. \n\nInformation about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations, in \ndifferent races and in patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or \nincomplete. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nIn studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance, no clinically relevant \neffects have been observed. \n\nIn other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity, local tolerance and reproduction toxicity \nno clinically relevant effects have been observed. \n\nWith somatropins, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of \nchromosome aberrations have been negative. \n\n\n\n32 \n\nAn increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken \nfrom patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the \nradiomimetic drug bleomycin. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. \n\nIn another study with somatropin, no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the \nlymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy. \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\nSolution for injection. \nThe solution is clear and colourless. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nInfants, children and adolescents \n- Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (growth hormone \n\ndeficiency, GHD). \n- Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome. \n- Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency. \n- Growth disturbance (current height standard deviation score (SDS) < -2.5 and parental adjusted \n\nheight SDS < -1) in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA), with a \nbirth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviation (SD), who failed to show catch-up \ngrowth (height velocity (HV) SDS < 0 during the last year) by 4 years of age or later. \n\n- Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for improvement of growth and body composition. The \ndiagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing. \n\nAdults \n- Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.  \n- Adult onset: Patients who have severe growth hormone deficiency associated with multiple \n\nhormone deficiencies as a result of known hypothalamic or pituitary pathology, and who have at \nleast one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin. These patients should \nundergo an appropriate dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone \ndeficiency. \n\n- Childhood onset: Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result of \ncongenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients with childhood onset GHD should \nbe re-evaluated for growth hormone secretory capacity after completion of longitudinal growth. \nIn patients with a high likelihood for persistent GHD, i.e. a congenital cause or GHD secondary \n\n\n\n35 \n\nto a hypothalamic-pituitary disease or insult, an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS < -2 \noff growth hormone treatment for at least 4 weeks should be considered sufficient evidence of \nprofound GHD. \n\nAll other patients will require IGF-I assay and one growth hormone stimulation test. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nDiagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are \nappropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth \ndisorders. \n\nPosology \n\nPaediatric population \nThe posology and administration schedule should be individualised. \n\nGrowth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone in paediatric patients \nGenerally a dose of 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7 - 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per \nday is recommended. Even higher doses have been used. \n\nWhere childhood onset GHD persists into adolescence, treatment should be continued to achieve full \nsomatic development (e.g. body composition, bone mass). For monitoring, the attainment of a normal \npeak bone mass defined as a T score > -1 (i.e. standardized to average adult peak bone mass measured \nby dual energy X-ray absorptiometry taking into account sex and ethnicity) is one of the therapeutic \nobjectives during the transition period. For guidance on dosing see adult section below. \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome, for improvement of growth and body composition in paediatric patients \nGenerally a dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day is \nrecommended. Daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded. Treatment should not be used in \npaediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses. \n\nGrowth disturbance due to Turner syndrome \nA dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day is \nrecommended. \n\nGrowth disturbance in chronic renal insufficiency \nA dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day (1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day) is \nrecommended. Higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low. A dose correction can be \nneeded after six months of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\nGrowth disturbance in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA) \nA dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day (1 mg/m2 body surface area per day) is usually \nrecommended until final height is reached (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued after \nthe first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below + 1. Treatment should be discontinued if \nheight velocity is < 2 cm/year and, if confirmation is required, bone age is > 14 years (girls) or \n> 16 years (boys), corresponding to closure of the epiphyseal growth plates. \n\n\n\n36 \n\nDose recommendations in paediatric patients \n\nIndication mg/kg body weight dose per day \nmg/m² body surface \n\narea dose per day \nGrowth hormone deficiency  0.025 - 0.035 0.7 - 1.0 \nPrader-Willi syndrome  0.035 1.0 \nTurner syndrome 0.045 - 0.050 1.4 \nChronic renal insufficiency 0.045 - 0.050 1.4 \nChildren/adolescents born small for \ngestational age (SGA) 0.035 1.0 \n\nGrowth hormone deficient adult patients \nIn patients who continue growth hormone therapy after childhood GHD, the recommended dose to \nrestart is 0.2 – 0.5 mg per day. The dose should be gradually increased or decreased according to \nindividual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I concentration.  \n\nIn adults with adult-onset GHD, therapy should start with a low dose, 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day. The dose \nshould be gradually increased according to individual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I \nconcentration. \n\nIn both cases treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) concentrations within 2 SDS \nfrom the age corrected mean. Patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment \nshould be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal, not \nexceeding the 2 SDS. Clinical response and side effects may also be used as guidance for dose \ntitration. It is recognized that there are patients with GHD who do not normalize IGF-I levels despite a \ngood clinical response, and thus do not require dose escalation. The maintenance dose rarely exceeds \n1.0 mg per day. Women may require higher doses than men, with men showing an increasing IGF-I \nsensitivity over time. This means that there is a risk that women, especially those on oral oestrogen \nreplacement are under-treated while men are over-treated. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose \nshould therefore be controlled every 6 months. As normal physiological growth hormone production \ndecreases with age, dose requirements may be reduced. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nIn patients above 60 years, therapy should start with a dose of 0.1 - 0.2 mg per day and should be \nslowly increased according to individual patient requirements. The minimum effective dose should be \nused. The maintenance dose in these patients seldom exceeds 0.5 mg per day. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n\nFor instructions for use and handling see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nSomatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours \nmust be inactive and anti-tumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH therapy. Treatment \nshould be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth. \n\nSomatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. \n\nPatients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated \nwith somatropin (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n37 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nThe maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2). \n \nIntroduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol \nconcentrations. In patients treated with somatropin, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) \nhypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required. In addition, \npatients treated with glucocorticoid replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism \nmay require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses, following initiation of somatropin \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n\nUse with oral oestrogen therapy \n\nIf a woman taking somatropin begins oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be \nincreased to maintain the serum IGF-1 levels within the normal age-appropriate range. Conversely, if \na woman on somatropin discontinues oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be \nreduced to avoid excess of growth hormone and/or side effects (see section 4.5). \n\nInsulin sensitivity \n\nSomatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose may \nrequire adjustment after somatropin therapy is instituted. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, \nor additional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy.  \n\nThyroid function \n\nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Whereas the peripheral thyroid hormone \nlevels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects, hypothyroidism theoretically \nmay develop in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. Consequently monitoring of thyroid \nfunction should therefore be conducted in all patients. In patients with hypopituitarism on standard \nreplacement therapy, the potential effect of growth hormone treatment on thyroid function must be \nclosely monitored \n\nIn growth hormone deficiency, secondary to treatment of malignant disease, it is recommended to pay \nattention to signs of relapse of the malignancy. In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a \nsecond neoplasm has been reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. \nIntracranial tumours, in particular meningiomas, in patients treated with radiation to the head for their \nfirst neoplasm, were the most common of these second neoplasms. \n\nIn patients with endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, slipped epiphyses of the \nhip may occur more frequently than in the general population. Patients limping during treatment with \nsomatropin should be examined clinically. \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension \n\nIn case of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of \ngrowth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone \ntreatment is restarted, careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n\nLeukaemia \n\nLeukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, some of \nwhom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that leukaemia incidence is \nincreased in growth hormone recipients without predisposition factors.  \n\n\n\n38 \n\nAntibodies \n\nA small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to Omnitrope. Omnitrope has given rise to the \nformation of antibodies in approximately 1% of patients. The binding capacity of these antibodies is \nlow and there is no effect on growth rate. Testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in \nany patient with otherwise unexplained lack of response.  \n\nElderly patients \nExperience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action \nof Omnitrope, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions. \n\nAcute critical illness \n\nThe effects of somatropin on recovery were studied in two placebo controlled trials involving \n522 critically ill adult patients suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure. Mortality was higher in patients \ntreated with 5.3 or 8 mg somatropin daily compared to patients receiving placebo, 42% vs. 19%. \nBased on this information, these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin. As there is no \ninformation available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill \npatients, the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential \nrisks involved. \nIn all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness, the possible benefit of treatment with \nsomatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPancreatitis  \n\nAlthough rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated children who develop \nabdominal pain. \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome \n\nIn patients with PWS, treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet. \n\nThere have been reports of fatalities associated with the use of growth hormone in paediatric patients \nwith PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity (those patients exceeding \na weight/height of 200%), history of respiratory impairment or sleep apnoea or unidentified \nrespiratory infection. Patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk. \n\nBefore initiation of treatment with somatropin patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper \nairway obstruction, sleep apnoea or respiratory infections should be assessed. \n\nIf during the evaluation of upper airway obstruction, pathological findings are observed, the child \nshould be referred to an Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for treatment and resolution of the \nrespiratory disorder prior to initiating growth hormone treatment.  \n\nSleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods \nsuch as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry, and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected. \n\nIf during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset \nof or increased snoring), treatment should be interrupted, and a new ENT assessment performed. \n\nAll patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is \nsuspected.Patients should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections, which should be diagnosed \nas early as possible and treated aggressively. \n\nAll patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during growth hormone \ntreatment. \n\n\n\n39 \n\nScoliosis is common in patients with PWS. Scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth. \nSigns of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment.  \n\nExperience with prolonged treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited. \n\nSmall for gestational age \n\nIn short children/adolescents born SGA, other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth \ndisturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment. \n\nIn SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before \nstart of treatment and annually thereafter. In patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus (e.g. \nfamilial history of diabetes, obesity, severe insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans) oral glucose \ntolerance testing (OGTT) should be performed. If overt diabetes occurs, growth hormone should not \nbe administered. \n\nIn SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment \nand twice a year thereafter. If on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed +2 SD compared to \nreferences for age and pubertal status, the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to \nconsider dose adjustment. \n\nExperience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited. It is therefore not \nrecommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty. Experience in patients with Silver-Russell \nsyndrome is limited. \n\nSome of the height gain obtained with treating short children/adolescents born SGA with growth \nhormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached. \n\nChronic renal insufficiency \n\nIn chronic renal insufficiency, renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution \nof therapy. To verify growth disturbance, growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of \ntherapy. During this period, conservative treatment for renal insufficiency (which includes control of \nacidosis, hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status) should have been established and should be \nmaintained during treatment. \n\nThe treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation. \n\nTo date, no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are \navailable. \n\nOmnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection: \nBecause of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature \nbabies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up \nto 3 years old. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nConcomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of Omnitrope. \nPatients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully \nadjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth. \n\nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nIn women on oral oestrogen replacement, a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to \nachieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n40 \n\nData from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin \nadministration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 (e.g. sex \nsteroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and ciclosporin) may be especially increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \nAlso see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for \nstatement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of somatropin in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Somatropin is not recommended \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nThere have been no clinical studies conducted with somatropin containing products in breast-feeding \nwomen. It is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk, but absorption of intact protein \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely. Therefore caution should be \nexercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women. \n\nFertility \n\nFertility studies with Omnitrope have not been performed. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nOmnitrope has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nPatients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit. When \ntreatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected. In adult patients adverse reactions \nrelated to fluid retention, such as peripheral oedema, musculoskeletal stiffness, arthralgia, myalgia and \nparaesthesia are common. In general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate, arise within the first \nmonths of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.  \n\nThe incidence of these adverse reactions is related to the administered dose, the age of patients, and \npossibly inversely related to the age of patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency. In children \nsuch adverse reactions are uncommon.  \n\nOmnitrope has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1% of the patients. The \nbinding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with \ntheir formation, see section 4.4.  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTables 1–6 show the adverse reactions ranked under headings of System Organ Class and frequency \nusing the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data) for each of the indicated conditions.  \n\n\n\n41 \n\nClinical trials in children with GHD \n\nTable 1 \n\nLong-term treatment of children with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth \nhormone \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon  \n≥ 1/10 \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n<1/10 \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to \n<1/100 \n\nRare \n≥ \n1/10,000 \nto \n<1/1,000 \n\nVery \nRare \n<1/10,000 \n\nNot Known \n(cannot be \nestimated from \navailable data) \n\nNeoplasms \nBenign, \nMalignant and \nUnspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps) \n\n  Leukaemia†    \n\nMetabolism and \nNutrition \nDisorders \n\n     Type 2 diabetes \nmellitus \n\nNervous System \nDisorders \n\n     Paraesthesia* \n\nBenign \nintracranial \nhypertension \n\nMusculoskeletal, \nConnective \nTissue and Bone \nDisorders \n\n  Arthralgia*   Myalgia* \n\nMusculoskeletal \nstiffness* \n\nGeneral \nDisorders and \nAdministration \nSite Conditions \n\nInjection \nsite \nreaction$ \n \n\n    Oedema \nperipheral* \n\nInvestigations      Blood cortisol \ndecreased‡ \n\n*In general, these adverse effects are mild to moderate, arise within the first months of treatment, and \nsubside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.

The clinical relevance of these findings may be limited. Nevertheless, \ncorticosteroid replacement therapy should be optimised before initiation of therapy.  \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome \n\nIn the post-marketing experience rare cases of sudden death have been reported in patients affected by \nPrader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin, although no causal relationship has been \ndemonstrated. \n\nLeukaemia \n\nCases of leukaemia (rare or very rare) have been reported in growth hormone deficient children treated \nwith somatropin and included in the post-marketing experience. However, there is no evidence of an \nincreased risk of leukaemia without predisposition factors, such as radiation to the brain or head. \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease have been reported in children \ntreated with GH. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs more frequently in case of endocrine \ndisorders and Legg-Calvé-Perthes is more frequent in case of short stature. But it is unknown if these \n2 pathologies are more frequent or not while treated with somatropin. Their diagnosis should be \nconsidered in a child with a discomfort or pain in the hip or knee. \n\nOther adverse drug reactions \n\nOther adverse drug reactions may be considered somatropin class effects, such as possible \nhyperglycaemia caused by decreased insulin sensitivity, decreased free thyroxin level and benign \nintra-cranial hypertension. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSymptoms: \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. \n\nLong-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human \ngrowth hormone excess. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues, ATC code: H01AC01. \n\nOmnitrope is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu \n\nMechanism of action \n\nSomatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates \nand proteins. In children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone, somatropin stimulates linear \ngrowth and increases growth rate. In adults as well as in children, somatropin maintains a normal body \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n47 \n\ncomposition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth, and by \nmobilisation of body fat. Visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin. In addition \nto enhanced lipolysis, somatropin decreases the uptake of triglycerides into body fat stores. Serum \nconcentrations of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I) and IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor \nBinding Protein 3) are increased by somatropin. In addition, the following actions have been \ndemonstrated. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nLipid metabolism \nSomatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors, and affects the profile of serum lipids and \nlipoproteins. In general, administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in \nreduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B. A reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be \nobserved. \n\nCarbohydrate metabolism \nSomatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged. Children with \nhypopituitarism may experience fasting hypoglycaemia. This condition is reversed by somatropin. \n\nWater and mineral metabolism \nGrowth hormone deficiency is associated with decreased plasma and extracellular volumes. Both are \nrapidly increased after treatment with somatropin. Somatropin induces the retention of sodium, \npotassium and phosphorus. \n\nBone metabolism \nSomatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone. Long-term administration of somatropin to \ngrowth hormone deficient patients with osteopenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and \ndensity at weight-bearing sites. \n\nPhysical capacity  \nMuscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with \nsomatropin. Somatropin also increases cardiac output, but the mechanism has yet to be clarified. A \ndecrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nIn clinical trials in short children/adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg/kg body weight \nper day have been used for treatment until final height is reached. In 56 patients who were \ncontinuously treated and have reached (near) final height, the mean change from height at start of \ntreatment was +1.90 SDS (0.033 mg/kg body weight per day) and +2.19 SDS (0.067 mg/kg body \nweight per day). Literature data from untreated SGA children/adolescents without early spontaneous \ncatch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS. Long-term safety data are still limited. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nThe bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80% in both healthy \nsubjects and growth hormone deficient patients.  \n\nA subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults results \nin plasma Cmax and tmax values of 72 ± 28 µg/l and 4.0 ± 2.0 hours, respectively. \n\nA subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults \nresults in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 74 ± 22 µg/l and 3.9 ± 1.2 hours, respectively. \n\nElimination \nThe mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone \ndeficient adults is about 0.4 hours. However, after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope \n5 mg/1.5 ml, Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, a half-life of 3 hours is achieved. The \n\n\n\n48 \n\nobserved difference is likely due to slow absorption from the injection site following subcutaneous \nadministration. \n\nSpecial populations \nThe absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following \nsubcutaneous administration. \n\nInformation about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations, in \ndifferent races and in patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or \nincomplete. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nIn studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance, no clinically relevant \neffects have been observed. \n\nIn other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity, local tolerance and reproduction toxicity \nno clinically relevant effects have been observed. \n\nWith somatropins, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of \nchromosome aberrations have been negative. \n\nAn increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken \nfrom patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the \nradiomimetic drug bleomycin. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. \n\nIn another study with somatropin, no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the \nlymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy. \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nInfants, children and adolescents \n- Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (growth hormone \n\ndeficiency, GHD). \n- Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome. \n- Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency. \n- Growth disturbance (current height standard deviation score (SDS) < -2.5 and parental adjusted \n\nheight SDS < -1) in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA), with a \nbirth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviation (SD), who failed to show catch-up \ngrowth (height velocity (HV) SDS < 0 during the last year) by 4 years of age or later. \n\n- Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for improvement of growth and body composition. The \ndiagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing. \n\nAdults \n- Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.  \n- Adult onset: Patients who have severe growth hormone deficiency associated with multiple \n\nhormone deficiencies as a result of known hypothalamic or pituitary pathology, and who have at \nleast one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin. These patients should \nundergo an appropriate dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone \ndeficiency. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n- Childhood onset: Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result of \ncongenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients with childhood onset GHD should \nbe re-evaluated for growth hormone secretory capacity after completion of longitudinal growth. \nIn patients with a high likelihood for persistent GHD, i.e. a congenital cause or GHD secondary \nto a hypothalamic-pituitary disease or insult, an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS < -2 \noff growth hormone treatment for at least 4 weeks should be considered sufficient evidence of \nprofound GHD. \n\nAll other patients will require IGF-I assay and one growth hormone stimulation test. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nDiagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are \nappropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth \ndisorders. \n\nPosology \n\nPaediatric population \nThe posology and administration schedule should be individualised. \n\nGrowth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone in paediatric patients \nGenerally a dose of 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7 - 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per \nday is recommended. Even higher doses have been used. \n\nWhere childhood onset GHD persists into adolescence, treatment should be continued to achieve full \nsomatic development (e.g. body composition, bone mass). For monitoring, the attainment of a normal \npeak bone mass defined as a T score > -1 (i.e. standardized to average adult peak bone mass measured \nby dual energy X-ray absorptiometry taking into account sex and ethnicity) is one of the therapeutic \nobjectives during the transition period. For guidance on dosing see adult section below. \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome, for improvement of growth and body composition in paediatric patients \nGenerally a dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day is \nrecommended. Daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded. Treatment should not be used in \npaediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses. \n\nGrowth disturbance due to Turner syndrome \nA dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day is \nrecommended. \n\nGrowth disturbance in chronic renal insufficiency \nA dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day (1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day) is \nrecommended. Higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low. A dose correction can be \nneeded after six months of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\nGrowth disturbance in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA) \nA dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day (1 mg/m2 body surface area per day) is usually \nrecommended until final height is reached (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued after \nthe first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below + 1. Treatment should be discontinued if \nheight velocity is < 2 cm/year and, if confirmation is required, bone age is > 14 years (girls) or \n> 16 years (boys), corresponding to closure of the epiphyseal growth plates. \n\n\n\n53 \n\nDose recommendations in paediatric patients \n\nIndication mg/kg body weight dose per day \nmg/m² body surface \n\narea dose per day \nGrowth hormone deficiency  0.025 - 0.035 0.7 - 1.0 \nPrader-Willi syndrome  0.035 1.0 \nTurner syndrome 0.045 - 0.050 1.4 \nChronic renal insufficiency 0.045 - 0.050 1.4 \nChildren/adolescents born small for \ngestational age (SGA) 0.035 1.0 \n\nGrowth hormone deficient adult patients \nIn patients who continue growth hormone therapy after childhood GHD, the recommended dose to \nrestart is 0.2 – 0.5 mg per day. The dose should be gradually increased or decreased according to \nindividual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I concentration.  \n\nIn adults with adult-onset GHD, therapy should start with a low dose, 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day. The dose \nshould be gradually increased according to individual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I \nconcentration. \n\nIn both cases treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) concentrations within 2 SDS \nfrom the age corrected mean. Patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment \nshould be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal, not \nexceeding the 2 SDS. Clinical response and side effects may also be used as guidance for dose \ntitration. It is recognized that there are patients with GHD who do not normalize IGF-I levels despite a \ngood clinical response, and thus do not require dose escalation. The maintenance dose rarely exceeds \n1.0 mg per day. Women may require higher doses than men, with men showing an increasing IGF-I \nsensitivity over time. This means that there is a risk that women, especially those on oral oestrogen \nreplacement are under-treated while men are over-treated. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose \nshould therefore be controlled every 6 months. As normal physiological growth hormone production \ndecreases with age, dose requirements may be reduced. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nIn patients above 60 years, therapy should start with a dose of 0.1 - 0.2 mg per day and should be \nslowly increased according to individual patient requirements. The minimum effective dose should be \nused. The maintenance dose in these patients seldom exceeds 0.5 mg per day. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n\nFor instructions for use and handling see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nSomatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours \nmust be inactive and anti-tumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH therapy. Treatment \nshould be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth. \n\nSomatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. \n\nPatients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated \nwith somatropin (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n54 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nThe maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2). \n \nIntroduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol \nconcentrations. In patients treated with somatropin, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) \nhypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required. In addition, \npatients treated with glucocorticoid replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism \nmay require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses, following initiation of somatropin \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n\nUse with oral oestrogen therapy \n\nIf a woman taking somatropin begins oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be \nincreased to maintain the serum IGF-1 levels within the normal age-appropriate range. Conversely, if \na woman on somatropin discontinues oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be \nreduced to avoid excess of growth hormone and/or side effects (see section 4.5). \n\nInsulin sensitivity \n\nSomatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose may \nrequire adjustment after somatropin therapy is instituted. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, \nor additional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy.  \n\nThyroid function \n\nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Whereas the peripheral thyroid hormone \nlevels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects, hypothyroidism theoretically \nmay develop in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. Consequently monitoring of thyroid \nfunction should therefore be conducted in all patients. In patients with hypopituitarism on standard \nreplacement therapy, the potential effect of growth hormone treatment on thyroid function must be \nclosely monitored \n\nIn growth hormone deficiency, secondary to treatment of malignant disease, it is recommended to pay \nattention to signs of relapse of the malignancy. In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a \nsecond neoplasm has been reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. \nIntracranial tumours, in particular meningiomas, in patients treated with radiation to the head for their \nfirst neoplasm, were the most common of these second neoplasms. \n\nIn patients with endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, slipped epiphyses of the \nhip may occur more frequently than in the general population. Patients limping during treatment with \nsomatropin should be examined clinically. \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension \n\nIn case of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of \ngrowth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone \ntreatment is restarted, careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n\nLeukaemia \n\nLeukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, some of \nwhom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that leukaemia incidence is \nincreased in growth hormone recipients without predisposition factors.  \n\n\n\n55 \n\nAntibodies \n\nA small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to Omnitrope. Omnitrope has given rise to the \nformation of antibodies in approximately 1% of patients. The binding capacity of these antibodies is \nlow and there is no effect on growth rate. Testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in \nany patient with otherwise unexplained lack of response.  \n\nElderly patients \nExperience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action \nof Omnitrope, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions. \n\nAcute critical illness \n\nThe effects of somatropin on recovery were studied in two placebo controlled trials involving \n522 critically ill adult patients suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure. Mortality was higher in patients \ntreated with 5.3 or 8 mg somatropin daily compared to patients receiving placebo, 42% vs. 19%. \nBased on this information, these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin. As there is no \ninformation available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill \npatients, the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential \nrisks involved. \nIn all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness, the possible benefit of treatment with \nsomatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPancreatitis  \n\nAlthough rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated children who develop \nabdominal pain. \n\nPrader-Willi syndrome \n\nIn patients with PWS, treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet. \n\nThere have been reports of fatalities associated with the use of growth hormone in paediatric patients \nwith PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity (those patients exceeding \na weight/height of 200%), history of respiratory impairment or sleep apnoea or unidentified \nrespiratory infection. Patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk. \n\nBefore initiation of treatment with somatropin patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper \nairway obstruction, sleep apnoea or respiratory infections should be assessed. \n\nIf during the evaluation of upper airway obstruction, pathological findings are observed, the child \nshould be referred to an Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for treatment and resolution of the \nrespiratory disorder prior to initiating growth hormone treatment.  \n\nSleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods \nsuch as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry, and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected. \n\nIf during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset \nof or increased snoring), treatment should be interrupted, and a new ENT assessment performed. \n\nAll patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is \nsuspected.Patients should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections, which should be diagnosed \nas early as possible and treated aggressively. \n\nAll patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during growth hormone \ntreatment. \n\n\n\n56 \n\nScoliosis is common in patients with PWS. Scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth. \nSigns of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment.  \n\nExperience with prolonged treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited. \n\nSmall for gestational age \n\nIn short children/adolescents born SGA, other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth \ndisturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment. \n\nIn SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before \nstart of treatment and annually thereafter. In patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus (e.g. \nfamilial history of diabetes, obesity, severe insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans) oral glucose \ntolerance testing (OGTT) should be performed. If overt diabetes occurs, growth hormone should not \nbe administered. \n\nIn SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment \nand twice a year thereafter. If on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed +2 SD compared to \nreferences for age and pubertal status, the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to \nconsider dose adjustment. \n\nExperience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited. It is therefore not \nrecommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty. Experience in patients with Silver-Russell \nsyndrome is limited. \n\nSome of the height gain obtained with treating short children/adolescents born SGA with growth \nhormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached. \n\nChronic renal insufficiency \n\nIn chronic renal insufficiency, renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution \nof therapy. To verify growth disturbance, growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of \ntherapy. During this period, conservative treatment for renal insufficiency (which includes control of \nacidosis, hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status) should have been established and should be \nmaintained during treatment. \n\nThe treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation. \n\nTo date, no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are \navailable. \n\nOmnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection: \nBecause of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature \nbabies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up \nto 3 years old. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nConcomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of Omnitrope. \nPatients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully \nadjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth. \n\nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nIn women on oral oestrogen replacement, a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to \nachieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n57 \n\nData from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin \nadministration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 (e.g. sex \nsteroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and ciclosporin) may be especially increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \nAlso see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for \nstatement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of somatropin in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Somatropin is not recommended \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nThere have been no clinical studies conducted with somatropin containing products in breast-feeding \nwomen. It is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk, but absorption of intact protein \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely. Therefore caution should be \nexercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women. \n\nFertility \n\nFertility studies with Omnitrope have not been performed. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nOmnitrope has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nPatients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit. When \ntreatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected. In adult patients adverse reactions \nrelated to fluid retention, such as peripheral oedema, musculoskeletal stiffness, arthralgia, myalgia and \nparaesthesia are common. In general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate, arise within the first \nmonths of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.  \n\nThe incidence of these adverse reactions is related to the administered dose, the age of patients, and \npossibly inversely related to the age of patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency. In children \nsuch adverse reactions are uncommon.  \n\nOmnitrope has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1% of the patients. The \nbinding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with \ntheir formation, see section 4.4.  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTables 1–6 show the adverse reactions ranked under headings of System Organ Class and frequency \nusing the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data) for each of the indicated conditions.  \n\n\n\n58 \n\nClinical trials in children with GHD \n\nTable 1 \n\nLong-term treatment of children with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth \nhormone \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon  \n≥ 1/10 \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to \n<1/10 \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to \n<1/100 \n\nRare \n≥ \n1/10,000 \nto \n<1/1,000 \n\nVery \nRare \n<1/10,000 \n\nNot Known \n(cannot be \nestimated from \navailable data) \n\nNeoplasms \nBenign, \nMalignant and \nUnspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps) \n\n  Leukaemia†    \n\nMetabolism and \nNutrition \nDisorders \n\n     Type 2 diabetes \nmellitus \n\nNervous System \nDisorders \n\n     Paraesthesia* \n\nBenign \nintracranial \nhypertension \n\nMusculoskeletal, \nConnective \nTissue and Bone \nDisorders \n\n  Arthralgia*   Myalgia* \n\nMusculoskeletal \nstiffness* \n\nGeneral \nDisorders and \nAdministration \nSite Conditions \n\nInjection \nsite \nreaction$ \n \n\n    Oedema \nperipheral* \n\nInvestigations      Blood cortisol \ndecreased‡ \n\n*In general, these adverse effects are mild to moderate, arise within the first months of treatment, and \nsubside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.

Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu \n\nMechanism of action \n\nSomatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates \nand proteins. In children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone, somatropin stimulates linear \ngrowth and increases growth rate. In adults as well as in children, somatropin maintains a normal body \ncomposition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth, and by \nmobilisation of body fat. Visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin. In addition \nto enhanced lipolysis, somatropin decreases the uptake of triglycerides into body fat stores. Serum \nconcentrations of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I) and IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n64 \n\nBinding Protein 3) are increased by somatropin. In addition, the following actions have been \ndemonstrated. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nLipid metabolism \nSomatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors, and affects the profile of serum lipids and \nlipoproteins. In general, administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in \nreduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B. A reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be \nobserved. \n\nCarbohydrate metabolism \nSomatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged. Children with \nhypopituitarism may experience fasting hypoglycaemia. This condition is reversed by somatropin. \n\nWater and mineral metabolism \nGrowth hormone deficiency is associated with decreased plasma and extracellular volumes. Both are \nrapidly increased after treatment with somatropin. Somatropin induces the retention of sodium, \npotassium and phosphorus. \n\nBone metabolism \nSomatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone. Long-term administration of somatropin to \ngrowth hormone deficient patients with osteopenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and \ndensity at weight-bearing sites. \n\nPhysical capacity  \nMuscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with \nsomatropin. Somatropin also increases cardiac output, but the mechanism has yet to be clarified. A \ndecrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nIn clinical trials in short children/adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg/kg body weight \nper day have been used for treatment until final height is reached. In 56 patients who were \ncontinuously treated and have reached (near) final height, the mean change from height at start of \ntreatment was +1.90 SDS (0.033 mg/kg body weight per day) and +2.19 SDS (0.067 mg/kg body \nweight per day). Literature data from untreated SGA children/adolescents without early spontaneous \ncatch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS. Long-term safety data are still limited. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nThe bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80% in both healthy \nsubjects and growth hormone deficient patients.  \n\nA subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults results \nin plasma Cmax and tmax values of 72 ± 28 µg/l and 4.0 ± 2.0 hours, respectively. \n\nA subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults \nresults in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 74 ± 22 µg/l and 3.9 ± 1.2 hours, respectively. \n\nA subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 15 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults \nresults in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 52 ± 19 µg/l and 3.7 ± 1.2 hours, respectively. \n\nElimination \nThe mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone \ndeficient adults is about 0.4 hours. However, after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope \n5 mg/1.5 ml, Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, a half-life of 3 hours is achieved. \nHowever, after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 15 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, a half-\n\n\n\n65 \n\nlife of 2.76 hours is achieved. The observed difference is likely due to slow absorption from the \ninjection site following subcutaneous administration. \n\nSpecial populations \nThe absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following \nsubcutaneous administration. \n\nInformation about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations, in \ndifferent races and in patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or \nincomplete. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nIn studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance, no clinically relevant \neffects have been observed. \n\nIn other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity, local tolerance and reproduction toxicity \nno clinically relevant effects have been observed. \n\nWith somatropins, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of \nchromosome aberrations have been negative. \n\nAn increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken \nfrom patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the \nradiomimetic drug bleomycin. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. \n\nIn another study with somatropin, no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the \nlymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy. \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n102 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\nOmnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection  \n\nSomatropin \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Omnitrope is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Omnitrope \n3. How to use Omnitrope \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Omnitrope \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n1. What Omnitrope is and what it is used for  \n\nOmnitrope is a recombinant human growth hormone (also called somatropin). It has the same structure \nas natural human growth hormone which is needed for bones and muscles to grow. It also helps your \nfat and muscle tissues to develop in the right amounts. It is recombinant meaning it is not made from \nhuman or animal tissue. \n\nIn children Omnitrope is used to treat the following growth disturbances: \n• If you are not growing properly and you do not have enough of your own growth hormone.  \n• If you have Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder in girls that can affect \n\ngrowth – your doctor will have told you if you have this. \n• If you have chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency. As kidneys lose their ability to function \n\nnormally, this can affect growth. \n• If you were small or too light at birth. Growth hormone can help you grow taller if you have not \n\nbeen able to catch up or maintain normal growth by 4 years of age or later. \n• If you have Prader-Willi syndrome (a chromosomal disorder). Growth hormone will help you \n\ngrow taller if you are still growing, and will also improve your body composition. Your \nexcessive fat will decrease and your reduced muscle mass will improve. \n\nIn adults Omnitrope is used to \n• treat persons with pronounced growth hormone deficiency. This can start during either adult life \n\nor it can continue from childhood. \nIf you have been treated with Omnitrope for growth hormone deficiency during childhood, your \ngrowth hormone status will be retested after completion of growth. If severe growth hormone \ndeficiency is confirmed, your doctor will propose continuation of Omnitrope treatment. \n\nYou should only be given this medicine by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone \ntreatment and who has confirmed your diagnosis. \n\n\n\n103 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Omnitrope \n\nDo not use Omnitrope \n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of \n\nOmnitrope. \n• and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour (cancer). Tumours must be inactive and you \n\nmust have finished your anti-tumour treatment before you start your treatment with Omnitrope. \n• and tell your doctor if Omnitrope has been prescribed to stimulate growth but you have already \n\nstopped growing (closed epiphyses). \n• if you are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \n\nsurgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). If you are about to \nhave, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and \nremind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth hormone. \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Omnitrope. \n• If you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids, you should consult your doctor \n\nregularly, as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. \n• If you are at risk of developing diabetes, your doctor will need to monitor your blood sugar \n\nlevel during therapy with somatropin. \n• If you have diabetes, you should closely monitor your blood sugar level during treatment with \n\nsomatropin and discuss the results with your doctor to determine whether you need to change \nthe dose of your medicines to treat diabetes. \n\n• After starting somatropin treatment some patients may need to start thyroid hormone \nreplacement. \n\n• If you are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones it may become necessary to adjust your \nthyroid hormone dose. \n\n• If you have raised intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, \nvisual disturbances or vomiting) you should inform your doctor about it. \n\n• If you walk with a limp or if you start to limp during your growth hormone treatment, you \nshould inform your doctor. \n\n• If you are receiving somatropin for growth hormone deficiency following a previous tumour \n(cancer), you should be examined regularly for recurrence of the tumour or any other cancer. \n\n• If you experience worsening abdominal pain you should inform your doctor. \n• Experience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly persons may be more sensitive to the \n\naction of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop side effects. \n\nChildren with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency  \n• Your doctor should examine your kidney function and your growth rate before starting \n\nsomatropin. Medical treatment for your kidney should be continued. Somatropin treatment \nshould be stopped at kidney transplantation. \n\nChildren with Prader-Willi syndrome  \n• Your doctor will give you diet restrictions to follow to control your weight. \n• Your doctor will assess you for signs of upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea (where your \n\nbreathing is interrupted during sleep), or respiratory infection before you start treatment with \nsomatropin. \n\n• During treatment with somatropin, tell your doctor if you show signs of upper airway \nobstruction (including starting to snore or worsening of snoring), your doctor will need to \nexamine you and may interrupt treatment with somatropin. \n\n• During treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of scoliosis, a type of spinal deformity. \n• During treatment, if you develop a lung infection, tell your doctor so that he can treat the \n\ninfection. \n\n\n\n104 \n\nChildren born small or too light at birth \n• If you were too small or too light at birth and are aged between 9 and 12 years, ask your doctor \n\nfor specific advice relating to puberty and treatment with this medicine. \n• Treatment should be continued until you have stopped growing. \n• Your doctor will check your blood sugar and insulin levels before the start of treatment and \n\nevery year during treatment. \n\nOther medicines and Omnitrope \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\nIn particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Omnitrope or of the other medicines: \n\n• medicine to treat diabetes,  \n• thyroid hormones, \n• medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants),  \n• ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune system after transplantation), \n• oestrogen taken orally or other sex hormones,  \n• synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids).  \nYour doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of somatropin. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou should not use Omnitrope if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Omnitrope \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’. \n\n3. How to use Omnitrope \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nThe dose depends on your size, the condition for which you are being treated and how well growth \nhormone works for you. Everyone is different. Your doctor will advise you about your individualised \ndose of Omnitrope in milligrams (mg) from either your body weight in kilograms (kg) or your body \nsurface area calculated from your height and weight in square metres (m2), as well as your treatment \nschedule. Do not change the dosage and treatment schedule without consulting your doctor.  \n\nThe recommended dose is for:  \n\nChildren with growth hormone deficiency:  \n0.025–0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7–1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. Higher doses \ncan be used. When growth hormone deficiency continues into adolescence, Omnitrope should be \ncontinued until completion of physical development.  \n\nChildren with Turner syndrome:  \n0.045–0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day.  \n\nChildren with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency:  \n0.045–0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day. Higher doses may be \nnecessary if the rate of growth is too low. Dosage adjustment may be necessary after 6 months of \ntreatment.  \n\n\n\n105 \n\nChildren with Prader-Willi syndrome:  \n0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. The daily dosage should \nnot exceed 2.7 mg. Treatment should not be used in children who have almost stopped growing after \npuberty.  \n\nChildren born smaller or lighter than expected and with growth disturbance:  \n0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. It is important to continue \ntreatment until final height is reached. Treatment should be discontinued after the first year if you are \nnot responding or if you have reached your final height and stopped growing.  \n\nAdults with growth hormone deficiency:  \nIf you continue Omnitrope after treatment during childhood you should start with 0.2–0.5 mg per day. \nThis dosage should be gradually increased or decreased according to blood test results as well as \nclinical response and side effects. \n\nIf your growth hormone deficiency starts during adult life you should start with 0.15–0.3 mg per day. \nThis dosage should be gradually increased according to blood test results as well as clinical response \nand side effects. The daily maintenance dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg per day. Women may require \nhigher doses than men. Dosage should be monitored every 6 months. Persons above 60 years should \nstart with a dose of 0.1–0.2 mg per day which should be slowly increased according to individual \nrequirements. The minimum effective dose should be used. The maintenance dose seldom exceeds 0.5 \nmg per day. Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor. \n\nInjecting Omnitrope \n\nInject your growth hormone at about the same time every day. Bedtime is a good time because it is \neasy to remember. It is also natural to have a higher level of growth hormone at night. \n\nOmnitrope is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short injection \nneedle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. Most people do their injections into their thigh or their \nbottom. Do your injection in the place you have been shown by your doctor. Fatty tissue of the skin \ncan shrink at the site of injection. To avoid this, use a slightly different place for your injection each \ntime. This gives your skin and the area under your skin time to recover from one injection before it \ngets another one in the same place. \n\nYour doctor should have already shown you how to use Omnitrope. Always inject Omnitrope exactly \nas your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\nHow to inject Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml \n\nThe following instructions explain how to inject Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml yourself. Please read the \ninstructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor will show you how to inject \nOmnitrope. Do not attempt to inject unless you are sure you understand the procedure and \nrequirements for the injection. \n\n- After reconstitution, Omnitrope is given as an injection under the skin.  \n- Carefully inspect the solution before injecting it and use only if clear and colourless. \n- Change the injection sites to minimise the risk of local lipoatrophy (local reduction of fatty \n\ntissue under the skin). \n \nPreparation  \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n\n \n\n- a vial with Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder for solution for injection. \n- a vial with solvent (liquid) for Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml. \n- a sterile, disposable syringe (e.g. 2 ml syringe) and needle (e.g. \n\n0.33 mm x 12.7 mm) for withdrawing the solvent from the vial (not \nsupplied in the pack). \n\n- a sterile, disposable syringe of appropriate size (e.g. 1 ml syringe)  \n\n\n\n106 \n\nand injection needle (e.g. 0.25 mm x 8 mm) for subcutaneous \ninjection (not supplied in the pack). \n\n- 2 cleansing swabs (not supplied in the pack).  \n  \nWash your hands before you continue with the next steps.  \n  \nReconstituting Omnitrope  \n- Remove the protective caps from the two vials in the box. With a \n\ncleansing swab, disinfect the rubber membranes of both the \npowder-filled and the solvent-filled vial. \n\n \n- Take the vial with solvent and the sterile, disposable syringe (e.g. \n\n2 ml syringe) and needle (e.g. 0.33 mm x 12.7 mm). Push the \nneedle fitted to the syringe through the rubber membrane. \n\n \n- Turn the vial with the solvent upside down and withdraw all the \n\nsolvent from the vial. \n\n \n- Take the vial with the powder and push the needle through the \n\nrubber membrane of the vial. Inject the solvent slowly. Aim the \nstream of liquid against the glass wall in order to avoid foam. \nRemove the syringe and needle.  \n\n- Gently swirl the reconstituted vial until the content is completely \ndissolved. Do not shake. \n\n \n- If the solution is cloudy (and the cloudiness does not disappear \n\nwithin ten minutes) or contains particles, it should not be used. The \ncontents must be clear and colourless.  \n\n \n\n \n\n- Use the solution immediately.  \n  \nMeasuring the dose of Omnitrope to be injected  \n- Take the sterile, disposable syringe of appropriate size (e.g. 1 ml \n\nsyringe) and injection needle (e.g. 0.25 mm x 8 mm). \n \n\n- Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial with the \nreconstituted solution. \n\n \n\n- Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. \n\n \n- Be sure that the tip of the syringe is in the Omnitrope reconstituted \n\nsolution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. \n \n\n- Pull back on the plunger slowly and withdraw just a bit more than \nthe dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \n\n \n\n- Hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up and remove \nthe syringe from the vial. \n\n \n\n- Check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull \nthe plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle \npointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger \nslowly back to the correct dose. \n\n \n\n- Inspect the reconstituted solution visually prior to administration.  \nDo not use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles. You \nare now ready to inject the dose.  \n\n \n\n  \nInjecting Omnitrope  \n- Select the site of injection. The best sites for injection are tissues \n\nwith a layer of fat between skin and muscle, such as the thigh or \n \n\n\n\n107 \n\nbelly (except the navel or waistline). \n- Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and \n\nthat you change the places where you inject, as you have been \ntaught. \n\n \n\n- Before you make an injection, clean your skin well with an alcohol \nswab. Wait for the area to dry. \n\n \n- With one hand, pitch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand, \n\nhold the syringe as you would a pencil. Insert the needle into the \npinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. After the needle is in, \nremove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the \nsyringe barrel. Pull back the plunger very slightly with one hand. If \nblood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. \nDo not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat this step. \nInject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently. \n\n \n\n- Pull the needle straight out of the skin.   \n  \nAfter injecting  \n- After injection, press the injection site with a small bandage or \n\nsterile gauze for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. \n \n\n- The residual solution, vials, and injection materials intended for \nsingle use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringes safely in a \nclosed container. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Omnitrope than you should \n\nIf you inject much more than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Your \nblood sugar level could fall too low and later rise too high. You might feel shaky, sweaty, sleepy or \n“not yourself”, and you might faint. \n\nIf you forget to use Omnitrope \n\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. It is best to use your growth hormone \nregularly. If you forget to use a dose, have your next injection at the usual time the next day. Keep a \nnote of any missed injections and tell your doctor at your next check-up. \n\nIf you stop using Omnitrope \n\nAsk for advice from your doctor before you stop using Omnitrope. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The very \ncommon and common side effects in adults may start within the first months of treatment and may \neither stop spontaneously or if your dose is reduced. \n\nVery common side effects (likely to occur in more than 1 in 10 patients) include: \n\nIn adults \n• Joint pain \n• Water retention (which shows as puffy fingers or swollen ankles) \n\nCommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Temporary reddening, itchiness or pain at the injection site \n\n\n\n108 \n\n• Joint pain \n\nIn adults \n• Numbness/tingling \n• Stiffness in the arms and legs, muscle pain \n• Pain or burning sensation in the hands or underarms (known as Carpal Tunnel syndrome) \n\nUncommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 100 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Water retention (which shows as puffy fingers or swollen ankles, for a short time at the start of \n\ntreatment) \n\nRare side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 1,000 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Numbness/tingling \n• Leukaemia (This has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, \n\nsome of whom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that \nleukaemia incidence is increased in growth hormone recipients without predisposing factors.) \n\n• Increased intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, visual \ndisturbances or vomiting) \n\n• Muscle pain \n\nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n\n• Type 2 diabetes \n• A decrease in the levels of the hormone Cortisol in your blood \n\nIn children \n• Stiffness in the arms and legs \n\nIn adults \n• Increased intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms such as strong headache, visual \n\ndisturbances or vomiting) \n• Reddening, itchiness or pain at the injection site \n\nFormation of antibodies to the injected growth hormone but these do not seem to stop the growth \nhormone from working. \n\nThe skin around the injection area can get uneven or lumpy, but this should not happen if you inject in \na different place each time. \n\nThere have been rare cases of sudden death in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. However, no link \nhas been made between these cases and treatment with Omnitrope. \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease may be considered by your doctor if \ndiscomfort or pain in the hip or knee is experienced whilst being treated with Omnitrope. \n\nOther possible side effects related to your treatment with growth hormone may include the following: \n\nYou (or your child) may experience a high blood sugar or reduced levels of thyroid hormone. This can \nbe tested by your doctor and if necessary your doctor will prescribe the adequate treatment. Rarely, an \ninflammation of the pancreas has been reported in patients treated with growth hormone. \n\nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n109 \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n\n5.

What Omnitrope is and what it is used for  \n\nOmnitrope is a recombinant human growth hormone (also called somatropin). It has the same structure \nas natural human growth hormone which is needed for bones and muscles to grow. It also helps your \nfat and muscle tissues to develop in the right amounts. It is recombinant meaning it is not made from \nhuman or animal tissue. \n\nIn children Omnitrope is used to treat the following growth disturbances: \n• If you are not growing properly and you do not have enough of your own growth hormone.  \n• If you have Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder in girls that can affect \n\ngrowth – your doctor will have told you if you have this. \n• If you have chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency. As kidneys lose their ability to function \n\nnormally, this can affect growth. \n• If you were small or too light at birth. Growth hormone can help you grow taller if you have not \n\nbeen able to catch up or maintain normal growth by 4 years of age or later. \n• If you have Prader-Willi syndrome (a chromosomal disorder). Growth hormone will help you \n\ngrow taller if you are still growing, and will also improve your body composition. Your \nexcessive fat will decrease and your reduced muscle mass will improve. \n\nIn adults Omnitrope is used to \n• treat persons with pronounced growth hormone deficiency. This can start during either adult life \n\nor it can continue from childhood. \nIf you have been treated with Omnitrope for growth hormone deficiency during childhood, your \ngrowth hormone status will be retested after completion of growth. If severe growth hormone \ndeficiency is confirmed, your doctor will propose continuation of Omnitrope treatment. \n\nYou should only be given this medicine by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone \ntreatment and who has confirmed your diagnosis. \n\n\n\n112 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Omnitrope \n\nDo not use Omnitrope \n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of \n\nOmnitrope. \n• and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour (cancer). Tumours must be inactive and you \n\nmust have finished your anti-tumour treatment before you start your treatment with Omnitrope. \n• and tell your doctor if Omnitrope has been prescribed to stimulate growth but you have already \n\nstopped growing (closed epiphyses). \n• if you are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \n\nsurgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). If you are about to \nhave, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and \nremind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth hormone. \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Omnitrope. \n• If you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids, you should consult your doctor \n\nregularly, as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. \n• If you are at risk of developing diabetes, your doctor will need to monitor your blood sugar \n\nlevel during therapy with somatropin. \n• If you have diabetes, you should closely monitor your blood sugar level during treatment with \n\nsomatropin and discuss the results with your doctor to determine whether you need to change \nthe dose of your medicines to treat diabetes. \n\n• After starting somatropin treatment some patients may need to start thyroid hormone \nreplacement. \n\n• If you are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones it may become necessary to adjust your \nthyroid hormone dose. \n\n• If you have raised intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, \nvisual disturbances or vomiting) you should inform your doctor about it. \n\n• If you walk with a limp or if you start to limp during your growth hormone treatment, you \nshould inform your doctor. \n\n• If you are receiving somatropin for growth hormone deficiency following a previous tumour \n(cancer), you should be examined regularly for recurrence of the tumour or any other cancer. \n\n• If you experience worsening abdominal pain you should inform your doctor. \n• Experience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly persons may be more sensitive to the \n\naction of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop side effects. \n\nChildren with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency  \n• Your doctor should examine your kidney function and your growth rate before starting \n\nsomatropin. Medical treatment for your kidney should be continued. Somatropin treatment \nshould be stopped at kidney transplantation. \n\nChildren with Prader-Willi syndrome  \n• Your doctor will give you diet restrictions to follow to control your weight. \n• Your doctor will assess you for signs of upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea (where your \n\nbreathing is interrupted during sleep), or respiratory infection before you start treatment with \nsomatropin. \n\n• During treatment with somatropin, tell your doctor if you show signs of upper airway \nobstruction (including starting to snore or worsening of snoring), your doctor will need to \nexamine you and may interrupt treatment with somatropin. \n\n• During treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of scoliosis, a type of spinal deformity. \n• During treatment, if you develop a lung infection, tell your doctor so that he can treat the \n\ninfection. \n\n\n\n113 \n\nChildren born small or too light at birth \n• If you were too small or too light at birth and are aged between 9 and 12 years, ask your doctor \n\nfor specific advice relating to puberty and treatment with this medicine. \n• Treatment should be continued until you have stopped growing. \n• Your doctor will check your blood sugar and insulin levels before the start of treatment and \n\nevery year during treatment. \n\nOther medicines and Omnitrope \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\nIn particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Omnitrope or of the other medicines: \n\n• medicine to treat diabetes,  \n• thyroid hormones, \n• medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants),  \n• ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune system after transplantation), \n• oestrogen taken orally or other sex hormones,  \n• synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids).  \nYour doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of somatropin. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou should not use Omnitrope if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Omnitrope \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’. \n\nAfter reconstitution, one ml contains 15 mg benzyl alcohol. \n\nBecause of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature \nbabies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and allergic reactions in infants and children up to \n3 years old. \n\n3. How to use Omnitrope \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nThe dose depends on your size, the condition for which you are being treated and how well growth \nhormone works for you. Everyone is different. Your doctor will advise you about your individualised \ndose of Omnitrope in milligrams (mg) from either your body weight in kilograms (kg) or your body \nsurface area calculated from your height and weight in square metres (m2), as well as your treatment \nschedule. Do not change the dosage and treatment schedule without consulting your doctor.  \n\nThe recommended dose is for:  \n\nChildren with growth hormone deficiency:  \n0.025–0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7–1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. Higher doses \ncan be used. When growth hormone deficiency continues into adolescence, Omnitrope should be \ncontinued until completion of physical development.  \n\nChildren with Turner syndrome:  \n0.045–0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day.  \n\n\n\n114 \n\nChildren with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency:  \n0.045–0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day. Higher doses may be \nnecessary if the rate of growth is too low. Dosage adjustment may be necessary after 6 months of \ntreatment.  \n\nChildren with Prader-Willi syndrome:  \n0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. The daily dosage should \nnot exceed 2.7 mg. Treatment should not be used in children who have almost stopped growing after \npuberty.  \n\nChildren born smaller or lighter than expected and with growth disturbance:  \n0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. It is important to continue \ntreatment until final height is reached. Treatment should be discontinued after the first year if you are \nnot responding or if you have reached your final height and stopped growing.  \n\nAdults with growth hormone deficiency:  \nIf you continue Omnitrope after treatment during childhood you should start with 0.2–0.5 mg per day. \nThis dosage should be gradually increased or decreased according to blood test results as well as \nclinical response and side effects. \n\nIf your growth hormone deficiency starts during adult life you should start with 0.15–0.3 mg per day. \nThis dosage should be gradually increased according to blood test results as well as clinical response \nand side effects. The daily maintenance dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg per day. Women may require \nhigher doses than men. Dosage should be monitored every 6 months. Persons above 60 years should \nstart with a dose of 0.1–0.2 mg per day which should be slowly increased according to individual \nrequirements. The minimum effective dose should be used. The maintenance dose seldom exceeds 0.5 \nmg per day. Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor. \n\nInjecting Omnitrope \n\nInject your growth hormone at about the same time every day. Bedtime is a good time because it is \neasy to remember. It is also natural to have a higher level of growth hormone at night. \n\nOmnitrope 5 mg/ml is intended for multiple use. It should only be administered with the Omnitrope \nPen L, an injection device specifically developed for use with Omnitrope 5 mg/ml powder and solvent \nfor solution for injection. \n\nOmnitrope is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short injection \nneedle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. Most people do their injections into their thigh or their \nbottom. Do your injection in the place you have been shown by your doctor. Fatty tissue of the skin \ncan shrink at the site of injection. To avoid this, use a slightly different place for your injection each \ntime. This gives your skin and the area under your skin time to recover from one injection before it \ngets another one in the same place. \n\nYour doctor should have already shown you how to use Omnitrope. Always inject Omnitrope exactly \nas your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\nHow to inject Omnitrope 5 mg/ml \n\nThe following instructions explain how to inject Omnitrope 5 mg/ml yourself. Please read the \ninstructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor will show you how to inject \nOmnitrope. Do not attempt to inject unless you are sure you understand the procedure and \nrequirements for the injection. \n\n- After reconstitution, Omnitrope is given as an injection under the skin.  \n- Carefully inspect the solution before injecting it and use only if clear and colourless. \n- Change the injection sites to minimise the risk of local lipoatrophy (local reduction of fatty \n\ntissue under the skin). \n \n\n\n\n115 \n\nPreparation  \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n\n \n\n- a vial with Omnitrope 5 mg/ml powder for solution for injection. \n- a cartridge with solvent for Omnitrope 5 mg/ml. \n- a transfer set for mixing and transferring the reconstituted solution \n\nback into the cartridge (see Instructions for Use of the pen injector). \n- the Omnitrope Pen L, an injection device specifically developed for \n\nuse with Omnitrope 5 mg/ml reconstituted solution for injection \n(not supplied in the pack; see Instructions for Use of the transfer set \nand of the injection device). \n\n \n\n- a pen needle for subcutaneous injection.  \n- 2 cleansing swabs (not supplied in the pack).  \n  \nWash your hands before you continue with the next steps.  \n  \nReconstituting Omnitrope  \n- Remove the protective cap from the vial. With a cleansing swab, \n\ndisinfect both the rubber membrane of the vial with powder and the \nrubber membrane of the cartridge with solvent. \n\n \n- Use the transfer set for transferring all the solvent from the \n\ncartridge into the vial. Follow the instructions that come with the \ntransfer set. \n\n \n\n- Gently swirl the reconstituted vial until the content is completely \ndissolved. Do not shake \n\n \n\n- If the solution is cloudy (and the cloudiness does not disappear \nwithin ten minutes) or contains particles, it should not be used. The \ncontents must be clear and colourless.  \n\n \n\n- Transfer all of the dissolved solution back into the cartridge using \nthe transfer set. \n\n \n\n  \nInjecting Omnitrope  \n- Put the cartridge with the dissolved Omnitrope into the pen for \n\ninjection. Follow the Instructions for Use of the pen injector. To \nsetup the pen dial the dose. \n\n \n\n- Eliminate any air bubbles.  \n- Select the site of injection. The best sites for injection are tissues \n\nwith a layer of fat between skin and muscle, such as the thigh or \nbelly (except the navel or waistline). \n\n \n\n- Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and \nthat you change the places where you inject, as you have been \ntaught. \n\n \n\n- Before you make an injection, clean your skin well with an alcohol \nswab. Wait for the area to dry. \n\n \n- Insert the needle into the skin in the way your doctor has taught \n\nyou.  \n \n\n  \nAfter injecting  \n- After injection, press the injection site with a small bandage or \n\nsterile gauze for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. \n \n\n- Take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap, and discard \nthe needle. This will keep the Omnitrope solution sterile and \nprevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the pen and the \nneedle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your \npen. \n\n \n\n- Leave the cartridge in the pen, put the cap on the pen, and store it in  \n\n\n\n116 \n\nthe refrigerator. \n- The solution should be clear after removal from the refrigerator. Do \n\nnot use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles.  \n \n\nIf you use more Omnitrope than you should \n\nIf you inject much more than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Your \nblood sugar level could fall too low and later rise too high. You might feel shaky, sweaty, sleepy or \n“not yourself”, and you might faint. \n\nIf you forget to use Omnitrope \n\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. It is best to use your growth hormone \nregularly. If you forget to use a dose, have your next injection at the usual time the next day. Keep a \nnote of any missed injections and tell your doctor at your next check-up. \n\nIf you stop using Omnitrope \n\nAsk for advice from your doctor before you stop using Omnitrope. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The very \ncommon and common side effects in adults may start within the first months of treatment and may \neither stop spontaneously or if your dose is reduced. \n\nVery common side effects (likely to occur in more than 1 in 10 patients) include: \n\nIn adults \n• Joint pain \n• Water retention (which shows as puffy fingers or swollen ankles) \n\nCommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Temporary reddening, itchiness or pain at the injection site \n• Joint pain \n\nIn adults \n• Numbness/tingling \n• Stiffness in the arms and legs, muscle pain \n• Pain or burning sensation in the hands or underarms (known as Carpal Tunnel syndrome) \n\nUncommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 100 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Water retention (which shows as puffy fingers or swollen ankles, for a short time at the start of \n\ntreatment) \n\nRare side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 1,000 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Numbness/tingling \n• Leukaemia (This has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, \n\nsome of whom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that \nleukaemia incidence is increased in growth hormone recipients without predisposing factors.) \n\n\n\n117 \n\n• Increased intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, visual \ndisturbances or vomiting) \n\n• Muscle pain \n\nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n\n• Type 2 diabetes \n• A decrease in the levels of the hormone Cortisol in your blood \n\nIn children \n• Stiffness in the arms and legs \n\nIn adults \n• Increased intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms such as strong headache, visual \n\ndisturbances or vomiting) \n• Reddening, itchiness or pain at the injection site \n\nFormation of antibodies to the injected growth hormone but these do not seem to stop the growth \nhormone from working. \n\nThe skin around the injection area can get uneven or lumpy, but this should not happen if you inject in \na different place each time. \n\nThere have been rare cases of sudden death in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. However, no link \nhas been made between these cases and treatment with Omnitrope. \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease may be considered by your doctor if \ndiscomfort or pain in the hip or knee is experienced whilst being treated with Omnitrope. \n\nOther possible side effects related to your treatment with growth hormone may include the following: \n\nYou (or your child) may experience a high blood sugar or reduced levels of thyroid hormone. This can \nbe tested by your doctor and if necessary your doctor will prescribe the adequate treatment. Rarely, an \ninflammation of the pancreas has been reported in patients treated with growth hormone. \n\nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n\n5.

Somatropin treatment \nshould be stopped at kidney transplantation. \n\nChildren with Prader-Willi syndrome  \n• Your doctor will give you diet restrictions to follow to control your weight. \n• Your doctor will assess you for signs of upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea (where your \n\nbreathing is interrupted during sleep), or respiratory infection before you start treatment with \nsomatropin. \n\n• During treatment with somatropin, tell your doctor if you show signs of upper airway \nobstruction (including starting to snore or worsening of snoring), your doctor will need to \nexamine you and may interrupt treatment with somatropin. \n\n• During treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of scoliosis, a type of spinal deformity. \n• During treatment, if you develop a lung infection, tell your doctor so that he can treat the \n\ninfection. \n\n\n\n121 \n\nChildren born small or too light at birth \n• If you were too small or too light at birth and are aged between 9 and 12 years, ask your doctor \n\nfor specific advice relating to puberty and treatment with this medicine. \n• Treatment should be continued until you have stopped growing. \n• Your doctor will check your blood sugar and insulin levels before the start of treatment and \n\nevery year during treatment. \n\nOther medicines and Omnitrope \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\nIn particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Omnitrope or of the other medicines: \n\n• medicine to treat diabetes,  \n• thyroid hormones, \n• medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants),  \n• ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune system after transplantation), \n• oestrogen taken orally or other sex hormones,  \n• synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids).  \nYour doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of somatropin. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou should not use Omnitrope if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Omnitrope \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’. \n\nOmnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection: \nOne ml contains 9 mg benzyl alcohol. \n\nBecause of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature \nbabies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and allergic reactions in infants and children up to \n3 years old. \n\n3. How to use Omnitrope \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nThe dose depends on your size, the condition for which you are being treated and how well growth \nhormone works for you. Everyone is different. Your doctor will advise you about your individualised \ndose of Omnitrope in milligrams (mg) from either your body weight in kilograms (kg) or your body \nsurface area calculated from your height and weight in square metres (m2), as well as your treatment \nschedule. Do not change the dosage and treatment schedule without consulting your doctor.  \n\nThe recommended dose is for:  \n\nChildren with growth hormone deficiency:  \n0.025–0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7–1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. Higher doses \ncan be used. When growth hormone deficiency continues into adolescence, Omnitrope should be \ncontinued until completion of physical development.  \n\n\n\n122 \n\nChildren with Turner syndrome:  \n0.045–0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day.  \n\nChildren with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency:  \n0.045–0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day. Higher doses may be \nnecessary if the rate of growth is too low. Dosage adjustment may be necessary after 6 months of \ntreatment.  \n\nChildren with Prader-Willi syndrome:  \n0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. The daily dosage should \nnot exceed 2.7 mg. Treatment should not be used in children who have almost stopped growing after \npuberty.  \n\nChildren born smaller or lighter than expected and with growth disturbance:  \n0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. It is important to continue \ntreatment until final height is reached. Treatment should be discontinued after the first year if you are \nnot responding or if you have reached your final height and stopped growing.  \n\nAdults with growth hormone deficiency:  \nIf you continue Omnitrope after treatment during childhood you should start with 0.2–0.5 mg per day. \nThis dosage should be gradually increased or decreased according to blood test results as well as \nclinical response and side effects. \n\nIf your growth hormone deficiency starts during adult life you should start with 0.15–0.3 mg per day. \nThis dosage should be gradually increased according to blood test results as well as clinical response \nand side effects. The daily maintenance dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg per day. Women may require \nhigher doses than men. Dosage should be monitored every 6 months. Persons above 60 years should \nstart with a dose of 0.1–0.2 mg per day which should be slowly increased according to individual \nrequirements. The minimum effective dose should be used. The maintenance dose seldom exceeds 0.5 \nmg per day. Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor. \n\nInjecting Omnitrope \n\nInject your growth hormone at about the same time every day. Bedtime is a good time because it is \neasy to remember. It is also natural to have a higher level of growth hormone at night. \n\nOmnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml is intended for multiple use. It should only be administered with the \nOmnitrope Pen 5, an injection device specifically developed for use with Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml \nsolution for injection. \n\nOmnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml is intended for multiple use. It should only be administered with the \nOmnitrope Pen 10, an injection device specifically developed for use with Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml \nsolution for injection. \n\nOmnitrope is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short injection \nneedle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. Most people do their injections into their thigh or their \nbottom. Do your injection in the place you have been shown by your doctor. Fatty tissue of the skin \ncan shrink at the site of injection. To avoid this, use a slightly different place for your injection each \ntime. This gives your skin and the area under your skin time to recover from one injection before it \ngets another one in the same place. \n\nYour doctor should have already shown you how to use Omnitrope. Always inject Omnitrope exactly \nas your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\nHow to inject Omnitrope  \n\nThe following instructions explain how to inject Omnitrope yourself. Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor will show you how to inject Omnitrope. Do not \nattempt to inject unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements for the injection. \n\n\n\n123 \n\n- Omnitrope is given as an injection under the skin.  \n- Carefully inspect the solution before injecting it and use only if clear and colourless. \n- Change the injection sites to minimise the risk of local lipoatrophy (local reduction of fatty \n\ntissue under the skin). \n \nPreparation  \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n\n \n\n- a cartridge with Omnitrope solution for injection. \n\n- the Omnitrope Pen , an injection device specifically developed for \nuse with Omnitrope  solution for injection (not supplied in the \npack; see Instructions for Use provided with the Omnitrope Pen). \n\n- a pen needle for subcutaneous injection.  \n- 2 cleansing swabs (not supplied in the pack).  \n  \nWash your hands before you continue with the next steps.  \n  \nInjecting Omnitrope  \n- With a cleansing swab, disinfect the rubber membrane of the \n\ncartridge. \n- The contents must be clear and colourless.  \n\n \n\n- Insert the cartridge into the pen for injection. Follow the \nInstructions for Use of the pen injector. To setup the pen dial the \ndose. \n\n \n\n- Select the site of injection. The best sites for injection are tissues \nwith a layer of fat between skin and muscle, such as the thigh or \nbelly (except the navel or waistline). \n\n \n\n- Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and \nthat you change the places where you inject, as you have been \ntaught. \n\n \n\n- Before you make an injection, clean your skin well with an alcohol \nswab. Wait for the area to dry. \n\n \n- Insert the needle into the skin in the way your doctor has taught \n\nyou.  \n \n\n  \nAfter injecting  \n- After injection, press the injection site with a small bandage or \n\nsterile gauze for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. \n \n\n- Take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap, and discard \nthe needle. This will keep the Omnitrope solution sterile and \nprevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the pen and the \nneedle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your \npen. \n\n \n\n- Leave the cartridge in the pen, put the cap on the pen, and store it in \nthe refrigerator. \n\n \n\n- The solution should be clear after removal from the refrigerator. Do \nnot use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more Omnitrope than you should \n\nIf you inject much more than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Your \nblood sugar level could fall too low and later rise too high. You might feel shaky, sweaty, sleepy or \n“not yourself”, and you might faint. \n\n\n\n124 \n\nIf you forget to use Omnitrope \n\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. It is best to use your growth hormone \nregularly. If you forget to use a dose, have your next injection at the usual time the next day. Keep a \nnote of any missed injections and tell your doctor at your next check-up. \n\nIf you stop using Omnitrope \n\nAsk for advice from your doctor before you stop using Omnitrope. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The very \ncommon and common side effects in adults may start within the first months of treatment and may \neither stop spontaneously or if your dose is reduced. \n\nVery common side effects (likely to occur in more than 1 in 10 patients) include: \n\nIn adults \n• Joint pain \n• Water retention (which shows as puffy fingers or swollen ankles) \n\nCommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Temporary reddening, itchiness or pain at the injection site \n• Joint pain \n\nIn adults \n• Numbness/tingling \n• Stiffness in the arms and legs, muscle pain \n• Pain or burning sensation in the hands or underarms (known as Carpal Tunnel syndrome) \n\nUncommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 100 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Water retention (which shows as puffy fingers or swollen ankles, for a short time at the start of \n\ntreatment) \n\nRare side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 1,000 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Numbness/tingling \n• Leukaemia (This has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, \n\nsome of whom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that \nleukaemia incidence is increased in growth hormone recipients without predisposing factors.) \n\n• Increased intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, visual \ndisturbances or vomiting) \n\n• Muscle pain \n\nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n\n• Type 2 diabetes \n• A decrease in the levels of the hormone Cortisol in your blood \n\nIn children \n• Stiffness in the arms and legs \n\n\n\n125 \n\nIn adults \n• Increased intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms such as strong headache, visual \n\ndisturbances or vomiting) \n• Reddening, itchiness or pain at the injection site \n\nFormation of antibodies to the injected growth hormone but these do not seem to stop the growth \nhormone from working. \n\nThe skin around the injection area can get uneven or lumpy, but this should not happen if you inject in \na different place each time. \n\nThere have been rare cases of sudden death in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. However, no link \nhas been made between these cases and treatment with Omnitrope. \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease may be considered by your doctor if \ndiscomfort or pain in the hip or knee is experienced whilst being treated with Omnitrope. \n\nOther possible side effects related to your treatment with growth hormone may include the following: \nYou (or your child) may experience a high blood sugar or reduced levels of thyroid hormone. This can \nbe tested by your doctor and if necessary your doctor will prescribe the adequate treatment. Rarely, an \ninflammation of the pancreas has been reported in patients treated with growth hormone. \n\nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n\n5. How to store Omnitrope \n\nKeep out of the sight and reach of children. \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n• Store and transport refrigerated (2°C–8°C). \n• Do not freeze. \n• Store in the original package in order to protect from light. \n• After the first injection, the cartridge should remain in the pen injector and has to be stored in a \n\nrefrigerator (2°C–8°C) and only used for a maximum of 28 days.  \nDo not use Omnitrope if you notice that the solution is cloudy.  \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

What Omnitrope is and what it is used for  \n\nOmnitrope is a recombinant human growth hormone (also called somatropin). It has the same structure \nas natural human growth hormone which is needed for bones and muscles to grow. It also helps your \nfat and muscle tissues to develop in the right amounts. It is recombinant meaning it is not made from \nhuman or animal tissue. \n\nIn children Omnitrope is used to treat the following growth disturbances: \n• If you are not growing properly and you do not have enough of your own growth hormone.  \n• If you have Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder in girls that can affect \n\ngrowth – your doctor will have told you if you have this. \n• If you have chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency. As kidneys lose their ability to function \n\nnormally, this can affect growth. \n• If you were small or too light at birth. Growth hormone can help you grow taller if you have not \n\nbeen able to catch up or maintain normal growth by 4 years of age or later. \n• If you have Prader-Willi syndrome (a chromosomal disorder). Growth hormone will help you \n\ngrow taller if you are still growing, and will also improve your body composition. Your \nexcessive fat will decrease and your reduced muscle mass will improve. \n\nIn adults Omnitrope is used to \n• treat persons with pronounced growth hormone deficiency. This can start during either adult life \n\nor it can continue from childhood. \nIf you have been treated with Omnitrope for growth hormone deficiency during childhood, your \ngrowth hormone status will be retested after completion of growth. If severe growth hormone \ndeficiency is confirmed, your doctor will propose continuation of Omnitrope treatment. \n\nYou should only be given this medicine by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone \ntreatment and who has confirmed your diagnosis. \n\n\n\n128 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Omnitrope \n\nDo not use Omnitrope \n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of \n\nOmnitrope. \n• and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour (cancer). Tumours must be inactive and you \n\nmust have finished your anti-tumour treatment before you start your treatment with Omnitrope. \n• and tell your doctor if Omnitrope has been prescribed to stimulate growth but you have already \n\nstopped growing (closed epiphyses). \n• if you are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart surgery, abdominal \n\nsurgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). If you are about to \nhave, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and \nremind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth hormone. \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Omnitrope. \n• If you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids, you should consult your doctor \n\nregularly, as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. \n• If you are at risk of developing diabetes, your doctor will need to monitor your blood sugar \n\nlevel during therapy with somatropin. \n• If you have diabetes, you should closely monitor your blood sugar level during treatment with \n\nsomatropin and discuss the results with your doctor to determine whether you need to change \nthe dose of your medicines to treat diabetes. \n\n• After starting somatropin treatment some patients may need to start thyroid hormone \nreplacement. \n\n• If you are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones it may become necessary to adjust your \nthyroid hormone dose. \n\n• If you have raised intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, \nvisual disturbances or vomiting) you should inform your doctor about it. \n\n• If you walk with a limp or if you start to limp during your growth hormone treatment, you \nshould inform your doctor. \n\n• If you are receiving somatropin for growth hormone deficiency following a previous tumour \n(cancer), you should be examined regularly for recurrence of the tumour or any other cancer. \n\n• If you experience worsening abdominal pain you should inform your doctor. \n• Experience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly persons may be more sensitive to the \n\naction of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop side effects. \n\nChildren with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency  \n• Your doctor should examine your kidney function and your growth rate before starting \n\nsomatropin. Medical treatment for your kidney should be continued. Somatropin treatment \nshould be stopped at kidney transplantation. \n\nChildren with Prader-Willi syndrome  \n• Your doctor will give you diet restrictions to follow to control your weight. \n• Your doctor will assess you for signs of upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea (where your \n\nbreathing is interrupted during sleep), or respiratory infection before you start treatment with \nsomatropin. \n\n• During treatment with somatropin, tell your doctor if you show signs of upper airway \nobstruction (including starting to snore or worsening of snoring), your doctor will need to \nexamine you and may interrupt treatment with somatropin. \n\n• During treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of scoliosis, a type of spinal deformity. \n• During treatment, if you develop a lung infection, tell your doctor so that he can treat the \n\ninfection. \n\n\n\n129 \n\nChildren born small or too light at birth \n• If you were too small or too light at birth and are aged between 9 and 12 years, ask your doctor \n\nfor specific advice relating to puberty and treatment with this medicine. \n• Treatment should be continued until you have stopped growing. \n• Your doctor will check your blood sugar and insulin levels before the start of treatment and \n\nevery year during treatment. \n\nOther medicines and Omnitrope \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\nIn particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Omnitrope or of the other medicines: \n\n• medicine to treat diabetes,  \n• thyroid hormones, \n• medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants),  \n• ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune system after transplantation), \n• oestrogen taken orally or other sex hormones,  \n• synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids).  \nYour doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of somatropin. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou should not use Omnitrope if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Omnitrope \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’. \n\nOmnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection: \nOne ml contains 9 mg benzyl alcohol. \n\nBecause of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature \nbabies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and allergic reactions in infants and children up to \n3 years old. \n\n3.

Do not \nattempt to inject unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements for the injection. \n\n- Omnitrope is given as an injection under the skin.  \n- Carefully inspect the solution before injecting it and use only if clear and colourless. \n- Change the injection sites to minimise the risk of local lipoatrophy (local reduction of fatty \n\ntissue under the skin). \n \nPreparation  \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n\n \n\n- a cartridge with Omnitrope solution for injection. \n\n- SurePal, an injection device specifically developed for use with \nOmnitrope solution for injection (not supplied in the pack; see \nInstructions for Use provided with SurePal). \n\n- a pen needle for subcutaneous injection.  \n- 2 cleansing swabs (not supplied in the pack).  \n  \nWash your hands before you continue with the next steps.  \n  \nInjecting Omnitrope  \n- With a cleansing swab, disinfect the rubber membrane of the \n\ncartridge. \n- The contents must be clear and colourless.  \n\n \n\n- Insert the cartridge into the pen for injection. Follow the \nInstructions for Use of the pen injector. To setup the pen dial the \ndose. \n\n \n\n- Select the site of injection. The best sites for injection are tissues \nwith a layer of fat between skin and muscle, such as the thigh or \nbelly (except the navel or waistline). \n\n \n\n- Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and \nthat you change the places where you inject, as you have been \ntaught. \n\n \n\n- Before you make an injection, clean your skin well with an alcohol \nswab. Wait for the area to dry. \n\n \n- Insert the needle into the skin in the way your doctor has taught \n\nyou.  \n \n\n  \nAfter injecting  \n- After injection, press the injection site with a small bandage or \n\nsterile gauze for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. \n \n\n- Take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap, and discard \nthe needle. This will keep the Omnitrope solution sterile and \nprevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the pen and the \nneedle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your \npen. \n\n \n\n- Leave the cartridge in the pen, put the cap on the pen, and store it in \nthe refrigerator. \n\n \n\n- The solution should be clear after removal from the refrigerator. Do \nnot use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles.  \n\n \n\n\n\n132 \n\nIf you use more Omnitrope than you should \n\nIf you inject much more than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Your \nblood sugar level could fall too low and later rise too high. You might feel shaky, sweaty, sleepy or \n“not yourself”, and you might faint. \n\nIf you forget to use Omnitrope \n\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. It is best to use your growth hormone \nregularly. If you forget to use a dose, have your next injection at the usual time the next day. Keep a \nnote of any missed injections and tell your doctor at your next check-up. \n\nIf you stop using Omnitrope \n\nAsk for advice from your doctor before you stop using Omnitrope. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The very \ncommon and common side effects in adults may start within the first months of treatment and may \neither stop spontaneously or if your dose is reduced. \n\nVery common side effects (likely to occur in more than 1 in 10 patients) include: \n\nIn adults \n• Joint pain \n• Water retention (which shows as puffy fingers or swollen ankles) \n\nCommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Temporary reddening, itchiness or pain at the injection site \n• Joint pain \n\nIn adults \n• Numbness/tingling \n• Stiffness in the arms and legs, muscle pain \n• Pain or burning sensation in the hands or underarms (known as Carpal Tunnel syndrome) \n\nUncommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 100 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Water retention (which shows as puffy fingers or swollen ankles, for a short time at the start of \n\ntreatment) \n\nRare side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 1,000 patients) include: \n\nIn children \n• Numbness/tingling \n• Leukaemia (This has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, \n\nsome of whom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that \nleukaemia incidence is increased in growth hormone recipients without predisposing factors.) \n\n• Increased intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, visual \ndisturbances or vomiting) \n\n• Muscle pain \n\n\n\n133 \n\nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n\n• Type 2 diabetes \n• A decrease in the levels of the hormone Cortisol in your blood \n\nIn children \n• Stiffness in the arms and legs \n\nIn adults \n• Increased intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms such as strong headache, visual \n\ndisturbances or vomiting) \n• Reddening, itchiness or pain at the injection site \n\nFormation of antibodies to the injected growth hormone but these do not seem to stop the growth \nhormone from working. \n\nThe skin around the injection area can get uneven or lumpy, but this should not happen if you inject in \na different place each time. \n\nThere have been rare cases of sudden death in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. However, no link \nhas been made between these cases and treatment with Omnitrope. \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease may be considered by your doctor if \ndiscomfort or pain in the hip or knee is experienced whilst being treated with Omnitrope. \n\nOther possible side effects related to your treatment with growth hormone may include the following: \nYou (or your child) may experience a high blood sugar or reduced levels of thyroid hormone. This can \nbe tested by your doctor and if necessary your doctor will prescribe the adequate treatment. Rarely, an \ninflammation of the pancreas has been reported in patients treated with growth hormone. \n\nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n\n5. How to store Omnitrope \n\nKeep out of the sight and reach of children. \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n• Store and transport refrigerated (2°C–8°C). \n• Do not freeze. \n• Store in the original package in order to protect from light. \n• After the first injection, the cartridge should remain in the pen injector and has to be stored in a \n\nrefrigerator (2°C–8°C) and only used for a maximum of 28 days.  \nDo not use Omnitrope if you notice that the solution is cloudy.  \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n134 \n\n6.

Therefore, in order to achieve an equivalent clinical and \nbiochemical response compared to men dose adjustments may need to be considered by the \nprescriber in female patients. \n\nOmnitrope (MAH: Sandoz), Zomacton and associated names (MAH: Ferring), Norditropin and \nassociated names (MAH: Novo Nordisk), Genotropin and associated names (MAH: Pfizer) \n\nBased on available literature, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can be affected and needs to be \nre-assessed during growth hormone therapy in growth hormone deficient patients, who were \npreviously not found to be deficient in this axis. If necessary, glucocorticoid replacement should be \ninitiated. In addition, patients already receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy may need to \nhave the dose of their replacement therapy adjusted, after somatropin treatment is initiated.  \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for somatropin the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing somatropin is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
