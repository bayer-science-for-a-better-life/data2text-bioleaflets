NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIDflu 15 microgram/strain suspension for injection \nInfluenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInfluenza virus (inactivated, split) of the following strains*: \n \nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 - like strain (A/California/7/2009, NYMC X-179A)\n .............................................................................................................................. 15 micrograms HA** \n \nA/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) - like strain (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, NYMC X-263B)\n .............................................................................................................................. 15 micrograms HA** \n \nB/Brisbane/60/2008 - like strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008, wild type) ..................... 15 micrograms HA** \n \nPer 0.1 ml dose \n \n* propagated in fertilised hens\u2019 eggs from healthy chicken flocks \n** haemagglutinin \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendations (Northern Hemisphere) and EU decision for \nthe 2016/2017 season. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \nIDflu may contain residues of eggs such as ovalbumin and residues of neomycin, formaldehyde and \noctoxinol 9, which are used during the manufacturing process (see section 4.3). \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nColourless and opalescent suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in individuals 60 years of age and over, especially in those who run an \nincreased risk of associated complications. \n \nThe use of IDflu should be based on official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nIndividuals 60 years of age and over: 0.1 ml. \n \nPaediatric population \nIDflu is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to insufficient data \non safety and efficacy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intradermal route. \nThe recommended site of administration is the region of the deltoid. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to any \nresidues such as eggs (ovalbumin, chicken proteins), neomycin, formaldehyde and octoxinol 9.  \n \nImmunisation shall be postponed in subjects with febrile illness or acute infection. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nIDflu should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nVery limited data in immunocompromised patients are available for IDflu. \n \nIn case of presence of liquid at the injection site after vaccine administration, re-vaccination is not \nrequired. \n \nInterference with serological testing: See section 4.5. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIDflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to \ndetect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed. The Western \nBlot technique disproves the false-positive ELISA test results. The transient false positive reactions \ncould be due to the IgM response by the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThis vaccine is intended for individuals 60 years of age and over. Therefore, this information is not \napplicable. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIDflu has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of IDflu has been assessed in 3 open-label randomised clinical trials, 3,372 vaccinees \nreceived an injection of IDflu. \n \nSafety evaluation was performed for all subjects during the first 3 weeks following vaccination and \nserious adverse reactions were collected during six months of follow-up for 2,974 subjects \n(population of two out of the three clinical trials). \n \nThe most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were local reactions at injection \nsite. \nApparent local reactions after intradermal administration were more frequent than after intramuscular \nadministration of an adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine. \nMost reactions resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days after onset. \n \nSystemic safety profile of IDflu is similar to the comparator vaccine, adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted, \nadministered intramuscularly. \n \nAfter repetitive yearly injections the safety profile of IDflu is similar to the previous injections. \n \nb. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe data below summarizes the frequencies of the adverse reactions that were recorded following \nvaccination during clinical trials and worldwide post-marketing experience, using the following \nconvention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nOrgan class Very \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \nrare \n\nNot known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n \n\n     Allergic \nreactions \nincluding \ngeneralized \nskin reactions \nsuch as \nurticaria, \nanaphylactic \nreactions, \nangioedema, \nshock \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache   Paresthesia, \nneuritis \n \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Sweating Pruritus, \nrash \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMyalgia  Arthralgia    \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nLocal \nreactions: \nredness*, \ninduration \nswelling, \npruritus, pain \n\nMalaise, \nshivering, \nfever, \n \nLocal \nreactions: \necchymosis \n\nFatigue    \n\n* In some cases, local redness lasted up to 7 days. \n \nc. Potential adverse events \n \nBased on the experience with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines administered by intramuscular \nor deep subcutaneous injection, the following events may be reported: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nTransient thrombocytopenia, transient lymphadenopathy \n \nNervous system disorders \nNeuralgia, febrile convulsions, neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 \nsyndrome \n \nVascular disorders \nVasculitis associated in very rare cases with transient renal involvement \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose is unlikely to have any untoward effect. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Influenza vaccines, ATC code: J07BB02 \n \nImmunogenicity \nSeroprotection is generally obtained within 2 to 3 weeks. The duration of postvaccinal immunity to \nhomologous strains or to strains closely related to the vaccine strains varies but is usually \n6-12 months. \n \nIn a pivotal randomised comparative phase III trial, 2,606 subjects over 60 years of age received \n0.1 ml of IDflu by intradermal route and 1,089 subjects over 60 years of age received 0.5 ml of a \ntrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administered by intramuscular route. \n \nIn this comparative trial the geometric mean titres (GMTs), seroprotection rate*, seroconversion or \nsignificant increase rate** and the geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR) for anti-HA antibody \n(measured by HI) were assessed according to predefined criteria. \n \nData were as follows (values in brackets show the 95% confidence intervals): \n \n\n Intradermal 15\u00b5g \n\n A/H1N1 A/H3N2 B \n\n A/New Caledonia/ 20/99 A/Wisconsin/ 67/2005 B/Malaysia/ 2506/2004 \n N = 2,585 N = 2,586 N = 2,582 \n\nGeometric mean of titre (1/dil) 81.7 \n(78.0 ; 85.6) \n\n298.0 \n(282 ; 315) \n\n39.9 \n(38.3 ; 41.6) \n\nSeroprotection rate (%) * 77.0 \n(75.3 ; 78.6) \n\n93.3 \n(92.3 ; 94.3) \n\n55.7 \n(53.8 ; 57.6) \n\nSeroconversion or significant \nincrease rate (%) ** \n\n38.7 \n(36.8 ; 40.6) \n\n61.3 \n(59.3 ; 63.1) \n\n36.4 \n(34.5 ; 38.3) \n\nGeometric mean of titre ratio \n(GMTR) \n\n3.97 \n(3.77 ; 4.18) \n\n8.19 \n(7.68 ; 8.74) \n\n3.61 \n(3.47 ; 3.76) \n\n* Seroprotection = HI titre \u2265 40 \n** Seroconversion = negative pre-vaccination HI titre and post vaccination HI titre \u2265 40, Significant \nincrease = positive pre-vaccination HI titre and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI titre \nGMTR: Geometric mean titre ratio of individual (post-/pre-vaccination titre). \n \nIDflu is at least as immunogenic as the comparator trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine \nadministered by intramuscular route for each of the 3 influenza strains in subjects from 60 years of \nage and over. \n \nAcross all three influenza strains, for the comparator intramuscular vaccine GMTs ranged between \n34.8 (1/dil) and 181.0 (1/dil), seroprotection rates ranged between 48.9% and 87.9%, seroconversion \nor significant increase rates ranged between 30.0% and 46.9% and GMTRs ranged between 3.04 and \n5.35-fold over baseline HI titres. \n \nIn a randomised comparative phase III trial, 398 subjects over 65 years of age received 0.1 ml of IDflu \nby intradermal route and 397 subjects over 65 years of age received 0.5 ml of a trivalent inactivated \nadjuvanted (MF-59 containing) influenza vaccine at the same dosage administered by intramuscular \nroute. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nIDflu is as immunogenic as the comparator trivalent adjuvanted (MF-59 containing) vaccine in terms \nof GMT for each of the 3 influenza strains with the SRH method and for 2 strains with the HI method. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on animal studies. The vaccine was \nimmunogenic in mice and rabbits. In repeated-dose toxicity studies in rabbits there was no significant \nevidence of systemic toxicity. Nevertheless, single and repeated administrations led to transient local \nerythema and oedema. Genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential were not assessed because these \nstudies are not appropriate for a vaccine. Fertility and toxicity studies to reproduction in females have \nnot identified any specific potential hazard for humans. \n \n \n6.
