NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMemantine Merz 10 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 10 mg of memantine hydrochloride equivalent to 8.31 mg memantine. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nPale yellow to yellow, oval shaped film-coated tablet with breaking line and engravings \"1-0\" on one \nside and \"M M\" on the other side. \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer’s dementia. \n \nPosology \n \nTherapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the \nmedicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The \ntolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient’s \ntolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the \npatient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when \nevidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment. \n \nAdults \nDose titration \nThe maximum daily dose is 20 mg per day. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects the \nmaintenance dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows: \n \nWeek 1 (day 1-7): \nThe patient should take half a 10 mg film-coated tablet (5 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 2 (day 8-14): \nThe patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet (10 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 3 (day 15-21): \nThe patient should take one and a half 10 mg film-coated tablet (15 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nFrom Week 4 on: \nThe patient should take two 10 mg film-coated tablets (20 mg) per day. \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day. \n \nElderly \nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is 20 mg \nper day (two 10 mg tablets once a day) as described above. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min) no dose \nadjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n30 - 49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, \nthe dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 – 29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) no dose \nadjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are \navailable. Administration of Memantine Merz is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nMemantine Merz is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety \nand efficacy. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nMemantine Merz should be administered once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. \nThe film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy. \n \nConcomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or \ndextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as \nmemantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be \nmore frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5). \n \nSome factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 “Elimination”) may necessitate careful \nmonitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by \nstates of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. \n \nIn most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart \nfailure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited \ndata are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following \ninteractions may occur: \n \n• The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and \n\nanticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as \nmemantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant \nadministration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify \ntheir effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. \n\n• Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of \npharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The \nsame may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one \npublished case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. \n\n• Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and \nnicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly \ninteract with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. \n\n• There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when \nmemantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. \n\n• In post-marketing experience isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases \nhave been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal \nrelationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for \npatients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. \n\n \nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects no relevant active substance-\nactive substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. \n \nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics \nof galantamine was observed. \n \nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, \nepoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nFor memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a \npotential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher \nthan at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nModerate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and \ncompromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Memantine Merz has minor to moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take \nspecial care. \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Memantine Merz and \n1,595 patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Memantine \nMerz did not differ from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in \nseverity. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Memantine \nMerz group than in the placebo group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs \n3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). \n \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies \nwith Memantine Merz and since its introduction in the market. Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections \nImmune systeme disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity \nPsychiatric disorders Common Somnolence \n Uncommon Confusion \n Uncommon Hallucinations1 \n Not known Psychotic reactions2 \nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \n Common Balance disorder \n Uncommon Gait abnormal \n Very rare  Seizures \nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure \nVascular disorders Common Hypertension \n Uncommon Venous \n\nthrombosis/thromboembolism  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Constipation \n Uncommon Vomiting \n Not known Pancreatitis2 \nHepatobiliary disorders Common Elevated liver function test \n Not known Hepatitis \nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nCommon Headache \n\n Uncommon Fatigue \n1 Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer´s disease. \n2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nAlzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-\nmarketing experience these events have been reported in patients treated with Memantine Merz. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nSymptoms \n \nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with \neither only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases \nbelow 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system \n(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) \nand/or gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). \n \nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and \nagitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered \nwithout permanent sequelae. \n \nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received \n400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as \nrestlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and \nunconsciousness. \n \nTreatment \n \nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or \noverdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric \nlavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, \nforced diuresis should be used as appropriate. \n \nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n \nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in \nneurodegenerative dementia. \n \nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction. \n \nClinical studies \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe \nAlzheimer’s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) \nincluded a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in \ncomparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 7 \n\nimpression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of \ndaily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed \na statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: \nAlzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate \nAlzheimer’s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. \nIn the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary \nefficacy endpoint at week 24. \n \nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) \nfrom the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies \nwith patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically \nsignificant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. \nWhen patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a \nstatistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated \npatients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, \np<0.0001). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. \nThere is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. \n \nDistribution \n \nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to \n150 ng/ml (0.5 - 1 µmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. \nMain human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and \n6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit \nNMDA-antagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. \n \nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within \n20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally. \n \nElimination \n \nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60 to 100 hours. In \nvolunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m² and part \nof total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. \n \nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The \nrenal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to \n9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore \nto a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nLinearity \n \nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) \nof memantine, which is 0.5 µmol in human frontal cortex. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn short term studies in rats memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal \nvacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum \nconcentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the \neffects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but \nnot in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not \ndisclose any ocular changes. \n \nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was \nobserved in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic \nproperties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed \nin lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown. \n \nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on \nfertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMemantine Merz 5mg/pump actuation, oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 g of solution contains 10 mg of memantine hydrochloride equivalent to 8.31 mg memantine. \n \nEach pump actuation delivers 0.5 ml solution which contains 5 mg of memantine hydrochloride which is \nequivalent to 4.16 mg memantine. \n \nExcipients: Each one millilitre of solution contains 100 mg sorbitol (E 420) and 0.5 mg potassium, see \nsection 4.4. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution. \nThe solution is clear and colourless to light yellowish. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer’s dementia. \n \nPosology \n \nTherapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the \nmedicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The \ntolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient’s \ntolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the \npatient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when \nevidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment. \n \nAdults \nDose titration \nThe maximum daily dose is 20 mg once daily. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects the \nmaintenance dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows: \n \nWeek 1 (day 1-7): \nThe patient should take 0.5 ml solution (5 mg) equivalent to one pump actuation per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 2 (day 8-14): \nThe patient should take 1 ml solution (10 mg) equivalent to two pump actuations  per day for 7 days. \n \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nWeek 3 (day 15-21): \nThe patient should take 1.5 ml solution (15 mg) equivalent to three pump actuations per day for 7 days. \n \nFrom Week 4 on: \nThe patient should take 2 ml solution (20 mg) equivalent to four pump actuations once a day. \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg (2 ml solution, equivalent to four pump actuations) per \nday. \n \nElderly \nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is 20 mg \nper day (2 ml solution, equivalent to four pump actuations) as described above. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min) no dose \nadjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n30 - 49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two pump actuations). If \ntolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according \nto standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n5 - 29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two pump actuations) per day. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) no dose \nadjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are \navailable. Administration of Memantine Merz in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nMemantine Merz is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety \nand efficacy. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nMemantine Merz should be taken once daily at the same time each day. The solution can be taken with \nor without food. The solution must not be poured or pumped into the mouth directly from the bottle or \nthe pump, but should be dosed onto a spoon or into a glass of water using the pump. For detailed \ninstructions on the preparation and handling of the product see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy. \n \nConcomitant use of other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine \nor dextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as \nmemantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related may be \nmore frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5). \n \nSome factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 “Elimination”) may necessitate careful \nmonitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by \nstates of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n \nIn most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart \nfailure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited \ndata are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. \n \nExcipients: The oral solution contains sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following \ninteractions may occur: \n \n• The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and \n\nanticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as \nmemantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant \nadministration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify \ntheir effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. \n\n• Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of \npharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The \nsame may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one \npublished case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. \n\n• Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and \nnicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly \ninteract with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. \n\n• There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when \nmemantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. \n\n• In post-marketing experience isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases \nhave been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal \nrelationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for \npatients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. \n\n \nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects no relevant active \nsubstance-active substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was \nobserved. \n \nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics \nof galantamine was observed. \n \nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, \nepoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nFor memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a \npotential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher \nthan at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. \n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nFertility \n \nNo adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nModerate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and \ncompromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Memantine Merz has minor or moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take \nspecial care. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Memantine Merz and \n1,595 patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Memantine \nMerz did not differ from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in \nseverity. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Memantine \nMerz group than in the placebo group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs \n3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). \n \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies \nwith Memantine Merz and since its introduction in the market. Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections \nImmune systeme disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity \nPsychiatric disorders Common Somnolence \n Uncommon Confusion \n Uncommon Hallucinations1 \n Not known Psychotic reactions2 \nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \n Common Balance disorder \n Uncommon Gait abnormal \n Very rare  Seizures \nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure \nVascular disorders Common Hypertension \n Uncommon Venous \n\nthrombosis/thromboembolism  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Constipation \n Uncommon Vomiting \n Not known Pancreatitis2 \nHepatobiliary disorders Common Elevated liver function test \n Not known Hepatitis \nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nCommon Headache \n\n Uncommon Fatigue \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n1 Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer´s disease. \n2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nAlzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-\nmarketing experience these events have been reported in patients treated with Memantine Merz. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nSymptoms \n \nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with \neither only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases \nbelow 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system \n(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination and gait disturbance) \nand/or gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). \n \nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and \nagitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered \nwithout permanent sequelae. \n \nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received \n400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as \nrestlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and \nunconsciousness. \n \nTreatment \n \nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or \noverdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric \nlavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, \nforced diuresis should be used as appropriate. \n \nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n \nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in \nneurodegenerative dementia. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 16 \n\nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction. \n \nClinical studies \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe \nAlzheimer’s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) \nincluded a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in \ncomparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based \nimpression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of \ndaily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed \na statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: \nAlzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate \nAlzheimer’s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. \nIn the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary \nefficacy endpoint at week 24. \n \nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) \nfrom the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies \nwith patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically \nsignificant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. \nWhen patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a \nstatistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated \npatients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, \np<0.0001). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. \nThere is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. \n \nDistribution \n \nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to \n150 ng/ml (0.5 - 1 µmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. \nMain human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and \n6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane.

For removing the screw cap from \nthe bottle the cap must be turned anticlockwise and unscrewed completely (fig.1). \n\n \n \nMounting the dosing pump on the bottle: \n \nThe dosing pump has to be removed from the plastic bag (fig. 2) and placed on top of the bottle, \nsliding the plastic dip tube carefully into the bottle. Then the dosing pump needs to be hold onto the \nneck of the bottle and screwed clockwise until it is firmly attached (fig 3). For the intended use the \ndosing pump is only screwed on once when starting the use, and should never be unscrewed. \n \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n \n \nUse of the dosing pump for dispensing: \n \nThe dosing pump head has two positions and is easy to turn – anticlockwise (unlocked position) and \nclockwise (locked position). The dosing pump head should not be pushed down while in the locked \nposition. The solution may only be dispensed in the unlocked position. To do this, the dosing pump \nhead has to be turned in the direction of the arrow about one eighth of a turn, until a resistance is felt \n(fig. 4). \n\n \nThe dosing pump is then ready for use. \n \nPreparing the dosing pump: \n \nWhen used for the first time, the dosing pump does not dispense the correct amount of oral solution. \nTherefore, the pump must be prepared (primed) by pushing the dosing pump head down completely \nfive times in succession (fig. 5). \n\n \nThe solution thus dispensed is discarded. The next time the dosing pump head is pushed downwards \ncompletely (equivalent to one pump actuation), it dispenses the correct dose (1 pump actuation is \nequivalent to 0.5 ml oral solution, and contains 5 mg of the active substance memantine hydrochloride; \nfig. 6). \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n \n \nCorrect use of the dosing pump: \n \nThe bottle should be placed on a flat, horizontal surface, for example a table top, and only use it in a \nvertical position.. A glass with a little water or a spoon should be hold below the nozzle and the dosing \npump head has to be pushed down in a firm but calm and steady manner (not too slowly) right down to \nthe stop (fig. 7, fig. 8). \n\n \nThe dosing pump head can then be released and is ready for the next pump actuation. \n \nThe dosing pump may only be used with the memantine hydrochloride solution in the bottle provided, \nnot for other substances or containers. If the pump does not function as described during intended use \nand according to instruction, the patient should consult the treating physician or a pharmacist. The \ndosing pump should be locked after use. \n \n \n7. MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nMerz Pharmaceuticals GmbH \nEckenheimer Landstr. 100 \nD-60318 Frankfurt/Main \nGermany \n \n \n8.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer’s dementia. \n \nPosology \n \nTherapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the \nmedicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The \ntolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient’s \ntolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the \npatient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when \nevidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment. \n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nAdults \nDose titration \nThe recommended starting dose is 5 mg per day which is stepwise increased over the first 4 weeks of \ntreatment reaching the recommended maintenance dose as follows: \n \nWeek 1 (day 1-7): \nThe patient should take one 5 mg film-coated tablet per day (white to off-white, oval-oblong) for 7 days. \n \nWeek 2 (day 8-14): \nThe patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet per day (pale yellow to yellow, oval shaped) for \n7 days. \n \nWeek 3 (day 15-21): \nThe patient should take one 15 mg film-coated tablet per day (greyorange, oval-oblong) for 7 days. \n \nWeek 4 (day 22-28): \nThe patient should take one 20 mg film-coated tablet per day (grey-red, oval-oblong) for 7 days. \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day. \n \nElderly \nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is \n20 mg per day (20 mg once a day) as described above. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 – 80 ml/min) no dose \nadjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n30 - 49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, \nthe dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 – 29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) no dose \nadjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are \navailable. Administration of Memantine Merz in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nMemantine Merz is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on \nsafety and efficacy. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nMemantine Merz should be administered once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. \nThe film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy. \n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nConcomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or \ndextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as \nmemantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be \nmore frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5). \n \nSome factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 “Elimination”) may necessitate careful \nmonitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by \nstates of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. \n \nIn most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart \nfailure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited \ndata are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following \ninteractions may occur: \n \n• The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and \n\nanticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as \nmemantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant \nadministration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify \ntheir effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. \n\n• Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of \npharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The \nsame may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one \npublished case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. \n\n• Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and \nnicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly \ninteract with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. \n\n• There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when \nmemantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. \n\n• In post-marketing experience isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases \nhave been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal \nrelationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for \npatients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. \n\n \nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects no relevant active substance-\nactive substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. \n \nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics \nof galantamine was observed. \n \nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, \nepoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nFor memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a \npotential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher \nthan at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nModerate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and \ncompromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Memantine Merz has minor or moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take \nspecial care. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Memantine Merz and \n1,595 patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Memantine \nMerz did not differ from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in \nseverity. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Memantine \nMerz group than in the placebo group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs \n3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). \n \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies \nwith Memantine Merz and since its introduction in the market. Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections \nImmune systeme disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity \nPsychiatric disorders Common Somnolence \n Uncommon Confusion \n Uncommon Hallucinations1 \n Not known Psychotic reactions2 \nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \n Common Balance disorder \n Uncommon Gait abnormal \n Very rare  Seizures \nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure \nVascular disorders Common Hypertension \n Uncommon Venous \n\nthrombosis/thromboembolism  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Constipation \n Uncommon Vomiting \n Not known Pancreatitis2 \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Elevated liver function test \n Not known Hepatitis \nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nCommon Headache \n\n Uncommon Fatigue \n1 Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer´s disease. \n2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nAlzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-\nmarketing experience these events have been reported in patients treated with Memantine Merz. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nSymptoms \n \nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with \neither only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases \nbelow 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system \n(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) \nand/or gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). \n \nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and \nagitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered \nwithout permanent sequelae. \n \nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received \n400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as \nrestlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and \nunconsciousness. \n \nTreatment \n \nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or \noverdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric \nlavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, \nforced diuresis should be used as appropriate. \n \nIn case of signs and symptoms of general Central Nervous System (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 27 \n\n \nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in \nneurodegenerative dementia. \n \nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction. \n \nClinical studies \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe \nAlzheimer’s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) \nincluded a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in \ncomparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician’s interview based \nimpression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study- activities of \ndaily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed \na statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: \nAlzheimer’s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate \nAlzheimer’s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. \nIn the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary \nefficacy endpoint at week 24. \n \nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) \nfrom the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies \nwith patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically \nsignificant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. \nWhen patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a \nstatistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated \npatients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, \np<0.0001). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. \nThere is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. \n \nDistribution \n \nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to \n150 ng/ml (0.5 - 1 µmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. \nMain human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and 6-hydroxy-\nmemantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-\nantagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. \n \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within \n20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally. \n \nElimination \n \nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60 to 100 hours. In \nvolunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m² and part \nof total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. \n \nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The \nrenal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to \n9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore \nto a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. \n \nLinearity \n \nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) \nof memantine, which is 0.5 µmol in human frontal cortex. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn short term studies in rats memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal \nvacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum \nconcentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the \neffects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but \nnot in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not \ndisclose any ocular changes. \n \nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was \nobserved in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic \nproperties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed \nin lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown. \n \nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on \nfertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer’s dementia. \n \nPosology \n \nTherapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the \nmedicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The \ntolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment.

Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when \nevidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment. \n \nAdults \nDose titration \nThe maximum daily dose is 20 mg per day. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects the \nmaintenance dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows. \nFor up-titration other tablet strengths are available. \n \nWeek 1 (day 1-7): \nThe patient should take one 5 mg film-coated tablet per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 2 (day 8-14): \nThe patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 3 (day 15-21): \nThe patient should take one 15 mg film-coated tablet per day for 7 days. \n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nFrom Week 4 on: \nThe patient should take one 20 mg film-coated tablet per day. \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day. \n \nElderly \nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is \n20 mg per day as described above. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 – 80 ml/min) no dose \nadjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n30 - 49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, \nthe dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme.

No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are \navailable. Administration of Memantine Merz in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nMemantine Merz is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on \nsafety and efficacy. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nMemantine Merz should be administered once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. \nThe film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy. \n \nConcomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or \ndextromethorphan should be avoided.

Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The \nsame may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one \npublished case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. \n\n• Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and \nnicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly \ninteract with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. \n\n• There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when \nmemantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. \n\n• In post-marketing experience isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases \nhave been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal \nrelationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for \npatients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. \n\n \nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects no relevant active substance-\nactive substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. \n \nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics \nof galantamine was observed. \n \nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, \nepoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nFor memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a \npotential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher \nthan at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nModerate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and \ncompromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Memantine Merz has minor or moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take \nspecial care. \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Memantine Merz and \n1,595 patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Memantine \nMerz did not differ from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in \nseverity. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Memantine \nMerz group than in the placebo group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs \n3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). \n \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies \nwith Memantine Merz and since its introduction in the market. Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections \nImmune systeme disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity \nPsychiatric disorders Common Somnolence \n Uncommon Confusion \n Uncommon Hallucinations1 \n Not known Psychotic reactions2 \nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \n Common Balance disorder \n Uncommon Gait abnormal \n Very rare  Seizures \nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure \nVascular disorders Common Hypertension \n Uncommon Venous \n\nthrombosis/thromboembolism  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Constipation \n Uncommon Vomiting \n Not known Pancreatitis2 \nHepatobiliary disorders Common Elevated liver function test \n Not known Hepatitis \nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nCommon Headache \n\n Uncommon Fatigue \n1 Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer´s disease. \n2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nAlzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-\nmarketing experience these events have been reported in patients treated with Memantine Merz. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nSymptoms \n \nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with \neither only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases \nbelow 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system \n(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) \nand/or gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). \n \nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and \nagitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered \nwithout permanent sequelae. \n \nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received \n400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as \nrestlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and \nunconsciousness. \n \nTreatment \n \nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or \noverdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric \nlavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, \nforced diuresis should be used as appropriate. \n \nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n \nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in \nneurodegenerative dementia. \n \nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction. \n \nClinical studies \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe \nAlzheimer’s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) \nincluded a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in \ncomparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 36 \n\nimpression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of \ndaily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed \na statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: \nAlzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) -and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate \nAlzheimer’s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. \nIn the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary \nefficacy endpoint at week 24. \n \nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) \nfrom the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies \nwith patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically \nsignificant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. \nWhen patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a \nstatistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated \npatients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, \np<0.0001). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. \nThere is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. \n \nDistribution \n \nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to \n150 ng/ml (0.5 - 1 µmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. \nMain human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and \n6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit \nNMDA-antagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. \n \nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within \n20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally. \n \nElimination \n \nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60 to 100 hours. In \nvolunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m² and part \nof total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. \n \nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The \nrenal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to \n9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore \nto a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. \n \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nLinearity \n \nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the (CSF) levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) \nof memantine, which is 0.5 µmol in human frontal cortex. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn short term studies in rats memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal \nvacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum \nconcentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the \neffects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but \nnot in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not \ndisclose any ocular changes. \n \nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was \nobserved in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic \nproperties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed \nin lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown. \n \nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on \nfertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure. \n \n \n6.

Measure \nthe dose onto a spoon or into a glass of water, using the pump. \n \nTake the screw cap off the bottle: \n \nThe cap must be turned anticlockwise, unscrewed completely and removed (fig. 1). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.emea.europa.eu/\n\n\n 84 \n\nMounting the dosing pump on the bottle: \n \nTake the dosing pump out of the plastic bag (fig. 2) and place it on top of the bottle. Slide the plastic \ndip tube carefully into the bottle. Hold the dosing pump onto the neck of the bottle and screw it \nclockwise until it fits firmly (fig. 3). The dosing pump is only screwed on once when starting the use, \nand should never be unscrewed. \n\n \n \nHow the dosing pump works: \n \nThe dosing pump head has two positions and is easy to turn: \n- anticlockwise to unlock and  \n- clockwise to lock. \n \nThe dosing pump head should not be pushed down while in the locked position. The solution may only \nbe dispensed in the unlocked position. To unlock, turn the pump head in the direction of the arrow \nuntil it cannot be turned any further (about one eighth of a turn, fig. 4). The dosing pump is then ready \nfor use. \n\n \n \nPreparing the dosing pump: \n \nWhen used for the first time, the dosing pump does not dispense the correct amount of oral solution. \nTherefore, the pump must be prepared (primed) by pushing the dosing pump head down completely \nfive times in succession (fig. 5). \n\n\n\n 85 \n\n \nThe solution thus dispensed is discarded. The next time the dosing pump head is pushed downwards \ncompletely (equivalent to one pump actuation), it dispenses the correct dose (fig. 6). \n\n \nCorrect use of the dosing pump: \n \nPlace the bottle on a flat, horizontal surface, for example a table top, and only use it in a upright \nposition. Hold a glass with a little water or a spoon below the nozzle. Push down the dosing pump \nhead in a firm but calm and steady manner - not too slowly (fig. 7, fig. 8). \n\n \nThe dosing pump head can then be released and is ready for the next pump actuation. \n \nThe dosing pump must only be used with the Memantine Merz solution in the bottle provided, not for \nother substances or containers. If the pump does not function properly, consult your doctor or a \npharmacist.Lock the dosing pump after using Memantine Merz. \n \n\n\n\n 86 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nMemantine Merz 5 mg film-coated tablets \nMemantine Merz 10 mg film-coated tablets \nMemantine Merz 15 mg film-coated tablets \nMemantine Merz 20 mg film-coated tablets \n\nMemantine hydrochloride \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.
