NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXultophy 100 units/mL + 3.6 mg/mL solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 mL solution contains 100 units insulin degludec* and 3.6 mg liraglutide*. \n \n*Produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nOne pre-filled pen contains 3 mL equivalent to 300 units insulin degludec and 10.8 mg liraglutide.  \n \nOne dose step contains 1 unit of insulin degludec and 0.036 mg of liraglutide.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless, isotonic solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXultophy is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus \nto improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to other oral medicinal \nproducts for the treatment of diabetes. For study results with respect to combinations, effects on \nglycaemic control, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nXultophy is given once daily by subcutaneous administration. Xultophy can be administered at any \ntime of the day, preferably at the same time of the day. \n \nXultophy is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patientâ€™s needs. It is recommended to \noptimise glycaemic control via dose adjustment based on fasting plasma glucose.  \n \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. \n \nPatients who forget a dose are advised to take it upon discovery and then resume their usual once-daily \ndosing schedule. A minimum of 8 hours between injections should always be ensured. This also \napplies when administration at the same time of the day is not possible. \n \nXultophy is administered as dose steps. One dose step contains 1 unit of insulin degludec and \n0.036 mg of liraglutide. The pre-filled pen can provide from 1 up to 50 dose steps in one injection in \nincrements of one dose step. The maximum daily dose of Xultophy is 50 dose steps (50 units insulin \ndegludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). The dose counter on the pen shows the number of dose steps. \n \nAdd-on to oral glucose-lowering medicinal products \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Xultophy is 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg \nliraglutide).  \n \nXultophy can be added to existing oral antidiabetic treatment. When Xultophy is added to sulfonylurea \ntherapy, a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nTransfer from GLP-1 receptor agonist \nTherapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists should be discontinued prior to initiation of Xultophy. When \ntransferring from a GLP-1 receptor agonist, the recommended starting dose of Xultophy is 16 dose \nsteps (16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) (see section 5.1). The recommended starting \ndose should not be exceeded. If transferring from a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist (e.g. once-\nweekly dosing), the prolonged action should be considered. Treatment with Xultophy should be \ninitiated at the moment the next dose of the long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist would have been \ntaken. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the following weeks. \n \nTransfer from any insulin regimen that includes a basal insulin component \nTherapy with other insulin regimens should be discontinued prior to initiation of Xultophy. When \ntransferring from any other insulin therapy that includes a basal insulin component, the recommended \nstarting dose of Xultophy is 16 dose steps (16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) (see \nsection 4.4 and 5.1). The recommended starting dose should not be exceeded, but may be reduced to \navoid hypoglycaemia in selected cases. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer \nand in the following weeks.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (â‰¥65 years old) \nXultophy can be used in elderly patients. Glucose monitoring is to be intensified and the dose adjusted \non an individual basis.  \n \nRenal impairment  \nWhen Xultophy is used in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, glucose \nmonitoring is to be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. Xultophy cannot be \nrecommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment  \nXultophy can be used in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Glucose monitoring is to \nbe intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis.  \nDue to the liraglutide component, Xultophy is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population  \nThere is no relevant use of Xultophy in the paediatric population.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nXultophy is for subcutaneous use only. Xultophy must not be administered intravenously or \nintramuscularly. \n \nXultophy is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh, the upper arm or the abdomen. \nInjection sites are always to be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of \nlipodystrophy. For further instructions on administration, see section 6.6. \n \nXultophy must not be drawn from the cartridge of the pre-filled pen into a syringe (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients should be instructed to always use a new needle. The re-use of insulin pen needles increases \nthe risk of blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In the event of blocked needles, \npatients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for use accompanying the package \n\n\n\n4 \n\nleaflet (see section 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to either or both active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nXultophy should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the dose of Xultophy is higher than required. Omission of a meal or \nunplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. In combination with sulfonylurea, \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea. Concomitant \ndiseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland may require \nchanges of the Xultophy dose. Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved (e.g. by \nintensified therapy) may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and \nmust be advised accordingly. Usual warning symptoms (see section 4.8) of hypoglycaemia may \ndisappear in patients with long-standing diabetes. The prolonged effect of Xultophy may delay \nrecovery from hypoglycaemia. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nInadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of antidiabetic treatment may lead to hyperglycaemia and \npotentially to hyperosmolar coma. In case of discontinuation of Xultophy, ensure that instruction for \ninitiation of alternative antidiabetic treatment is followed. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially \ninfections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased requirement for antidiabetic \ntreatment. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop gradually over a period of hours or \ndays. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry \nskin, dry mouth, and loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath.  \nAdministration of rapid-acting insulin should be considered in situations of severe hyperglycaemia. \nUntreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to hyperosmolar coma/diabetic ketoacidosis, which \nis potentially lethal. \n \nCombination of pioglitazone and insulin medicinal products \n \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin \nmedicinal products, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac failure. This \nshould be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Xultophy is considered. \nIf the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs. \n \nEye disorder \n \nIntensification of therapy with insulin, a component of Xultophy, with abrupt improvement in \nglycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-\nterm improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nAntibody formation \n \nAdministration of Xultophy may cause formation of antibodies against insulin degludec and/or \nliraglutide. In rare cases, the presence of such antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the Xultophy \ndose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia. Very few patients developed insulin \ndegludec specific antibodies, antibodies cross-reacting to human insulin or anti-liraglutide antibodies \n\n\n\n5 \n\nfollowing treatment with Xultophy. Antibody formation has not been associated with reduced efficacy \nof Xultophy. \n \nAcute pancreatitis \n \nAcute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide. \nPatients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is \nsuspected, Xultophy should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, Xultophy should not be \nrestarted.  \n \nThyroid adverse events \n \nThyroid adverse events, such as goitre have been reported in clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor \nagonists including liraglutide, and in particular in patients with pre-existing thyroid disease. Xultophy \nshould therefore be used with caution in these patients.  \n \nInflammatory bowel disease and diabetic gastroparesis \n \nThere is no experience with Xultophy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and diabetic \ngastroparesis. Xultophy is therefore not recommended in these patients.  \n \nDehydration \n \nSigns and symptoms of dehydration, including renal impairment and acute renal failure have been \nreported in clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists including liraglutide, a component of Xultophy. \nPatients treated with Xultophy should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to \ngastrointestinal side effects and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. \n \nAvoidance of medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the pen label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between Xultophy and other injectable diabetes medicinal products. \n \nPatients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the \nrequirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who \nare blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who \nhas good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. \n \nTo avoid dosing errors and potential overdose, patients and healthcare professionals should never use a \nsyringe to draw the medicinal product from the cartridge in the pre-filled pen. \n \nIn the event of blocked needles, patients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for \nuse accompanying the package leaflet (see section 6.6). \n \nPopulations not studied \n \nTransfer to Xultophy from doses of basal insulin <20 and >50 units has not been studied. \n \nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart \nAssociation (NYHA) class IV and Xultophy is therefore not recommended for use in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nXultophy contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, therefore the medicinal product is \nessentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \nTraceability \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nInteraction studies with Xultophy have not been performed.  \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of Xultophy. \n \nThe following substances may reduce the Xultophy requirement: \nAntidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, angiotensin \nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the Xultophy requirement: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormones and danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the Xultophy requirement. \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of Xultophy. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nIn vitro data suggest that the potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions related to CYP interaction \nand protein binding is low for both liraglutide and insulin degludec. \n \nThe small delay of gastric emptying with liraglutide may influence absorption of concomitantly \nadministered oral medicinal products. Interaction studies did not show any clinically relevant delay of \nabsorption.  \n \nWarfarin and other coumarin derivatives \nNo interaction study has been performed. A clinically relevant interaction with active substances with \npoor solubility or with narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin cannot be excluded. Upon initiation \nof Xultophy treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives more frequent monitoring \nof INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended. \n \nParacetamol  \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of paracetamol following a single dose of 1,000 mg. \nParacetamol Cmax was decreased by 31% and median tmax was delayed up to 15 min. No dose \nadjustment for concomitant use of paracetamol is required. \n \nAtorvastatin \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin to a clinical relevant degree following \nsingle dose administration of atorvastatin 40 mg. Therefore, no dose adjustment of atorvastatin is \nrequired when given with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median tmax was \ndelayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. \n \nGriseofulvin \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of griseofulvin following administration of a single \ndose of griseofulvin 500 mg. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median tmax did not change. \nDose adjustments of griseofulvin and other compounds with low solubility and high permeability are \nnot required. \n \nDigoxin \nA single dose administration of digoxin 1 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC \nby 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximum concentration (tmax) was delayed \n\n\n\n7 \n\nfrom 1 h to 1.5 h. No dose adjustment of digoxin is required based on these results. \n \nLisinopril \nA single dose administration of lisinopril 20 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril \nAUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with \nliraglutide. No dose adjustment of lisinopril is required based on these results. \n \nOral contraceptives \nLiraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12 and 13%, respectively, following \nadministration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. Tmax was delayed by 1.5 h with \nliraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of \neither ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be \nunaffected when co-administered with liraglutide. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no clinical experience with the use of Xultophy, insulin degludec or liraglutide in pregnant \nwomen. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, treatment with Xultophy should \nbe discontinued. \n \nAnimal reproduction studies with insulin degludec have not revealed any differences between insulin \ndegludec and human insulin regarding embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. Animal studies with \nliraglutide have shown reproductive toxicity, see section 5.3. The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is no clinical experience with the use of Xultophy during breast-feeding. It is not known \nwhether insulin degludec or liraglutide is excreted in human milk. Because of lack of experience, \nXultophy should not be used during breast-feeding.  \nIn rats, insulin degludec was secreted in milk; the concentration in milk was lower than in plasma. \nAnimal studies have shown that the transfer of liraglutide and metabolites of close structural \nrelationship into milk was low. Non-clinical studies with liraglutide have shown a treatment-related \nreduction of neonatal growth in suckling rat pups (see section 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no clinical experience with Xultophy in relation to fertility.  \nAnimal reproduction studies with insulin degludec have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. \nApart from a slight decrease in the number of live implants, animal studies with liraglutide did not \nindicate harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patientâ€™s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using \nmachines). \n \nPatients must be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is particularly \nimportant in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or \nhave frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these \ncircumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe Xultophy clinical development programme included approximately 1,900 patients treated with \nXultophy.  \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment with Xultophy were hypoglycaemia \nand gastrointestinal adverse reactions (see section â€˜Description of selected adverse reactionsâ€™ below). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions associated with Xultophy are given below, listed by system organ class and \nfrequency. Frequency categories are defined as: Very common (â‰¥1/10); common (â‰¥1/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (â‰¥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (â‰¥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported in phase 3 controlled studies \n\nMedDRA System organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders Uncommon Urticaria \n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity \nUnknown Anaphylactic reaction \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common Hypoglycaemia \nCommon Decreased appetite \nUncommon Dehydration \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, \ndyspepsia, gastritis, abdominal pain, \ngastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal \ndistension \n\nUncommon Eructation, flatulence \nUnknown Pancreatitis (including necrotising \n\npancreatitis ) \nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon Cholelithiasis \n\nUncommon Cholecystitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Rash \nUncommon Pruritus \nUncommon Lipodystrophy acquired \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site condition \n\nCommon Injection site reaction \nUnknown Peripheral oedema \n\nInvestigation Common Increased lipase \nCommon Increased amylase \nUncommon Increased heart rate  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the Xultophy dose is higher than required. Severe hypoglycaemia may \nlead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of \nbrain function or even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may \ninclude cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or \nweakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, \nheadache, nausea and palpitation. For frequencies of hypoglycaemia, please see section 5.1. \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions (manifested with signs and symptoms such as urticaria (0.3% of patients treated \nwith Xultophy), rash (0.7%), pruritus (0.5%) and/or swelling of the face (0.2%)) have been reported \nfor Xultophy. Few cases of anaphylactic reactions with additional symptoms such as hypotension, \n\n\n\n9 \n\npalpitations, dyspnoea, and oedema have been reported during marketed use of liraglutide. \nAnaphylactic reactions may potentially be life threatening.  \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions may occur more frequently at the beginning of Xultophy therapy \nand usually diminish within a few days or weeks on continued treatment. Nausea was reported in 7.8% \nof patients and was transient in nature for most patients. The proportion of patients reporting nausea \nper week at any point during treatment was below 4%. Diarrhoea and vomiting were reported in 7.5% \nand 3.9% of patients, respectively. The frequency of nausea and diarrhoea was â€˜Commonâ€™ for \nXultophy and â€˜Very commonâ€™ for liraglutide. In addition, constipation, dyspepsia, gastritis, abdominal \npain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal distension, eructation, flatulence and decreased \nappetite have been reported in up to 3.6% of patients treated with Xultophy.  \n \nInjection site reactions \nInjection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemmorrhage, erythema, nodules, \nswelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) have been reported in 2.6% of \npatients treated with Xultophy. These reactions were usually mild and transitory and they normally \ndisappear during continued treatment. \n \nLipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous \nrotation of the injection site within the particular injection area may help to reduce the risk of \ndeveloping these reactions. \n \nIncreased heart rate  \nMean increase in heart rate from baseline of 2 to 3 beats per minute has been observed in clinical trials \nwith Xultophy. In the LEADER trial, no long-term clinical impact of increased heart rate on the risk of \ncardiovascular events was observed with liraglutide (a component of Xultophy) (see section 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited data are available with regard to overdose of Xultophy.  \n \nHypoglycaemia may develop if a patient is dosed with more Xultophy than required: \n \nâ€¢ Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or other products \n\ncontaining sugar. It is therefore recommended that the patient always carries sugar-containing \nproducts \n\nâ€¢ Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient is not able to treat himself, can be treated \nwith glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or \nwith glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given \nintravenously if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon \nregaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in \norder to prevent a relapse. \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting. \nATC code: A10AE56  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nXultophy is a combination product consisting of insulin degludec and liraglutide having \ncomplementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control. \n \nInsulin degludec is a basal insulin that forms soluble multi-hexamers upon subcutaneous injection, \nresulting in a depot from which insulin degludec is continuously and slowly absorbed into the \ncirculation leading to a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect of insulin degludec with a low day-to-\nday variability in insulin action. \n \nInsulin degludec binds specifically to the human insulin receptor and results in the same \npharmacological effects as human insulin.  \n \nThe blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin degludec is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose \nfollowing the binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition \nof glucose output from the liver. \n \nLiraglutide is a Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with 97% sequence homology to human \nGLP-1 that binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Following subcutaneous \nadministration, the protracted action profile is based on three mechanisms: self-association, which \nresults in slow absorption; binding to albumin; and higher enzymatic stability towards the dipeptidyl \npeptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) enzymes, resulting in a long plasma half-life. \n \nLiraglutide action is mediated via a specific interaction with GLP-1 receptors and improves glycaemic \ncontrol by lowering fasting and postprandial blood glucose. Liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion \nand lowers inappropriately high glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood \nglucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited. Conversely, during \nhypoglycaemia liraglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. The \nmechanism of blood glucose-lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying.  \n \nLiraglutide reduces body weight and body fat mass through mechanisms involving reduced hunger and \nlowered energy intake. \n \nGLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake, but the exact mechanism of action is \nnot entirely clear. In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide led to uptake in specific \nbrain regions involved in regulation of appetite, where liraglutide, via specific activation of the GLP-\n1R, increased key satiety and decreased key hunger signals, thereby leading to lower body weight. \n \nGLP-1 receptors are also expressed in specific locations in the heart, vasculature, immune system, and \nkidneys. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, liraglutide prevented aortic plaque progression and \nreduced inflammation in the plaque. In addition, liraglutide had a beneficial effect on plasma lipids. \nLiraglutide did not reduce the plaque size of already established plaques. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nXultophy has a stable pharmacodynamic profile with a duration of action reflecting the combination of \nthe individual action profiles of insulin degludec and liraglutide that allows for administration of \nXultophy once daily at any time of the day with or without meals. Xultophy improves glycaemic \ncontrol through the sustained lowering of fasting plasma glucose levels and postprandial glucose levels \nafter all meals.  \n \nPostprandial glucose reduction was confirmed in a 4 hour standardised meal test substudy in patients \nuncontrolled on metformin alone or in combination with pioglitazone. Xultophy decreased the \npostprandial plasma glucose excursion (mean over 4 hours) significantly more than insulin degludec. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nThe results were similar for Xultophy and liraglutide. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Xultophy were evaluated in seven randomised, controlled, parallel group \nphase 3 trials in different populations of subjects with type 2 diabetes defined by previous antidiabetes \ntreatment. Comparator treatments comprised basal insulin, GLP-1 RA therapy, placebo and a basal \nbolus regimen. The trials were of 26 weeks duration randomising between 199 and 833 patients to \nXultophy. One study was further extended to 52 weeks. In all trials, the starting dose was given \naccording to label and a twice-weekly titration regimen for Xultophy was used (see Table 2). The \nsame titration algorithm was applied for basal insulin comparators. In six studies, Xultophy produced \nclinically and statistically significant improvements in glycaemic control versus comparators as \nmeasured by glycated haemaglobin A1c (HbA1c), whereas one study demonstrated a similar reduction \nof HbA1c in both treatment arms. \n \nTable 2 Titration of Xultophy \n\nPre-breakfast plasma glucose* Dose adjustment (twice weekly) \nmmol/L mg/dL Xultophy (dose steps) \n\n<4.0 <72 -2 \n4.0â€“5.0 72â€“90 0 \n\n>5.0 >90 +2 \n*Self-measured plasma glucose. In the trial investigating Xultophy as add on to sulfonylurea the target was 4.0-6.0 mmol/L \n \nâ€¢ Glycaemic control \n \nAdd-on to oral glucose-lowering medicinal products  \nAdding Xultophy to metformin alone or in combination with pioglitazone in a 26-week randomised, \ncontrolled, open-label trial resulted in 60.4% of patients treated with Xultophy reaching a target of \nHbA1c <7% without confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes after 26 weeks of treatment. The proportion \nwas significantly larger than observed with insulin degludec (40.9%, odds ratio 2.28, p <0.0001) and \nsimilar to that observed with liraglutide (57.7%, odds ratio 1.13, p=0.3184). The key results of the trial \nare listed in Figure 1 and Table 3. \n \nRates of confirmed hypoglycaemia were lower with Xultophy than with insulin degludec irrespective \nof the glycaemic control, see Figure 1. The rate per patient year of exposure (percentage of patients) of \nsevere hypoglycaemia defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person was 0.01 \n(2 patients out of 825) for Xultophy, 0.01 (2 patients out of 412) for insulin degludec and 0.00 \n(0 patients out of 412) for liraglutide. The rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemic events was similar with \nXultophy and insulin degludec treatment. \n \nPatients treated with Xultophy overall experienced less gastrointestinal side effects than patients \ntreated with liraglutide. This might be due to the slower increase in the dose of the liraglutide \ncomponent during treatment initiation when using Xultophy as compared to using liraglutide alone.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Xultophy were sustained up to 52 weeks of treatment. The reduction in \nHbA1c from baseline to 52 weeks was 1.84% with Xultophy with an estimated treatment difference of \n-0.65% compared to liraglutide (p<0.0001) and -0.46% compared to insulin degludec (p<0.0001). \nBody weight was reduced by 0.4 kg with an estimated treatment difference between Xultophy and \ninsulin degludec of -2.80 kg (p<0.0001), and the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia remained 1.8 events \nper patient year of exposure maintaining a significant reduction in overall risk of confirmed \nhypoglycaemia compared to insulin degludec. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \nH\n\nbA\n1c\n\n (%\n) \n\nTime since Randomisation (Week) \n\nIDegLira \nIDeg \nLira \n\n \n\n \n\nR\nat\n\ne \nof\n\n h\nyp\n\nog\nly\n\nca\nem\n\nia\n (e\n\nve\nnt\n\ns \npe\n\nr P\nY\n\nE)\n \n\nHbA1c (%) at end of treatment \n\nIDegLira obs. rate \nIDegLira \nIDeg \nIDeg obs. rate \n\nThe curves are mean hypo rates from a negative binomial model with unique treatment \ntrajectories and the symbols are observed hypo rates vs. mean HbA1c by quartiles.  \n\nIDegLira=Xultophy, IDeg=insulin degludec, Lira=liraglutide, obs. rate=observed rate, PYE=patient year of exposure \n \nFigure 1 Mean HbA1c (%) by treatment week (left) and rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia per \npatient year of exposure vs mean HbA1c (%) (right) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \ninadequately controlled on metformin alone or in combination with pioglitazone \n \nXultophy as add-on to sulfonylurea alone or in combination with metformin were studied in a 26-week \nrandomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

In both groups 66%â€“67% achieved HbA1c < 7%. Compared to baseline, there \nwas a mean reduction in body weight of 0.9 kg for Xultophy and a mean increase of 2.6 kg for patients \ntreated with a basal-bolus regimen and the estimated treatment difference was -3.57 kg [95% CI: -\n4.19; -2.95]. The percentage of patients experiencing severe or blood-glucose confirmed symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia was 19.8% in the Xultophy group and 52.6% in the basal-bolus insulin group, and the \nestimated rate ratio was 0.11 [95% CI: 0.08-0.17]. The total daily insulin dose at end of trial was \n40 units for patients treated with Xultophy and 84 units (52 units of basal insulin and 32 units of bolus \ninsulin) for patients treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen. \n \nâ€¢ Cardiovascular Safety \n \nNo cardiovascular outcomes trials have been performed with Xultophy. \n \nLiraglutide (Victoza) \nThe Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results \n(LEADER) trial, was a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. 9,340 patients were \nrandomly allocated to either liraglutide (4,668) or placebo (4,672), both in addition to standards of \ncare for HbA1c and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Primary outcome or vital status at end of trial was \navailable for 99.7% and 99.6% of participants randomised to liraglutide and placebo, respectively. The \nduration of observation was minimum 3.5 years and up to a maximum of 5 years. The study \npopulation included patients â‰¥65 years (n=4,329) and â‰¥75 years (n=836) and patients with mild \n(n=3,907), moderate (n=1,934) or severe (n=224) renal impairment. The mean age was 64 years and \nthe mean BMI was 32.5 kg/mÂ². The mean duration of diabetes was 12.8 years. \n \nThe primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of any major adverse \ncardiovascular events (MACE): CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. \nLiraglutide was superior in preventing MACE vs placebo (Figure 6).  \n \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n    Hazard Ratio (95% CI) Liraglutide N (%) Placebo N (%) \n\nFAS: full analysis set \nCI: confidence interval  \nMACE: major adverse cardiovascular event \n%: proportion in percent of subjects with an event \nN: number of subjects \n\n \n\nFavours Liraglutide Favours Placebo \n0.7 0.8 0.9 1.1 1.2 \n\nPrimary endpoint â€“ MACE \n\nComponents of MACE: \n\n \n\nFAS \n\nCardiovascular death \n\nNon-fatal stroke \n\nNon-fatal myocardial infarction \n\nExpanded MACE \n\nAdditional components in expanded MACE: \n\nUnstable angina pectoris (hospitalisation) \n\nCoronary revascularisation \n\nHeart failure (hospitalisation) \n\nOther secondary endpoints: \n\nAll cause death \n\nNon-cardiovascular death \n\n1 \n\n0.87 \n(0.78-0.97) \n\n0.78  \n(0.66-0.93) \n\n0.89  \n(0.72-1.11) \n\n0.88 \n(0.75-1.03) \n\n0.88  \n(0.81-0.96) \n\n0.98 \n(0.76-1.26) \n\n0.91 \n(0.80-1.04) \n\n0.87 \n(0.73-1.05) \n\n0.85 \n(0.74-0.97) \n\n0.95 \n(0.77-1.18) \n\n608 \n(13.0) \n\n219 \n(4.7) \n159  \n(3.4) \n281  \n(6.0) \n948  \n\n(20.3) \n\n122 \n(2.6) \n405 \n(8.7) \n218 \n(4.7) \n\n381 \n(8.2) \n162 \n(3.5) \n\n694 \n(14.9) \n\n278  \n(6.0) \n177  \n(3.8) \n317  \n(6.8) \n1062  \n(22.7) \n\n124 \n(2.7) \n441 \n(9.4) \n248 \n(5.3) \n\n447 \n(9.6) \n169 \n(3.6) \n\n4668 \n(100) 4672 (100) \n\n \n \nFigure 6 Forest plot of analyses of individual cardiovascular event types â€“ FAS population \n \nA reduction in HbA1c from baseline to month 36 was observed with liraglutide vs placebo, in addition \nto standard of care (-1.16% vs -0.77%; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.40% [-0.45; -0.34]).  \n \nInsulin degludec (Tresiba) \nDEVOTE was a randomised, double-blind, and event-driven clinical trial with a median duration of 2 \nyears comparing the cardiovascular safety of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine (100 units/mL) \nin 7,637 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk of cardiovascular events.  \nThe primary analysis was time from randomisation to first occurrence of a 3-component major adverse \ncardiovascular event (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or \nnon-fatal stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial to exclude a pre-specified risk margin \nof 1.3 for the hazard ratio (HR) of MACE comparing insulin degludec to insulin glargine. The \ncardiovascular safety of insulin degludec as compared to insulin glargine was confirmed (HR 0.91 \n[0.78; 1.06]) (Figure 7).  \n \nAt baseline, HbA1c was 8.4% in both treatment groups and after 2 years HbA1c was 7.5% both with \ninsulin degludec and insulin glargine. \n \n \n\nPrimary analysis (3-point MACE) \n\nCV Death \n\nNon-fatal Stroke \n\nNon-fatal MI \n\nAll cause death \n\n0.90 (0.65-1.23) \n\n0.85 (0.68-1.06) \n\n0.91 (0.75-1.11) \n\n0.96 (0.76-1.21) \n\n0.91 (0.78-1.06) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n71 (1.86) \n\n144 (3.77) \n\n202 (5.29) \n\n136 (3.56) \n\n325 (8.51) \n\nInsulin degludec \nN (%) \n\n79 (2.07) \n\n169 (4.43) \n\n221 (5.79) \n\n142 (3.72) \n\n356 (9.32) \n\nInsulin glargine \nN (%) \n\n0.7 0.9 1 1.1 1.3 \nFavours \n\ninsulin degludec \nFavours \n\ninsulin glargine \n\n \nN: Number of subjects with a first EAC confirmed event during trial. %: Percentage of subjects with a first EAC confirmed event relative to \nthe number of randomised subjects.

Improved insulin secretion compared to insulin \ndegludec in response to a standardised meal test was demonstrated in 260 patients with type 2 diabetes \nafter 52 weeks of treatment. No data is available beyond 52 weeks of treatment. \n \nâ€¢ Blood pressure \nIn patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone or in combination with pioglitazone, Xultophy \nreduced mean systolic blood pressure by 1.8 mmHg compared to a reduction of 0.7 mmHg with \ninsulin degludec and 2.7 mmHg with liraglutide. In patients inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea \nalone or in combination with metformin, the reduction was 3.5 mmHg with Xultophy and 3.2 mmHg \nwith placebo. The differences were not statistically significant. In three trials with patients \ninadequately controlled on basal insulin, systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5.4 mmHg with \nXultophy and 1.7 mmHg with insulin degludec, with a statistically significant estimated treatment \ndifference of -3.71 mmHg (p=0.0028), reduced by 3.7 mmHg with Xultophy vs 0.2 mmHg with \ninsulin glargine, with a statistically significant estimated treatment difference of -3.57 mmHg \n(p<0.001) and reduced by 4.5 mmHg with Xultophy vs 1.16 mmHg with insulin glargine U100 plus \ninsulin aspart, with a statistically significant estimated treatment difference of -3.70 mmHg \n(p=0.0003). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXultophy in all subsets of the paediatric population for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nOverall, the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec and liraglutide were not affected in a clinically \nrelevant manner when administered as Xultophy compared with independent injections of insulin \ndegludec and liraglutide.  \n \nThe following reflects the pharmacokinetic properties of Xultophy unless stated that the presented data \nis from administration of insulin degludec or liraglutide alone. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe overall exposure of insulin degludec was equivalent following administration of Xultophy versus \ninsulin degludec alone while the Cmax was higher by 12%. The overall exposure of liraglutide was \nequivalent following administration of Xultophy versus liraglutide alone while Cmax was lower by \n23%. The differences are considered of no clinical relevance since Xultophy is initiated and titrated \naccording to the individual patientâ€™s blood glucose targets. \n \nInsulin degludec and liraglutide exposure increased proportionally with the Xultophy dose within the \nfull dose range based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of Xultophy is consistent with once-daily dosing and steady-state \nconcentration of insulin degludec and liraglutide is reached after 2â€“3 days of daily administration. \n \nDistribution \n \nInsulin degludec and liraglutide are extensively bound to plasma proteins (>99% and >98%, \nrespectively). \n \nBiotransformation \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nInsulin degludec \nDegradation of insulin degludec is similar to that of human insulin; all metabolites formed are \ninactive. \n \nLiraglutide \nDuring 24 hours following administration of a single radiolabelled [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy \nsubjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Two minor plasma metabolites were \ndetected (â‰¤9% and â‰¤5% of total plasma radioactivity exposure). Liraglutide is metabolised in a similar \nmanner to large proteins without a specific organ having been identified as major route of elimination. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life of insulin degludec is approximately 25 hours and the half-life of liraglutide is \napproximately 13 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nAge had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Xultophy based on results from a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis including adult patients up to 83 years treated with Xultophy. \n \nGender \nGender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Xultophy based on results from a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nEthnic origin  \nEthnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Xultophy based on results \nfrom a population pharmacokinetic analysis including White, Black, Indian, Asian and Hispanic \ngroups. \n \nRenal impairment \nInsulin degludec \nThere is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec between healthy subjects and \npatients with renal impairment. \n \nLiraglutide \nLiraglutide exposure was reduced in patients with renal impairment compared to individuals with \nnormal renal function. Liraglutide exposure was lowered by 33%, 14%, 27% and 26%, in patients with \nmild (creatinine clearance, CrCl 50â€“80 mL/min), moderate (CrCl 30â€“50 mL/min), and severe (CrCl \n<30 mL/min) renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, respectively.  \nSimilarly, in a 26-week clinical trial, patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment \n(CrCl 30â€“59 mL/min) had 26% lower liraglutide exposure when compared with a separate trial \nincluding patients with type 2 diabetes with normal renal function or mild renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nInsulin degludec \nThere is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec between healthy subjects and \npatients with hepatic impairment. \n \nLiraglutide \nThe pharmacokinetics of liraglutide was evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic \nimpairment in a single-dose trial. Liraglutide exposure was decreased by 13â€“23% in patients with mild \nto moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. Exposure was significantly lower (44%) \nin patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score >9). \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n20 \n\nNo studies have been performed with Xultophy in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe non-clinical development programme for insulin degludec/liraglutide included pivotal \ncombination toxicity studies of up to 90 days duration in a single relevant species (Wistar rats) to \nsupport the clinical development programme. Local tolerance was assessed in rabbits and pigs.  \n \nNon-clinical safety data revealed no safety concern for humans based on repeated dose toxicity \nstudies. \n \nThe local tissue reactions in the two studies in rabbits and pigs, respectively, were limited to mild \ninflammatory reactions. \n \nNo studies have been conducted with the insulin degludec/liraglutide combination to evaluate \ncarcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. The following data are based upon studies with \ninsulin degludec and liraglutide individually. \n \nInsulin degludec \nNon-clinical data reveal no safety concern for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction. \nThe ratio of mitogenic relative to metabolic potency for insulin degludec is unchanged compared to \nhuman insulin. \n \nLiraglutide \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for human based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, or genotoxicity. Non-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours were seen in \n2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice. In rats, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) \nwas not observed. These tumours were not seen in monkeys treated for 20 months. These findings in \nrodents are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents \nare particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is likely to be low but cannot be completely \nexcluded. No other treatment-related tumours have been found. \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility but slightly increased \nearly embryonic deaths at the highest dose. Dosing with liraglutide during mid-gestation caused a \nreduction in maternal weight and foetal growth with equivocal effects on ribs in rats and skeletal \nvariation in the rabbit. Neonatal growth was reduced in rats while exposed to liraglutide, and persisted \nin the post-weaning period in the high dose group. It is unknown whether the reduced pup growth is \ncaused by reduced pup milk intake due to a direct GLP-1 effect or reduced maternal milk production \ndue to decreased caloric intake. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nXultophy 100 units/mL + 3.6 mg/mL solution for injection \ninsulin degludec + liraglutide \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \nâ€¢ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \nâ€¢ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \nâ€¢ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \nâ€¢ If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Xultophy is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Xultophy \n3. How to use Xultophy \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Xultophy \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xultophy is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Xultophy is used for \nXultophy is used to improve blood glucose (sugar) levels in adult patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. You have diabetes because your body: \nâ€¢ does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in your blood or \nâ€¢ is not able to use the insulin properly. \n \nHow Xultophy works  \nXultophy contains two active substances that help your body control your blood sugar:  \nâ€¢ insulin degludec â€“ a long-acting basal insulin which lowers your blood sugar levels.  \nâ€¢ liraglutide â€“ a â€˜GLP-1 analogueâ€™ that helps your body make more insulin during meals and \n\nlowers the amount of sugar made by your body.  \n \nXultophy and oral medicines for diabetes \nXultophy is used with oral medicines for diabetes (such as metformin, pioglitazone and sulfonylurea \nmedicines). It is prescribed when these medicines (used alone or with GLP-1 treatment or with basal \ninsulin) are not enough to control your blood sugar levels.  \n \nIf you use GLP-1 treatment \nYou should stop your GLP-1 treatment prior to starting on Xultophy. \n \nIf you use insulin \nYou should stop your insulin treatment prior to starting on Xultophy. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Xultophy \n \nDo not use Xultophy \nâ€¢ if you are allergic to insulin degludec or liraglutide or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\n\n\n39 \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Xultophy.  \nâ€¢ If you are also taking a sulfonylurea (such as glimepiride or glibenclamide), your doctor may \n\ntell you to lower your sulfonylurea dose depending on your blood sugar levels. \nâ€¢ Do not use Xultophy if you have type 1 diabetes mellitus or if you have â€˜ketoacidosisâ€™ (a \n\ncondition with a build-up of acid in the blood).  \nâ€¢ The use of Xultophy is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or \n\ndelayed gastric emptying (diabetic gastroparesis). \n \nBe especially aware of the following when using Xultophy: \nâ€¢ low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) â€“ if your blood sugar is low, follow the advice in section 4 \n\nâ€˜Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)â€™. \nâ€¢ high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) â€“ if your blood sugar is high, follow the advice in section 4 \n\nâ€˜High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)â€™. \nâ€¢ Ensuring you use the right medicine â€“ Always check the pen label before each injection to avoid \n\naccidentally confusing Xultophy with other products. \n \nImportant things to know before you use this medicine: \nTell your doctor if you:  \nâ€¢ have eye problems. Fast improvements in blood sugar control may make diabetic eye problems \n\nget worse for a short time. The long-term improvements in blood sugar control may ease the eye \nproblems. \n\nâ€¢ have or have had a thyroid disease.  \n \nImportant things to know while you are using this medicine: \nâ€¢ if you have a severe stomach ache which does not go away, tell your doctor â€“ this could be a \n\nsign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis).  \nâ€¢ dehydration (loss of fluids from the body) can happen if you are feeling or being sick (nausea or \n\nvomiting) or have diarrhoea â€“ it is important to drink plenty of fluids to stop dehydration.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children or adolescents. There is no experience with Xultophy in children \nand adolescents under 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Xultophy \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level â€“ this may mean your Xultophy dose has to \nchange. \n \nListed below are the most common medicines, which may affect your Xultophy treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall if you take: \nâ€¢ other medicines for diabetes (tablets or injections) \nâ€¢ sulfonamides â€“ for infections \nâ€¢ anabolic steroids â€“ such as testosterone \nâ€¢ beta-blockers â€“ for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs \n\nof low blood sugar (see section 4 â€˜Warning signs of low blood sugar â€“ these may come on \nsuddenlyâ€™) \n\nâ€¢ acetylsalicylic acid (and medicines called â€˜salicylatesâ€™) â€“ for pain and mild fever \nâ€¢ monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors â€“ for depression \nâ€¢ angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors â€“ for some heart problems or high blood \n\npressure. \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise if you take: \nâ€¢ danazol â€“ medicine affecting ovulation \nâ€¢ oral contraceptives â€“ birth control pills \nâ€¢ thyroid hormones â€“ for thyroid disease \nâ€¢ growth hormone â€“ for low levels of growth hormone  \n\n\n\n40 \n\nâ€¢ medicines called â€˜glucocorticoidsâ€™ such as cortisone â€“ for inflammation \nâ€¢ medicines called â€˜sympathomimeticsâ€™ such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or \n\nterbutaline â€“ for asthma \nâ€¢ water tablets called â€˜thiazidesâ€™ â€“ for high blood pressure or if your body is holding onto too \n\nmuch water (water retention). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide â€“ used for treatment of acromegaly (a rare illness with too much growth \nhormone). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nPioglitazone â€“ tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with long-\nstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke, who were treated with \npioglitazone and insulin, experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor straight \naway if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in \nweight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nWarfarin or other blood thinners â€“ medicines used to prevent clotting of the blood. Tell your doctor \nif you are taking warfarin or other blood thinners as you might need to have blood tests more often to \nmeasure how thick your blood is (called â€˜International Normalised Ratioâ€™ or INR test). \n \nXultophy with alcohol \nIf you drink alcohol, your need for Xultophy may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or \nfall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nDo not use Xultophy if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are \npregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. It is not known if Xultophy \naffects the baby. \n \nDo not use Xultophy if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if Xultophy passes into breast milk.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nHaving low or high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your \nblood sugar is low or high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be \ndangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: \nâ€¢ you often get low blood sugar \nâ€¢ you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Xultophy \nXultophy contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is \nessentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use Xultophy \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen \nwithout help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the Xultophy pre-filled \npen. \n \nYour doctor will tell you: \nâ€¢ how much Xultophy you will need each day \nâ€¢ when to check your blood sugar level \nâ€¢ how to adjust the dose. \n \nYour dose of Xultophy is administered as â€˜dose stepsâ€™. The dose counter on the pen shows the number \n\n\n\n41 \n\nof dose steps. \n \nDosing time \nâ€¢ Use Xultophy once each day, preferably at the same time every day. Choose a time of the day \n\nthat works best for you. \nâ€¢ If it is not possible to use Xultophy at the same time every day, it can be used at a different time \n\nof the day. Make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. \nâ€¢ You do not have to use Xultophy with a meal.  \nâ€¢ Always follow your doctorâ€™s advice for dose and dose adjustment. \nâ€¢ If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a \n\nchange in diet may alter your need for Xultophy. \n \nHow to handle Xultophy  \nXultophy is a pre-filled dial-a-dose pen. \nâ€¢ Xultophy is administered as â€˜dose stepsâ€™. The dose counter on the pen shows the number of \n\ndose steps. \nâ€¢ One dose step contains 1 unit of insulin degludec and 0.036 mg of liraglutide.  \nâ€¢ The maximum daily dose of Xultophy is 50 dose steps (50 units of insulin degludec and 1.8 mg \n\nof liraglutide). \nCarefully read the â€˜Instructions on how to useâ€™ on the other side of this leaflet and use the pen as \ndescribed.  \nAlways check the pen label before you inject your medicine to ensure that you use the correct pen. \n \nHow to inject \nBefore you use Xultophy for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject. \nâ€¢ Xultophy is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Do not inject it into a vein or \n\nmuscle. \nâ€¢ The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist \n\n(abdomen). \nâ€¢ Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing \n\nlumps and skin pitting (see section 4). \nâ€¢ Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked \n\nneedles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. \nâ€¢ Do not use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential \n\noverdose. \n \nDetailed instructions for use are on the other side of this leaflet. \n \nDo not use Xultophy: \nâ€¢ If the pen is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5). \nâ€¢ If the liquid you can see through the pen window does not look clear and colourless. \n \nUse in elderly patients (65 years old or over) \nXultophy can be used in elderly patients but if you are elderly you may need to check your blood sugar \nlevel more often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems \nIf you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk \nto your doctor about changes in your dose. \n \nIf you use more Xultophy than you should \nIf you use more Xultophy than you should, your blood sugar may get low (hypoglycaemia) or you \nmay feel or be sick (nausea or vomiting). If your blood sugar gets low, see the advice in section 4 \nâ€˜Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)â€™. \n \nIf you forget to use Xultophy \nIf you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of \n\n\n\n42 \n\n8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your \nnext regular scheduled dose, do not take a double dose. \n \nIf you stop using Xultophy \nDo not stop using Xultophy without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Xultophy this could lead \nto a very high blood sugar level, see the advice in section 4 â€˜High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)â€™. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing serious side effects may happen with this medicine: \n \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people).  \n\nIf your blood sugar level gets low you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious \nhypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you have signs of low \nblood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level straight away. See advice in â€˜Low \nblood sugar (hypoglycaemia)â€™ further down in this section.  \n\nâ€¢ Serious allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) (not known: frequency cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n\n If you have a serious allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in Xultophy, stop using \nXultophy and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: \n\n â€¢ local reactions spread to other parts of your body \n â€¢ you suddenly feel unwell with sweating \n â€¢ you have difficulty breathing \n â€¢ you get a fast heartbeat or feel dizzy. \n \nOther side effects include: \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nâ€¢ Lower appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting), diarrhoea, constipation, indigestion \n\n(dyspepsia), inflamed lining of the stomach (gastritis), stomach ache, heartburn or bloating â€“ \nthese usually go away after a few days or weeks. \n\nâ€¢ Injection site reactions. The signs may include bruising, bleeding, pain, redness, hives, swelling \nor itching â€“ these usually go away after a few days. See your doctor if they do not disappear \nafter a few weeks. Stop using Xultophy and see a doctor straight away if they become serious.  \n\nâ€¢ Increase of pancreatic enzymes, such as lipase and amylase. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nâ€¢ Hives (red bumps on your skin that are sometimes itchy). \nâ€¢ Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) such as rash, itching and swelling of the face. \nâ€¢ Dehydration (loss of fluid from the body) â€“ it is important to drink plenty of fluids to stop \n\ndehydration. \nâ€¢ Belching (eructation) and wind (flatulence). \nâ€¢ Rash. \nâ€¢ Itching. \nâ€¢ Skin changes where you give the injection (â€˜lipodystrophyâ€™) â€“ the fatty tissue under the skin \n\nmay shrink (â€˜lipoatrophyâ€™) or get thicker (â€˜lipohypertrophyâ€™). Changing the place where you \ninject each time may reduce the risk of these skin changes. If you notice these skin changes, tell \nyour doctor or nurse. If you keep injecting in the same place, these changes can become more \nsevere and affect the amount of medicine your body gets from the pen. \n\nâ€¢ Increased heart rate. \nâ€¢ Gallstones. \nâ€¢ Inflamed gallbladder. \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n\n\n43 \n\nâ€¢ Inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis). \nâ€¢ Swelling of arms or legs (peripheral oedema) â€“ when you first start using your medicine, your \n\nbody may keep more water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other \njoints. This is usually only short-lasting. \n\n \nGeneral effects from diabetes treatment \n \nâ–º Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \n \nLow blood sugar may happen if you: \nâ€¢ drink alcohol \nâ€¢ exercise more than usual \nâ€¢ eat too little or miss a meal  \nâ€¢ use too much Xultophy. \n \nWarning signs of low blood sugar â€“ these may come on suddenly \nHeadache, slurred speech, fast heartbeat, cold sweat, cool pale skin, feeling sick (nausea), feeling very \nhungry, shaking, feeling nervous or worried, unusually tired, weak and sleepy or confused, difficulty \nconcentrating, short-lasting changes in your sight. \n \nWhat to do if you get low blood sugar: \nâ€¢ Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack â€“ like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always \n\ncarry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). \nâ€¢ Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more \n\nthan once. This is because improvement in your blood sugar may not happen straight away. \nâ€¢ Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. \n\nThen carry on with your medicine as usual. \n \nWhat others need to do if you pass out:  \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets low, including the risk of passing out. \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: \nâ€¢ turn you on your side \nâ€¢ get medical help straight away \nâ€¢ not give you any food or drink â€“ because you may choke. \n \nYou may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given \nby someone who knows how to use it. \nâ€¢ If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. \nâ€¢ If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \nâ€¢ If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short- \n\nor long-lasting. It may even cause death. \n \nTalk to your doctor if: \nâ€¢ your blood sugar got so low that you passed out \nâ€¢ you have had an injection of glucagon \nâ€¢ you have had low blood sugar a few times recently. \nThis is because the dosing of your Xultophy injections, food or exercise may need to be changed. \n \nâ–º High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may happen if you: \nâ€¢ drink alcohol \nâ€¢ exercise less than usual \nâ€¢ eat more than usual \nâ€¢ get an infection or a fever \n\n\n\n44 \n\nâ€¢ have not used enough Xultophy, keep using less Xultophy than you need, forget to use \nXultophy or stop using Xultophy without talking to your doctor. \n\n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar â€“ these normally appear gradually \nFlushed, dry skin, feeling sleepy or tired, dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath, urinating more often, \nfeeling thirsty, losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called â€˜ketoacidosisâ€™. This is a build-up of acid in the \nblood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic \ncoma and eventually death. \n \nWhat to do if you get high blood sugar: \nâ€¢ Test your blood sugar level. \nâ€¢ Test your blood or urine for ketones. \nâ€¢ Get medical help straight away. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

Get help from a person with \ngood eyesight who is trained to use the Xultophy pre-filled pen. \n \nXultophy is a medicine that contains insulin degludec and liraglutide. \nXultophy is administered as â€˜dose stepsâ€™. One dose step contains 1 unit \ninsulin degludec + 0.036 mg liraglutide. \n \nYour pen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose pen. It contains 3 mL of Xultophy solution. \nIt delivers doses from:  \nâ€“ 1 dose step  \nâ€“ to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec + 1.8 mg \n\nliraglutide) \n \n\nYour pen delivers doses in increments of 1 dose step.  \nDo not do any conversion of your dose. The dose steps dialled equal the \nnumber shown in the dose counter.  \n \nYour pen is designed to be used with NovoTwist or NovoFine disposable \nneedles up to a length of 8 mm and as thin as 32G. Needles are not included in \nthe pack. \n \n\n Important information \nPay special attention to these notes as they are important for safe use of the \npen. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nXultophy pre-filled pen and \nneedle (example) \n\nPen cap Outer  \nneedle cap \n\nInner \nneedle cap \n\nNeedle \n\nPaper tab \n\nPen scale \n\nPen window \n\nPen label \n\nDose counter \nDose pointer \n\nDose \nbutton \nwith \nsmooth \nsurface \n\nDose \nselector \nDose \nbutton \n\n \n\n \n\n1 Prepare your pen with a new needle \n \nâ€¢ Check the name and coloured label of your pen, to make sure that it \n\ncontains Xultophy. \nThis is especially important if you take more than one type of injectable \nmedicine. Taking the wrong medicine could be harmful to your health. \n\nâ€¢ Pull off the pen cap. \n\n A \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nâ€¢ Check that the solution in your pen is clear and colourless. Look \nthrough the pen window. If the solution looks cloudy, do not use the \npen. \n\n B \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Take a new needle, and tear off the paper tab. \n \n\n C \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight.  D \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it \nafter the injection, to safely remove the needle from the pen. \n\n \n\n E \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it \nback on, you may accidentally stick yourself with the needle.  \nA drop of solution may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you \nmust still check the flow. \nDo not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to take your \ninjection. \n\n \n Always use a new needle for each injection. \n\nThis may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection and \ninaccurate dosing. \n\n Never use a bent or damaged needle. \n\n F \n\n \n \n\n2 Check the flow \n \nâ€¢ Turn the dose selector to select 2 dose steps. Make sure the dose \n\ncounter shows 2. \nâ€¢ The dose counter and the dose pointer show how many dose steps of \n\nXultophy you select. \n \n\n A \n\n2  \ndose steps \n\nselected \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nâ€¢ Hold the pen with the needle pointing up.  \nTap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to \nthe top. \n\n B \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. \nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \nA drop of solution should appear at the needle tip. \n\n \nA small drop may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. \nIf no drop appears, repeat steps 2A to 2C up to 6 times. If there is still \nno drop, change the needle and repeat steps 2A to 2C once more. \nIf a drop of solution still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a \nnew one. \n\n \n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you \n\ninject. This makes sure that the solution flows. \nIf no drop appears, you will not inject any medicine, even though the \ndose counter may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged \nneedle. \n\n \n It is important always to check the flow before you inject. If you do \n\nnot check the flow, you may get too little medicine, or no medicine at \nall. This may lead to high blood sugar level. \n\n \n\n C \n\n \n \n\n3 Select your dose \n \nâ€¢ Turn the dose selector to select the dose you need. \n\nThe dose counter shows the dose in dose steps. \nIf you select a wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forward or \nbackward to the correct dose. \nThe pen can dial up to a maximum of 50 dose steps. \nThe dose selector changes the number of dose steps. \nOnly the dose counter and dose pointer will show how many dose steps \nyou select per dose. \nYou can select up to 50 dose steps per dose. When your pen contains \nless than 50 dose steps, the dose counter stops at the number of dose \nsteps left. \nThe dose selector clicks differently when turned forward, backward or \npast the number of dose steps left. Do not count the pen clicks. \n\n \n Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many \n\ndose steps you have selected before injecting the medicine. \nDo not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, \nyour blood sugar level may get high or low. \nDo not use the pen scale, it only shows approximately how much \nsolution is left in your pen. \n \n\n A \n\nExamples \n\n5 \ndose steps \n\nselected \n\n24  \ndose steps \n\nselected \n \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nHow much solution is left? \n \nâ€¢ The pen scale shows you approximately how much solution is left in \n\nyour pen. \n\n A \n\nApprox. \nhow much \nsolution is \n\nleft \n \n\nâ€¢ To see precisely how much solution is left, use the dose counter: \nTurn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. \nIf it shows 50, at least 50 dose steps are left in your pen. If it shows less \nthan 50, the number shown is the number of dose steps left in your pen. \n \n\nâ€¢ If you need more medicine than what is left in your pen, you can split \nyour dose between two pens. \n \n\n Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose.  \nIf in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose \nwrongly, you will inject too little or too much medicine. This may make \nyour blood sugar level high or low. \n\n \n\n B \n\nExample \n\nDose \ncounter \n\nstopped: 42 \ndose steps \n\nleft  \n\n4 Inject your dose \n \nâ€¢ Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown \n\nyou. \nâ€¢ Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your \n\nfingers. This could interrupt the injection. \n\n A \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows 0. \nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a \nclick. \n\n B \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Keep the needle in your skin after the dose counter has returned to 0 \nand count slowly to 6. \n\nâ€¢ If the needle is removed earlier, you may see a stream of solution \ncoming from the needle tip. If so, the full dose will not be delivered, and \nyou should increase the frequency of checking your blood sugar level. \n\n C Count slowly: \n\n1-2-3-4-5-6 \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nâ€¢ Remove the needle from your skin. \nIf blood appears at the injection site, press lightly. Do not rub the area. \n \nYou may see a drop of solution at the needle tip after injecting. This is \nnormal and does not affect your dose. \n \n\n Always watch the dose counter to know how many dose steps you \ninject. Hold the dose button down until the dose counter shows 0. If the \ndose counter does not return to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, \nwhich may lead to high blood sugar level. \n \nHow to identify a blocked or damaged needle? \nâ€¢ If 0 does not appear in the dose counter after continuously \n\npressing the dose button, you may have used a blocked or \ndamaged needle. \n\nâ€¢ In this case - you have not received any medicine - even though \nthe dose counter has moved from the original dose that you have \nset. \n\nHow to handle a blocked needle? \nChange the needle as described in section 5 and repeat all steps starting \nwith section 1: Prepare your pen with a new needle. Make sure you \nselect the full dose you need. \nNever touch the dose counter when you inject. This can interrupt the \ninjection. \n\n \n\n D \n\n \n \n\n5 After your injection \n \nâ€¢ Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without \n\ntouching the needle or the outer cap. \n \n\n A \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap \ncompletely on. \n\nâ€¢ Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully as instructed by your \ndoctor or nurse. \n\n B \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the solution from \nlight. \n \nAlways dispose of the needle after each injection to ensure the use of \na sharp needle and prevent blocked needles. If the needle is blocked, \nyou will not inject any medicine. \nWhen the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed \nby your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local authorities. \n \n\n Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may \nstick yourself with the needle. \n\n Always remove the needle from your pen after each injection. \nThis may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection, leakage of \nsolution and inaccurate dosing. \n\n C \n\n \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n Further important information \n \nâ€¢ Always keep an extra pen and new needles, in case of loss or damage. \nâ€¢ Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, \n\nespecially children. \nâ€¢ Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be \n\nharmful to their health. \nâ€¢ Never share your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-\n\ninfection. \nâ€¢ Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles â€“ to \n\nprevent needle injury and cross-infection. \n \n\n \n\nCaring for your pen \n \nâ€¢ Do not leave the pen in a car or other place where it can get too hot or \n\ntoo cold. \nâ€¢ Do not store your pen at temperatures above 30Â°C. \nâ€¢ Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid. \nâ€¢ Do not wash, soak or lubricate your pen. If necessary, clean it with \n\nmild detergent on a moistened cloth. \nâ€¢ Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces.  \n If you drop it or suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the \n\nflow before you inject. \nâ€¢ Do not try to refill your pen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \nâ€¢ Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
