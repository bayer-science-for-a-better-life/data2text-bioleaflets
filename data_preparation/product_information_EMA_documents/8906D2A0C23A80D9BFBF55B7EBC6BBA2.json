NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFortacin 150 mg/ml + 50 mg/ml cutaneous spray, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains 150 mg lidocaine and 50 mg prilocaine. \nEach actuation delivers 50 microlitres which contains 7.5 mg lidocaine and 2.5 mg prilocaine. \nEach container of 6.5 ml delivers a minimum of 20 doses. \nEach container of 5 ml delivers a minimum of 12 doses. \n \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nCutaneous spray, solution \n \nColourless to light yellow solution \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFortacin is indicated for the treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 3 actuations applied to cover the glans penis. Each dose consists of a total \nof 22.5 mg lidocaine and 7.5 mg prilocaine per application (1 dose is equal to 3 actuations). \nA maximum of 3 doses can be used within 24 hours with at least 4 hours between doses.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nDosage adjustments are not required in the elderly. \n \nThere is limited data on the efficacy and safety of Fortacin in patients 65 years and over.  \n \nRenal impairment \nClinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function, however due to its \nmethod of administration and very low systemic absorption, no dosage adjustment is required. \n \nHepatic impairment \nClinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired hepatic function, however due to its \nmethod of administration and very low systemic absorption, no dosage adjustment is required. Caution \nis advised in case of severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Fortacin in the paediatric population for the indication of treatment of \nprimary premature ejaculation in adult men. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nCutaneous use. \n \nFortacin is only indicated for application to the glans penis. \nBefore initial use, the spray container should be briefly shaken and then primed by spraying it into the \nair three times. \n \nBefore each subsequent use, it should be briefly shaken and then the spray container should be \nre-primed by spraying it once. \n \nAny foreskin should be retracted from the glans penis. Once the can is held upright (valve up), 1 dose \nof Fortacin should be applied to the entire glans penis, by actuating the valve 3 times. One third of the \nglans penis should be covered with each actuation. After 5 minutes any excess spray should be wiped \noff prior to intercourse. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity of the patient or their partner to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed \nin section 6.1. \n \nPatients or their partner with a known history of sensitivity to local anaesthetics of the amide type. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAnaemia related conditions \n \nPatients or their partner with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or \nidiopathic methaemoglobinaemia are more susceptible to medicinal product-induced \nmethaemoglobinaemia (see section 4.5). \n \nAlthough the systemic availability of prilocaine by cutaneous absorption of Fortacin is low, caution \nshould be exercised in patients with anaemia, congenital or acquired methaemoglobinaemia or patients \non concomitant therapy known to produce such conditions.  \n \nInteractions \n \nPatients on anti-arrhythmic medicinal products class III (e.g. amiodarone) should be treated with \ncaution. \n \nHypersensitivities \n \nPatients allergic to paraaminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not \nshown cross sensitivity to lidocaine and/or prilocaine; however, Fortacin should be used with caution \nin patients with a history (or partner with a history) of sensitivities to medicinal products, especially if \nthe aetiologic medicinal product is uncertain. \n \nPrecautions for use \n \nCare should be taken not to allow Fortacin to come in contact with the eye, as it may cause eye \nirritation.  Also the loss of protective reflexes can permit corneal irritation and potential abrasion.  \nAbsorption of Fortacin in conjunctival tissues has not been determined. If contact with the eye occurs, \nimmediately rinse the eye with water or sodium chloride solution and protect it until sensation returns.  \n \nFortacin sprayed onto mucous membranes of the patient or their partner, such as the mouth, nose and \nthroat, or transferred onto female genitalia or anal lining, could be absorbed and temporary local \n\n\n\n4 \n\nnumbness/anaesthesia is likely to result.  This hypoaesthesia may mask normal pain sensations and, \ntherefore, increase the dangers of localised injury. \n \nFortacin sprayed onto a damaged tympanic membrane may cause ototoxicity of the middle ear. \n \nDeterioriation was observed when Fortacin was used with polyurethane-based female and male \ncondoms.   \n \nA higher rate of erectile dysfunction and male genital hypoaesthesia may be experienced when using \nFortacin with male condoms. \n \nDue to the risk of partner transfer, patients hoping to achieve conception should either avoid using \nFortacin, or, if it is essential to achieve penetration, should wash the glans penis as thoroughly as \npossible 5 minutes after applying the spray but prior to intercourse (see section 4.6). \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment \n \nPatients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolise local anaesthetics \nnormally, are at greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine (see \nsection 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMethaemoglobinaemia may be accentuated in patients already taking medicinal products known to \ninduce the condition, e.g. sulphonamides, acetanilid, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, \nmetoclopramide, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, \npamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine and quinine (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe risk of additional systemic toxicity should be considered when large doses of Fortacin are applied \nto patients already using other local anaesthetics or structurally related medicinal products, e.g. class I \nanti-arrhythmics such as mexiletine.  \n \nSpecific interaction studies with lidocaine/prilocaine and anti-arrhythmic medicinal products class III \n(e.g. amiodarone) have not been performed, but caution is advised (see also section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products that reduce the clearance of lidocaine (e.g. cimetidine or betablockers) may cause \npotentially toxic plasma concentrations when lidocaine is given intravenously in repeated high doses \nover a long time period (30 hours). \n \nIn vitro interaction studies with topical antifungal (clotrimazole, econazole, imidazole, nystatin, \nmiconazole, ketoconazole), antibacterial (clindamycin, metronidazole) and antiviral medicinal \nproducts (acyclovir), showed no effect on antimicrobial activity.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nFortacin is not indicated for use by women.  However, there may be some exposure in female partners \nof men treated with Fortacin. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / contraception in male and females \n \nPatients hoping to achieve conception should either avoid using Fortacin, or, if it is essential to \nachieve penetration, should wash the glans penis as thoroughly as possible prior to intercourse. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of lidocaine and prilocaine in pregnant women. \nAnimal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is \npreferable to avoid the use of Fortacin during pregnancy unless effective male barrier contraceptive \nmeasures are taken in order to avoid potential foetal exposure. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLidocaine and prilocaine are excreted in human milk, but at therapeutic doses of Fortacin no effects on \nthe breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated due to active substance transfer from the male patient to \nhis female partner. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of lidocaine and prilocaine on fertility in humans. A study in \nrats showed that Fortacin caused a reduction in sperm motility. This medicinal product may reduce the \npossibility of pregnancy, but should not be used as a contraceptive. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFortacin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported with the use of this medicinal product in male patients \nwere local effects of genital hypoaesthesia (4.5%) and erectile dysfunction (4.4%). These adverse \nreactions caused discontinuation of treatment in 0.2% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported with the use of this medicinal product in female partners \nwere vulvovaginal burning sensation (3.9%), and genital hypoaesthesia (1.0%). Vulvovaginal \ndiscomfort or burning sensation caused discontinuation of treatment in 0.3% of subjects. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nFrequency of the adverse reactions is defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing incidence.   \n \n \n\nAdverse drug reactions in male glans-penis-treated subjects  \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reactions \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon  Abnormal orgasm  \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon  Headache \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon  Throat irritation \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon  Skin irritation \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAdverse drug reactions in male glans-penis-treated subjects  \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reactions \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nCommon Hypoaesthesia of male genital, erectile \ndysfunction, genital burning sensation \n\nUncommon  Genital erythema, ejaculation failure, \nparaesthesia of male genital, penile pain, penis \ndisorder, pruritus genital \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon  Pyrexia \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions in female partners  \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency  Adverse Reactions \n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon  Vaginal candidiasis \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon  Headache \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon  Throat irritation \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon  Anorectal discomfort, oral parasthesia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon  Dysuria \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nCommon  Vulvovaginal burning sensation, hypoaesthesia \n\nUncommon  Vulvovaginal discomfort, vaginal pain, \nvulvovaginal pruritus \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAs Fortacin is applied topically to the glans penis the risk of overdose is low.  \n \nPrilocaine in high doses may cause an increase in the methaemoglobin level particularly in \nconjunction with methaemoglobin-inducing agents (e.g. sulphonamides). Clinically significant \nmethaemoglobinaemia should be treated with a slow intravenous injection of methylthioninium \nchloride.  \n \nShould other symptoms of systemic toxicity occur, the signs are anticipated to be similar in nature to \nthose following the administration of local anaesthetics by other routes. Local anaesthetic toxicity is \nmanifested by symptoms of nervous system excitation and, in severe cases, central nervous and \ncardiovascular depression.  \n \nSevere neurological symptoms (convulsions, CNS depression) must be treated symptomatically by \nrespiratory support and the administration of anticonvulsive medicinal products. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anaesthetics, amides, ATC code: N01BB20 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nFortacin provides topical anaesthesia to the glans penis. The active substances lidocaine and prilocaine \nblock the transmission of nerve impulses in the glans penis, reducing the sensitivity of the glans penis. \nThis is translated into a delaying of the ejaculatory latency time without adversely affecting the \nsensation of ejaculation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nClinical trials have shown Fortacin to increase the intra-vaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), \nincrease control over ejaculation and reduce the feelings of distress in patients with premature \nejaculation as measured by the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE). The medicinal product has a \nrapid onset of action and is effective within 5 minutes of application. The effectiveness of the \nmedicinal product has been demonstrated to persist on repeat use over time. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of Fortacin was demonstrated in two multi-centre, multinational, randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo controlled studies, both followed by an open-label phase. Men satisfying the \nInternational Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) criteria for premature ejaculation (PE) who had a \nbaseline IELT ≤ 1 minutes in at least 2 of the first 3 sexual encounters during screening were eligible \nto enrol. \n \nThe effectiveness of Fortacin in treating PE was assessed by measuring IELT and the co primary \nendpoints of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction, and distress using the IPE. During the 3 months \nof the double-blind treatment phase, the geometric mean IELT increased from 0.58 to 3.17 minutes in \nthe Fortacin group and from 0.56 to 0.94 minutes in the placebo group.   \n \n85.2% of subjects in the Fortacin group achieved a mean IELT of > 1 minute over the course of \n3 months of treatment with it, whereas 46.4% of the placebo subjects had a mean IELT of > 1 minute. \n66.2% of Fortacin-treated subjects and 18.8% of placebo-treated subjects achieved a mean IELT \n> 2 minutes. \n \nThe clinically significant increases in IELT were paralleled by significant differences in the IPE scores \n(p <0.0001). Adjusted mean change scores (Fortacin vs. placebo) at Month 3 were 8.2 vs. 2.2 for the \nejaculatory control score, 7.2 vs. 1.9 for the sexual satisfaction score, and 3.7 vs. 1.1 for the distress \nscore.   \n \nIn Fortacin-treated subjects, IELT and IPE scores increased at the first measured timepoint. Both IELT \nand IPE scores continued to increase slightly more throughout the remainder of the double-blind \nphase. The positive changes in IELT and IPE domain scores were maintained during the open-label \ntreatment phase.  \n \nAt each of the three monthly assessments all subjects completed a Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) \nquestionnaire relating to perceived control over ejaculation, personal distress related to ejaculation, \nsatisfaction with sexual intercourse, and interpersonal difficulty relating to ejaculation. The PEP scores \nfollowed a similar pattern of improvement to the IELT and IPE scores. For all of the three monthly \nassessments completed by the subjects, there was a significant difference between Fortacin and \nplacebo (p < 0.0001). Partners completed the PEP questionnaire at month three. There was also a \nsignificant difference over placebo in all domains for the responses from the partners (p < 0.0001).  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFortacin in all subsets of the paediatric population in primary premature ejaculation (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe plasma levels of lidocaine and prilocaine in male and female subjects were below the level \nassociated with toxicity (5,000 ng/ml). Male volunteers had maximum plasma concentrations of \nlidocaine which were less than 4% of toxic levels, and prilocaine which were less than 0.4% of toxic \nlevels, after repeat dosing. Female volunteers receiving repeated doses directly to the cervix and \nvagina of up to five times the recommended dose for the male partner, had maximum plasma levels of \nlidocaine which were less than 8% of toxic levels, and prilocaine which were less than 1% of toxic \nlevels. \n \nSystemic exposure to lidocaine and prilocaine and their metabolites (respectively 2,6-xylidine and \no-toluidine), is low following application to the glans penis in male patients and application to the \ncervix/vagina fornices in female subjects, at doses higher than recommended.  \n \nDistribution \n \nLidocaine \nThe steady-state volume of distribution is 1.1 to 2.1 L/kg after intravenous administration. Lidocaine \nis reported to be 66% bound by plasma proteins, including alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine can \ncross the blood brain barrier and the placenta and is distributed in breast milk.  \n \nPrilocaine \nFollowing intravenous administration, the steady state volume of distribution of prilocaine is 0.7 to \n4.4 L/kg. Prilocaine is reported to be 55% bound to plasma proteins, including alpha-1-acid \nglycoprotein. Prilocaine crosses the blood-brain barrier and also crosses the placenta. Prilocaine is also \ndistributed in breast milk.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nLidocaine is largely metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP 3A4) and probably to a minor \nextent in the skin. First pass metabolism is rapid and extensive and bioavailability is about 35% after \noral doses. \n \nPrilocaine is rapidly metabolised in both the liver, by cytochrome P450, and in the kidneys by \namidases. \n \nThe metabolism of lidocaine and prilocaine results in the formation of 2,6-xylidine and o-toluidine, \nrespectively, amongst other metabolites. Plasma levels of these metabolites detected after \nadministration of Fortacin in clinical trials were low in both male and female subjects, even after doses \nof it many times in excess of the clinical dose were applied. No 2,6-xylidine or o-toluidine was \ndetectable at any time-point in vaginal fluids following local application of the medicinal product in \nfemale volunteers. \n \nElimination \n \nLidocaine \nThe terminal elimination half-life of lidocaine from the plasma following intravenous administration is \napproximately 65 - 150 minutes and the systemic clearance is 10 - 20 mL/min/kg. Lidocaine is \nexcreted in the urine mainly as metabolites, with only a small proportion excreted unchanged.   \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nPrilocaine \nThe elimination half-life of prilocaine following intravenous administration is approximately \n10 - 150 minutes. The systemic clearance is 18 - 64 mL/min/kg. Prilocaine is excreted in the urine \nmainly as its metabolites, with only a small proportion excreted unchanged.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nLidocaine \nNo teratogenic effects were observed in studies of embryonic/foetal development in rats and rabbits \nreceiving doses during organogenesis. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at doses toxic to the \nmother. The postnatal survival time of the offspring of rats treated during pregnancy and lactation with \na dose toxic to the mother was shown to be reduced. \n \nPrilocaine \nIn a study of pregnant rats receiving a combination of lidocaine and prilocaine during organogenesis, \nno effects on embryonic/foetal development were observed. There are however no systemic exposure \ndata available for comparison with clinical exposure. \n \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \n \nLidocaine \nLidocaine was not genotoxic and the carcinogenic potential of lidocaine has not been studied. The \nlidocaine metabolite 2,6-xylidine has genotoxic potential in vitro. In a carcinogenicity study of rats \nexposed to 2,6-xylidine in utero, postnatally and throughout their lifetime, tumours in the nasal cavity, \nsubcutaneous tumours and liver tumours were observed. The clinical relevance of tumour findings in \nrelation to short-term/intermittent use of lidocaine in humans is unknown. Human exposure from \nFortacin is 20-30 fold less than the minimum dose that did not result in tumours and 200 fold less than \nthe minimum dose that did result in tumours. \n \nPrilocaine \nPrilocaine was not genotoxic and the carcinogenic potential of prilocaine has not been studied. The \nprilocaine metabolite o-toluidine has genotoxic potential in vitro. In carcinogenicity studies of \no-toluidine in rats, mice and hamsters, tumours were observed in several organs. The clinical relevance \nof tumour findings in respect of short-term/intermittent use of prilocaine in humans is unknown. \nHuman exposure is 1000 fold less than than the minimum dose studied. Note, this dose did result in \ntumours.   \n  \nEffect on fertility \n \nIn an in vitro study of rats Fortacin has shown a reduction in sperm motility when 22.5 mg lidocaine \nand 7.5 mg prilocaine (i.e. the amount in 1 human dose) was in direct contact with rat sperm. However \nthis study did not reproduce the circumstances of clinical use, as the concentration of Fortacin in direct \ncontact with the sperm would be many fold lower. The potential for reduction of sperm motility \nfollowing the clinical use of the medicinal product can not be excluded; therefore it is not possible to \nstate whether Fortacin would prevent pregnancy. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nFortacin 150 mg/ml + 50 mg/ml cutaneous spray, solution \nlidocaine/prilocaine \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Fortacin is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Fortacin \n3. How to use Fortacin \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fortacin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fortacin is and what it is used for \n \nFortacin is a combination of two medicines: lidocaine and prilocaine. These belong to a group of \nmedicines called local anaesthetics. \n \nFortacin is indicated for the treatment of lifelong premature ejaculation in adult men. It works by \ndecreasing the sensitivity of the head of the penis to increase time before ejaculation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fortacin \n \nDo not use Fortacin \n- if you or your sexual partner are allergic to lidocaine or prilocaine or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); \n- if you or your sexual partner have a history of allergy or sensitivity to other local anaesthetics \n\nwith a similar structure (known as amide-type local anaesthetics). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Fortacin \n- if you, or your sexual partner, have been diagnosed with a genetic disease or other condition \n\naffecting your red blood cells (glucose-6-phosphate deficiency, anaemia or \nmethaemoglobinaemia); \n\n- if you have a history of medicine sensitivities, especially if you are not certain which medicine \ncauses sensitivity; \n\n- if you suffer from severe liver problems. \n \nWhen you use this medicine, particularly during priming of the container, aim the container away \nfrom the face to avoid accidental contact with ears, eyes, nose and mouth. \n \nIf some medicine accidentally gets into your eyes or your partner’s eyes, rinse them immediately with \ncold water or saline solution and cover them gently until any effects, such as numbness, wear off. Be \naware that normal protective mechanisms, such as blinking, or sensation of a foreign body in the eye, \nmay not occur until the numbness has worn off. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nFortacin may also come into contact with other mucous membranes such as your, or your partner’s, \nmouth, nose and throat, causing them to feel slightly numb for a short while.  As this will reduce the \nability to feel pain in these areas, extra care should be taken not to injure them until the numbness has \nworn off. \n \nDuring sexual intercourse, a small amount of this medicine may be transferred e.g. to the vagina or the \nanus. Therefore, both partners may feel slight numbness for a short while and should take care not to \ninjure themselves, particularly during sexual activity.   \n \nFortacin should not come into contact with a damaged ear drum.   \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children or adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Fortacin \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is particularly important if you are taking the following medicines which may interact \nwith Fortacin: \n \n\n• other local anaesthetics \n• heart medicines (anti-arrhythmic medicines) \n• medicines for high blood pressure and to regulate your heart rhythm (so-called beta blockers) \n• medicines reducing your stomach acid (cimetidine)  \n\n \nThe risk of a disorder reducing the amount of oxygen in the blood (methaemoglobinaemia) may be \nincreased if you are already taking medicines known to cause the condition, such as those listed \nbelow: \n\n• Benzocaine – a local anaesthetic used to treat pain and itching \n• Chloroquine, pamaquine, primaquine, quinine - used to treat malaria  \n• Metoclopramide – used to treat feelings of sickness (nausea) and vomiting, including in patients \n\nwith migraine \n• Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, nitroglycerin), isosorbide mononitrate, erythrityl tetranitrate, \n\npentaerythritol tetranitrate and other nitrate and nitrite medicines - used to treat angina (chest \npain caused by the heart) \n\n• Sodium nitroprusside, isosorbide dinitrate – used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure \n• Nitrofurantoin – an antibiotic used to treat urinary and kidney infections \n• Sulphonamides (also called sulpha medicines) e.g. sulfamethoxazole – an antibiotic used to treat \n\nurinary infections, and sulfasalazine – used to treat Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and \nrheumatoid arthritis \n\n• Dapsone – used to treat skin conditions such as leprosy and dermatitis and also to prevent \nmalaria and pneumonia in high-risk patients \n\n• Phenobarbital, phenytoin – used to treat epilepsy \n• Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) – used to treat tuberculosis \n\n \nThe risk of methaemoglobinaemia can also be increased by the use of certain dyes (aniline dyes), or \nthe pesticide naphthalene, so let your doctor know if you work with any dyes or chemical pesticides. \n \nAny barrier contraceptives (e.g. male or female condom), which are made from polyurethane-based \nmaterial cannot be guaranteed to protect against disease or pregnancy when you are also using \nFortacin. Check the material that your contraceptive or your partner’s contraceptive is made of. Ask \nyour pharmacist if you are unsure. \n \nIf you use Fortacin with condoms, you may be more likely to be unable to develop or maintain an \nerection. You may also be more likely to have reduced feeling in and around the penis. \n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nFortacin is not approved for use by women.  \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nFortacin is not recommended for use whilst your partner is pregnant unless you use a male condom, as \nlisted above, to prevent exposure of the unborn child. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThis medicine may be used while your partner is breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nFortacin may reduce the possibility of pregnancy, but is not a reliable contraceptive. Therefore, \npatients hoping to achieve conception should either avoid using Fortacin, or, if this medicine is \nessential to achieve penetration, should wash the penis as thoroughly as possible five minutes after \nFortacin has been applied, but prior to intercourse. \n \n \n3. How to use Fortacin \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose of Fortacin is 3 sprays (3 sprays = 1 dose) on the head of the penis before \nsexual intercourse.  A maximum of 3 doses can be used within 24 hours with at least 4 hours between \ndoses. \n \nInstructions for use \nBefore initial use, briefly shake the spray container and then prime the pump mechanism by spraying \nthe valve three times into the air. Aim the container away from faces to avoid contact with eyes, nose, \nmouth and ears. \nBefore each subsequent dose, briefly shake the spray container and then re-prime the pump by \nspraying 1 time into the air. \nRetract any foreskin from the head of the penis. Holding the can upright (valve up), apply 1 dose \n(3 sprays) of Fortacin to the entire head of the penis, by covering one third with each spray. Wait \n5 minutes then wipe off any excess spray prior to having sexual intercourse.  \n \nIf you use more Fortacin than you should \nAs this medicine is applied to the surface of the head of the penis the risk of overdose is low.  If you \ndo apply too much, wipe it off. \n \nSymptoms of using too much Fortacin are listed below. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you \nexperience any of these. They are very unlikely to happen if it is used as instructed: \n\n• Feeling light-headed or dizzy \n• Tingling of the skin around the mouth and numbness of the tongue \n• Abnormal taste \n• Blurred vision \n• Ringing in the ears \n• There is also a risk of a disorder reducing the amount of oxygen in the blood \n\n(methaemoglobinaemia). This is more likely when certain medicines have been taken at the same \ntime. If this happens, the skin becomes bluish-grey due to a lack of oxygen. \n\n \nIn serious cases of overdose, symptoms may include fits, low blood pressure, slowed \nbreathing, stopped breathing and altered heart beat. These effects may be life-threatening. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported with Fortacin in male patients: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n \n\n• Inability to develop or maintain an erection \n• reduced feeling in and around the penis \n• feeling of burning in and around the penis \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n \n\n• headache \n• local irritation of the throat (if inhaled)  \n• irritation of the skin \n• redness on and around the penis \n• failure to ejaculate during sexual intercourse \n• abnormal orgasm \n• tingling in and around the penis \n• pain or discomfort in and around the penis \n• itching in and around the penis \n• a high temperature \n\n \nThe following side effects have been reported with Fortacin in female partners: \n \nCommon: (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n \n\n• feeling of burning in and around the vagina \n• reduced feeling in and around the vagina \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n \n\n• headache \n• local irritation of the throat (if inhaled) \n• vaginal thrush (Candida) infection \n• discomfort in the anus and rectum \n• loss of feeling in the mouth \n• difficulty or pain passing urine \n• pain in the vagina \n• discomfort or itching in the vulva and vagina \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you or your sexual partner get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national \nreporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more \ninformation on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24 \n\n5. How to store Fortacin \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the spray container label and the \ncarton after “EXP”.
