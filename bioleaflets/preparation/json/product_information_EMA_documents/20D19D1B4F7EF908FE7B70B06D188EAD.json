NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n  \nGlybera 3 × 1012 genome copies/ml solution for injection  \n  \n  \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n  \n2.1 General description  \n  \nAlipogene tiparvovec contains the human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene variant LPLS447X in a vector. \nThe vector comprises a protein shell derived from adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1), the \nCytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element \nand AAV2 derived inverted terminal repeats. Alipogene tiparvovec is produced using insect cells and \nrecombinant baculovirus technology.  \n  \n  \n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition  \n  \nEach vial of alipogene tiparvovec contains 1 extractable ml of solution, containing 3 x 1012 genome \ncopies (gc).  \n  \nEach patient-specific pack contains a sufficient amount of vials to dose each patient with 1 x 1012 \nLPLS447X gc/kg bodyweight.  \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nThis medicinal product contains 47.5 mg sodium per administration at 27 injection sites to 105.6 mg \nsodium per administration at 60 injection sites.  \n  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.   \n  \n  \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n  \nSolution for injection.  \nClear, to slightly opalescent, colourless solution.  \n  \n  \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n  \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n  \nGlybera is indicated for adult patients diagnosed with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) \nand suffering from severe or multiple pancreatitis attacks despite dietary fat restrictions. The diagnosis \nof LPLD has to be confirmed by genetic testing. The indication is restricted to patients with detectable \nlevels of LPL protein (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nGlybera should only be used when the diagnosis of LPLD has been confirmed by an adequate genetic \ntest (see section 5.1). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nGlybera therapy must be prescribed by and administered under the supervision of a physician with \nexpertise in treating LPLD patients and in gene therapy administration, in full consultation with the \npatient. During administration of Glybera appropriate medical treatment and supervision should \nalways be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration.  \n \nPosology  \nThe maximum total dose of Glybera for administration is 1 x 1012 gc/kg body weight.  \n  \nGlybera is authorised for single treatment only. No data on re-administration of Glybera are available, \ntherefore Glybera should not be re-administered. \n  \nGlybera is administered as a one-time series of intramuscular injections in the legs. The dose per \ninjection site is 1.5 x 1012 gc, or 0.5 ml of solution for injection. For each injection site, one syringe of \n1 ml with clear volume marks of 0.5 ml must be used. Volumes per injection site must not exceed 0.5 \nml. Syringes must not be used more than once.  \n \nThe treatment should be monitored by measuring neutralising antibodies and T-Cell response against \nAAV1 and LPLS447X and T-Cell response at baseline as well as 6 and 12 months after treatment. \n \nTo calculate the number of vials, the patient’s weight is determined to the nearest whole kg. The \npatient’s weight should be divided by 3, and rounded up to the next higher whole number. This is the \nnumber of vials that must be dispensed.   \n \nTo calculate the number of injection sites and the number of syringes, the patient’s weight is \ndetermined to the nearest whole kg. The patient’s weight should be divided by 3, then without \nrounding up this number multiplied by 2 and rounded up to the next higher whole number. This is the \nnumber of injection sites and the total number of syringes (each filled with 0.5ml) required for the \npatient’s treatment. \n \nExamples of typical dose schedules based on the body weight of patients are shown in the table below:  \n  \n\nBody weight \n(kg)  \n\nNumber of vials (1 mL)  Number of 1 ml \nsyringes (each filled) \n\nwith 0.5 ml) \n\nNumber of injection \nsites  \n\n40  14  27  27  \n50  17  34  34  \n60  20  40 40  \n65  22  44  44  \n70  24 47 47  \n75  25  50 50  \n80  27  54 54  \n90  30  60 60  \n\n  \nFrom three days prior to and for 12 weeks following Glybera administration an immunosuppressive \nregimen should be administered: ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (2 x 1 g/day) is \nrecommended.  \nIn addition, half an hour prior to Glybera injection an intravenous bolus of 1mg/kg of \nmethylprednisolone should be administered (see section 4.4). \n  \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Glybera in children and adolescents below 18 years has not been \nestablished. No data are available.  \n  \nElderly  \nThere is limited experience in the use of Glybera in elderly subjects. No dose adjustment of Glybera is \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nnecessary in the elderly population.  \nDose of immunosuppressant may need to be adjusted. \n \nRenal impairment or hepatic impairment  \nThere is limited experience in the use of Glybera in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  \nNo dose adjustment of Glybera is required. \n  \nMethod of administration  \nUpon intramuscular injection, the patient will receive multiple injections of 0.5 ml (one injection per \nsyringe), distributed over the muscles of both upper and lower legs, under aseptic conditions such as \niodine. \n \nSpinal or regional anaesthesia is advised prior to intramuscular administration, due to the number of \ninjections required. In case of contraindication for such procedure deep sedation is advised instead.  \n  \nGlybera should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly (see section 4.4). \n \nTo ensure intramuscular injection, ultrasound or electrophysiological guidance of injections is advised.  \n  \nThe instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6.  \n  \n4.3 Contraindications  \n  \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients of Glybera listed in section \n6.1. \n\n \n• Immunodeficiency \n\n \n• Patients with increased bleeding risk (such as thrombocytopenia) and muscle disease (such as \n\nmyositis), must not be treated in view of the large number of intramuscular injections \nrequired. \n \n\n• Anti-platelet or other anti-coagulant medicinal products must not be used concomitantly with \nGlybera at the time of injection and for at least one week before or one day after the injection. \n\n \n• Oral contraceptive use (see section 4.6).  \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n  \nThis medicinal product contains genetically-modified organisms. Local biosafety guidelines applicable \nfor such products should be followed (see section 6.6).  \n  \nGlybera should only be administered to patients with an LPL protein mass of at least 5% of normal. \nLPL protein mass should be determined by ELISA or equivalent methods. LPL protein mass should be \nmeasured in a blood sample from the patient against a control sample from healthy volunteers. \n \nDiet  \nTreatment with Glybera does not eliminate attacks of acute pancreatitis. Patients are advised to \ncontinue to follow a low-fat diet and refrain from alcohol consumption.  \n  \nDiabetic patients  \nLimited data are available in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus is common in patients who have the \nmost severe symptoms of LPLD. The opportunity to treat diabetic patients suffering from LPLD \nshould be carefully considered by the physician. \n  \nImmunosuppressants (see section 5.2) \nImmediately prior to initiation of the immunosuppressant regimen and prior to Glybera injection the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\npatient must be checked for symptoms of active infectious disease of any nature, and in case of such \ninfection the start of treatment must be postponed until after the patient has recovered.  \n  \nThromboembolic events \nLPLD involves a state of hyperviscosity/hypercoagulability. Spinal anaesthesia and multiple \nintramuscular injections may further increase the risk of (thrombo) embolic events at and shortly after \nadministration of Glybera. Assessment of each individual subject’s risk profile prior to Glybera \nadministration is advised. Follow applicable local or international guidelines for prophylaxis (See also \nsection 4.5).  \n  \nCell and tissue donation  \nTreated patients should not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation. This \ninformation is also provided in the Glybera Patient’s Alert Card.  \n \nSerum creatine kinase \nRecipients of Glybera may display a rise in serum creatine kinase activity that becomes evident about \n2 weeks after administration, peaks at around 8 weeks and then returns to baseline by week 26. One \npatient developed myoglobinuria in association with raised serum creatine kinase activity. \n \nMuscle biopsies obtained up to 52 weeks after administration of Glybera show an infiltrate of \nlymphocytes and macrophages. The long term consequences of this cellular infiltration are not known. \n \nSodium content and potassium content \nThis medicinal product contains 47.5 mg sodium per administration at 27 injection sites to 105.6 mg \nsodium per administration at 60 injection sites. To be taken into consideration by patients on a \ncontrolled sodium diet.  \nThe product contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) potassium per administration of 27-60 injection sites ; \ni.e. essentially potassium-free. \n  \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n  \nNo interaction studies other than preclinical and clinical studies with mycophenolate mofetil and \nciclosporin have been performed.  \n  \nAnti-platelet or other anti-coagulant medicinal products must not be used concomitantly with Glybera \nat the time of injection. Correction of bleeding parameters should be instituted prior to Glybera \nadministration. Anti-platelet or other anti-coagulant medicinal products must not be taken for at least \none week before the leg injections or one day after the injection (see section 4.3).  \n \nOral contraceptive use is contraindicated in LPLD patients (see section 4.3) as this may exacerbate the \nunderlying disease. \n  \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n  \nContraception in males and females  \nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to use reliable barrier contraception methods in \naccordance with the guidelines for immunosuppressants for a minimum of 12 months from the start of \ntherapy (9 months following cessation of immunosuppressants). Therefore, use of barrier \ncontraception methods for at least 12 months following Glybera administration is recommended. \n \nOral contraceptive use is contraindicated in LPLD patients (see section 4.3) as this may exacerbate the \nunderlying disease.  \n   \nMale patients, including vasectomised males, are advised to practise barrier contraception methods for \nat least 12 months following Glybera administration.  \n  \nPregnancy  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nVery limited data on pregnancies exposed to Glybera is available. Animal studies do not indicate any \nharmful effects on pregnancy or embryonal/foetal development from Glybera (see section 5.3).  \nGlybera should not be administered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit to the mother \noutweighs the possible risk to the foetus.  \n  \nBreast-feeding  \nIt is not known whether Glybera is excreted in human milk. Glybera should not be administered to \nwomen who are breast-feeding as long as breastfeeding is ongoing.  \n  \nFertility  \nNo clinical data on the effect of Glybera on fertility are available. Effects on male and female fertility \nhave not been evaluated in animal studies.  \n  \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n  \nGlybera has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines¸ dizziness was commonly \nobserved after Glybera administration (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing dizziness are advised to \nnot drive or use machines. \n  \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n  \nSummary of the safety profile  \nThe most commonly reported adverse reaction is pain in extremity occurring in approximately one \nthird of patients.  One patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism 7 weeks after therapy. Given \nthe small patient population and size of the cohorts, captured adverse reactions and serious adverse \nreactions do not provide a complete perspective on the nature and frequency of these events.   \n \n  \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. Very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n  \n \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class  \n\nVery common  Common  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders  \n\n  Decreased appetite  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\nHeadache Burning sensation, Dizziness, Formication, \nPresyncope  \n\nVascular disorders    Hypertension  \nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders  \n\n  Dyspnoea exertional, Pulmonary embolism  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\n  Abdominal pain.Nausea, Constipation  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders  \n\n  Hair growth abnormal, Palmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia syndrome, Rash  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders  \n\nPain in extremity  Arthritis, Limb discomfort, Muscle spasms, Muscle \nstrain, Musculoskeletal stiffness, Myalgia, Muscle \npain, Neck pain, Sensation of heaviness, Acute \nmyositis and chronic myositis  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions   \n\nFatigue, \nHyperthermia  \n\nChills, Injection site pain, Oedema peripheral, \nPyrexia  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nInvestigations Elevations in serum \ncreatine kinase \nactivity \n\n \n\nInjury, poisoning, and \nprocedural \ncomplications  \n\nContusion Injection site discomfort, Injection site oedema, \nInjection site pruritus  \n\n  \n \nImmunogenicity  \nAn immune response was seen despite the use of immunosuppressants. \nIn clinical trials with Glybera, antibodies against the adeno-associated virus (AAV) protein shell were \npresent prior to treatment, in 18 out of 27 subjects; anti-AAV antibodies appeared or increased after \nGlybera administration, in all of the subjects. The clinical relevance of the antibody response is \nunknown (see section 4.2 on re-administration). \nNo neutralising assay was used.  \n  \nT-cell responses against AAV were detected in approximately half of the subjects post therapy only. \nNo T-cell response to LPL was detected in any subject.  \n \nWith the exception of a case of fever (39.9 °C) in study CT-AMT-011-01 which reversed within a day, \nno Glybera or immunosuppression related serious adverse events occurred. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n  \n4.9 Overdose  \n  \nPre-clinical studies with doses ten times the recommended dose (1 x 1013 gc/kg) did not lead to any \ngeneral systemic untoward signs or symptoms. Symptomatic and supportive treatment, as deemed \nnecessary by the treating physician, is advised in case of overdose.  \nIn the event two doses are administered by mistake to the identical injection site this might lead to \nmore local reaction such as bruising or sensitivity.  \nLocal pain or sensitivity may be managed by symptomatic treatment such as administration of local or \nsystemic pain relievers.  \n  \n  \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n  \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n  \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Lipid modifying agents, other lipid modifying agents, ATC code: \nC10AX10.  \n  \nMechanism of action  \nGlybera contains the human LPL gene variant LPL S447X in an adeno-associated virus serotype 1 \n(AAV1) vector intended to target the muscle. Glybera is injected as a one-time series into the muscle \nof the lower extremities where it is taken up by myocytes. The elements of the vector were chosen \nsuch that expression of the LPL S447X gene is promoted, by co-opting the expression machinery of the \ncell and the myocytes produce the protein product of the transgene LPL S447X without the vector being \nable to reproduce itself. \n  \nPharmacodynamic effects  \nLipoprotein lipase is a key ‘first step’ enzyme in the metabolism of lipoproteins following fat intake \nwith diet. In clinical studies a transient reduction in triglycerides for up to 12 weeks in individual \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n \n\npatients could be observed. Furthermore, Glybera allows expression of the LPL protein in injected \nmuscle which is reflected by the improvement of postprandial chylomicron (CM) metabolism \nobserved in a small subset of patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Glybera has been evaluated in three interventional clinical studies \nwith AAV1-LPLS447X in LPLD subjects. \n  \nTwo of these clinical trials were preceded by prospective observational studies to assess fasting \ntriglycerides (TG) level and symptoms and signs of LPLD in subjects maintained on a low fat diet. \nStrict compliance with dietary fat restriction was difficult.  \n  \nStandard genetic analysis (sequencing) was used in the clinical studies of Glybera.  An appropriate CE \nmarked test or full gene sequencing should be used to confirm the diagnosis. \n \nClinical trial CT-AMT-010-01  \nAAV1-LPLS447X was administered to 8 LPLD patients in a 12-week, open label dose escalating study \n(1 x 1011 gc to 3 x 1011 gc per kg body weight i.m.). No drug-related serious adverse events occurred \nand no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. In half of the subjects a T-cell response to the vector was \nseen. Compared to pre-administration, a transient and variable reduction in median triglyceride levels \nwas recorded for all patients.  \n  \nClinical trial CT-AMT-011-01  \nThe aim of this open label, dose escalating study was to assess the safety profile and reduction of \nfasting plasma triglyceride (TG) levels after 12 weeks post Glybera administration in 14 LPLD \npatients. All patients were controlled on low fat diets in the 12-week main study period. The first 2 \npatients enrolled received a dose of 3 x 1011 gc/kg, the next 4 patients received a dose of 3 x 1011 gc/kg \nwith immunosuppressant regiment (oral ciclosporin and oral mycophenolate mofetil from the day after \nGlybera administration until Week 12) and the final 8 patients received a dose of 1 x 1012gc/kg with \nimmunosuppressant regiment. T-cell responses were seen in roughly half of the patients without \nclinical sequelae. From the triglyceride data the 1 x 1012 gc/kg dose appears the most optimal.  \n  \nClinical trial CT-AMT-011-02  \nThis is an open-label study of alipogene tiparvovec at a fixed dose of 1x1012 gc/ kg body weight \nadministered by a single series of intramuscular injections. Five eligible subjects were included in the \nstudy with all subjects receiving alipogene tiparvovec. Subjects also received a daily oral dose of 3 \nmg/kg/day cyclosporine and 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil starting three days before \nadministration of alipogene tiparvovec through week 12. A single intravenous bolus of \nmethylprednisolone (1 mg/kg bodyweight) was given 30 minutes prior to alipogene tiparvovec \nadministration. One patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism 7 weeks after therapy. A \ntransient reduction of triglycerides for up to 12 weeks in some individual patients has been observed. \nAfter this time, triglyceride levels reverted back to baseline. A demonstrable improvement of \npostprandial CM metabolism was shown in 5/5 patients up to week 14 and in 3/3 patients who were \nfollowed up to 52 weeks. \n  \nAll interventional studies continued into long term follow up studies. The patients in CT-AMT-010-01 \nhave been followed for up to 5 years (n=6) post therapy administration, those in CT-AMT-011-01 for \nup to 5 years (n=13), and those in CT-AMT-011-02 for up to 1 year (n=3).  \n  \nMuscle biopsies taken half a year post administration demonstrated long-term expression of the LPL \ngene and the presence of biologically active LPL protein.  \n \nClinical trial CT-AMT-11-03 \nStudy CT-AMT-011-03 was a combined retrospective and prospective study of subjects who had \ntaken part in studies CT-AMT-10-01, CT-AMT-11-01, CT-AMT-11-02.  \nIn a follow-up period of up to 3 years after treatment, there was a decreasing trend in the incidence and \nseverity of pancreatitis in the 12 patients who had multiple attacks during their life time.   \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nClinical trial CT-AMT-11-05 \nFurther follow-up of patients who took part in study CT-AMT-11-03 (to a median of 5.8 years after \nexposure to Glybera) has shown a reduction in hospital stay of 1 day per patient per year when \ncompared to the same length of time prior to exposure. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nGlybera in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n  \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become \navailable every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.  \n  \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n  \nGlybera is expected to be degraded by endogenous protein and DNA catabolic pathways.  \n  \nNon-clinical biodistribution  \nFollowing intramuscular administration of Glybera to mice, vector DNA was transiently detected in \nthe circulation. Eight days after administration, high levels of vector DNA sequence were detected in \ninjected muscle and the draining lymph nodes. Except for the site of injection, the highest vector DNA \ncopy numbers were found in the liver and blood. The lowest number of copies was found in the brain, \nlung, heart and non-injected groups of muscle. In gonads and reproductive organs, vector DNA copies \nwere found at low levels. After time, residual vector DNA levels remained high in the injected muscle \nand inguinal lymph nodes while decreasing steadily in the other organs. The levels of Glybera vector \nDNA found in gonads were measurable but lower than in other non-target organs.  \nImmunosuppressant co-treatment did not influence the biodistribution pattern neither at low dose nor \nat high dose in mice. The biodistribution pattern was very similar in the other tested species (cats and \nrabbits).   \n  \nClinical pharmacokinetics and shedding  \nShedding was assessed in the clinical studies by collecting saliva, urine and semen. In CT-AMT-011-\n02 faeces was also collected. After administration of Glybera to the participants, the highest vector \nDNA concentrations were detected in the serum, with clearance by one to two logs per week.  \n  \nIn saliva vector DNA was still detectable up to 12 weeks; in urine up to 10 weeks and in semen up to \n26 weeks. All but two patients received immunosuppressant for 12 weeks. There is the theoretical risk \nthat the co-administration of the immunosuppressant regime leads to longer persistence of virus DNA \nin serum and as well to longer shedding in saliva, urine and semen.  \n  \nHigh levels of vector DNA were observed up to 12 months after dosing in the target tissue for \nGlybera, injected leg muscle, but not in non-injected muscle.  \n  \nPharmacokinetics in special populations e.g. elderly/renal impairment etc.   \nGlybera is injected directly into the target organ, skeletal muscle. Liver and kidney function, \ncytochrome P450 polymorphisms and ageing are not expected to influence the clinical efficacy or \nsafety of Glybera.  \n  \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n  \nUpon injection, Glybera was well tolerated in all animal studies performed with no notable clinical \nsigns. In mice local cellular infiltrates and signs of degeneration and regeneration without necrosis, \nwere seen at the clinical dose in the injected muscle upon histopathological examination. These effects \nwere dose-dependent but showed regression with time. As expected, all animals developed antibodies \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nto the AAV protein shell.  \n  \nUpon treatment four weeks prior to mating, no maternal, foetal and developmental toxicity was seen in \nmice. No vector DNA could be detected in the foetuses after treatment of either the females or the \nmales prior to mating.  \n  \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. However in toxicity studies, no increase in tumour \nwas identified. Although there is no fully adequate animal model to address the tumourigenic \npotential, the available toxicological data do not suggest any concern for tumourigenicity \n  \n  \n6.

The final outer carton contains a variable number of casings according to the patient \nspecific dose required.  \n  \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling  \n \nInstructions for preparation and handling and disposal  \nRefer to local biosafety guidelines applicable for handling and disposal of medicinal products \ncontaining genetically-modified organisms.  \n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nWork surfaces and material which have potentially been in contact with Glybera must be \ndecontaminated with appropriate virucidal disinfectants with activity for non-enveloped viruses (such \nas hypochlorite and chlorine releasers) for at least 10 minutes.  \n  \nPreparation of Glybera for administration  \nAfter the amount of Glybera to be administered has been calculated (see section 4.2) remove the \ncorrect number of single use vials from the freezer to thaw at room temperature (15oC to 25oC), \napproximately 30-45 minutes in advance of syringe filling.  \nAfter thawing, each vial should be gently inverted twice to ensure even mixing. Vials should be \nvisually inspected for particulate matter and colour. The clear to slightly opalescent and colourless \nsolution must be free of visible particles. Only clear and colourless solutions without visible particles \nshould be used. If a vial is showing damage, syringes for the injection should not be prepared and the \ninjection procedure should be postponed and rescheduled. The Marketing Authorisation Holder should \nbe informed immediately.  \n  \nGlybera is delivered in a patient-specific pack and will therefore contain the precise amount of vials \nper patient, calculated according to the patient’s weight.  \n  \nThe calculated amount of syringes should be filled from the thawed vials, and they should be labelled \nand placed in a container protected from light suitable for transportation to the room where the patient \nwill undergo the intramuscular injections.  \n  \nTo avoid any injection of particles from the stopper due to two withdrawals, one needle for the \nwithdrawal from the vial (to be left inside the stopper) and a separate needle for each syringe must be \nused. \n  \n7.

Possible side effects \n5. How to store Glybera \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n1. What Glybera is and what it is used for \n \nGlybera contains alipogene tiparvovec, a gene therapy product that works by delivering a gene into the \nbody to correct a genetic deficiency. It belongs to a group of medicines called lipid modifying agents. \n \nGlybera is used to treat a specific inherited condition known as “lipoprotein lipase deficiency \n(LPLD)”.  \n \nLipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a naturally occurring substance in the body (known as an enzyme) that \ncontrols the level of certain fats in the blood. In lipoprotein lipase deficiency, this enzyme is missing \ndue to a genetic defect. People who are affected by this condition have a build up of very high fat \nlevels in their blood (hyperchylomicronemia).  \n \nGlybera is used to treat adult patients diagnosed with lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) and \nsuffering from severe or multiple pancreatitis attacks despite dietary fat restrictions. The diagnosis of \nLPLD has to be confirmed by genetic testing. Glybera will only be given to you if you show \ndetectable levels of LPL protein in your blood.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Glybera \n \nDo not receive Glybera  \n\n- if you are allergic to alipogene tiparvovec or to any of the other ingredients of Glybera (listed \nin section 6 ‘Further information’).  \n\n- if your immune system does not work properly \n- if you have an increased bleeding risk and or muscle disease  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n- if you are taking oral contraceptives \n \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure of any of the above, please talk to your doctor \nbefore you receive Glybera.  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n• It is important that you fully understand the benefits and risks associated with the \ntreatment by discussing with your doctor  \n\n• It is important that you tell your doctor if you have an active infection of any sort before you \ntake the medicines you will be given to reduce your body’s defences (immunosuppressants) \nand before you receive Glybera. See also section 3, ‘How Glybera is used’. \n\n• Glybera is a gene therapy product. It contains genetically modified organisms. After treatment \nwith Glybera do not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation to avoid \nspreading cells that contain your medicine. \n\n• Tell your doctor if you are suffering from diabetes. \n• You should continue to follow a fat-restricted, alcohol-free diet. People diagnosed with \n\nlipoprotein lipase deficiency are advised to be careful with their diet, both before and after \nGlybera therapy; they should restrict their intake of ‘normal diet fats’ and should not drink \nalcohol. \n\n \nAdditional monitoring tests \nSmall amounts of blood will be drawn before treatment, 6 months and 12 months after treatment to \nmeasure how your body’s immune (defence) system is responding to the treatment with Glybera. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nGlybera is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Glybera \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking the \nfollowing before you are given Glybera: \n\n• A medicine impacting blood coagulation e.g. acetylsalicylic acid (e.g.aspirin), a substance \npresent in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever, as well as medicines used to \nprevent blood clotting eg anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin. These medicines should \nnot be taken for at least one week before the leg injections or one day after you have had the \ninjections. Taking these medicines before receiving or at the same time as receiving Glybera, \nmay cause unnecessary bruising or bleeding from the injection sites. \n\n• Oral contraceptives (see section 2 ‘Do not receive Glybera’) \n \nGlybera with alcohol \nPeople diagnosed with lipoprotein lipase deficiency are advised to be careful with their diet, both \nbefore and after Glybera therapy; they should not drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using any medicine. \n \nGlybera is not usually recommended for use during pregnancy. There is very limited information \nabout the safety of Glybera in pregnant women. \n\n• It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are \nplanning to get pregnant. Your doctor will weigh up the benefits to you against the risks to \nyour baby of taking Glybera whilst you are pregnant. \n\n• Use appropriate barrier contraception such as condoms to avoid becoming pregnant during \ntreatment and for at least 12 months after treatment. Do not take oral contraceptives as they \nhave the potential to worsen your disease; Use condoms so that as little Glybera as possible \nmay be passed to/from your partner. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n• If you do become pregnant during treatment with Glybera, tell your doctor. \n \n\nIt is not known whether Glybera passes into breast milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended during \ntreatment with Glybera.   \n \nMale patients must use condoms for at least 12 months after injection with Glybera.  Using condoms \nwill reduce the amount of Glybera that may be left in the woman’s body.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nDizziness was commonly observed after Glybera administration. You should consider this when \ndriving or using machines. Talk to your doctor about this. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Glybera \nGlybera contains sodium and potassium. The amount of sodium and potassium that you may receive \ndepends on the number of injections that you need; your doctor will work this out depending on your \nweight. \nYou need to take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \nThis medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per administration at 27 injection sites to \n60 injection sites, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. \n \n \n3. How Glybera is given to you \n \nGlybera therapy will be overseen by a doctor who is specialised in the treatment of patients affected \nby your condition and will be administered to you by an appropriately qualified and trained doctor or \nnurse.  \n \nGlybera will be given to you in a single therapy administration session in a hospital. At this time a \nseries of injections (27 to 60 injections) into the muscles of both upper and lower legs will be given. \nThe dose you will need is dependent on your weight and is calculated by your doctor.   \n \nDue to the large number of individual injections that you will receive during the Glybera therapy \nsession, you will be given either a regional anaesthetic into the spine (which will numb your legs \nonly), or a more localised anaesthetic before you are given the Glybera injections. Your doctor will \ntalk to you about the anaesthetic and how it will be given.  \n \nAfter you have been given Glybera, you may notice that your legs have a yellow colour; this might \noccur in case iodine was used to clean (sterilise) your legs before you received the medicine. This will \nfade after a short time. You will need to stay in hospital for a few hours or overnight to make sure that \nyou have not had any side effects from the medicine or the anaesthetic. \n \nGlybera should be administered to you in one treatment session only. Re-administration of Glybera \nafter this first treatment session is not recommended.  \n \nIt is important that at the time of first Glybera administration, your body’s immune (defence) system is \nnot activated. To avoid this, your doctor will also prescribe treatment that will suppress the immune \nsystem (known as immunosuppressants), starting 3 days before the day of injection with Glybera and \nfor 12 weeks after. Examples of these immunosuppressants are ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil. In \naddition methylprednisolone might be administered half an hour prior to the Glybera administration. It \nis important that you take these medicines according to the instructions given. Do not stop taking these \nwithout talking to your doctor. \n \nPlease ask your doctor for more information about the exact immunosuppressant medicine you will be \ntaking. \n \nIf you receive more Glybera than you should \nAs this medicine is given to you by a doctor, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. If you \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nreceive two doses in one injection site by mistake this might lead to more local reaction such as \nbruising or sensitivity. Your doctor will treat this appropriately.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Glybera can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nVery common (may affects more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n• pain in leg(s) (pain in extremity) \n• raised body temperature  \n• tiredness (fatigue) \n• headache \n• bruises in the upper and lower leg muscle due to the injections. They only last a short time. \n• Increased blood level of the muscle enzyme creatine kinase   \n\n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n• abdominal pain \n• nausea \n• constipation \n• chills \n• fever \n• muscle pain and joint aches, pains and stiffness \n• difficulty breathing, chest pain on breathing in and palpitations which may be caused by \n\nblockage of the main blood vessel  of the lung  \n• burning sensation \n• high blood pressure  \n• sensation like that of insects crawling on (or under) the skin  \n• water retention  \n• decreased appetite \n• dizziness \n• skin rash \n• muscle spasms \n• light headedness \n• hair growth \n• injection site discomfort, swelling, rash and pain \n\n \n \nSide effects from your immunosuppressants \nIn addition to being given Glybera, you will be given other medicines called immunosuppressants (see \nsection 3 ‘How Glybera is used’). It is important that you ask your doctor about the side effects of \nthese other medicines. Your doctor should give you a copy of the patient information leaflet (like this \none) for the immunosuppressants you will need to take. Do not stop taking these without talking to \nyour doctor. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.

During administration of Glybera appropriate medical treatment and supervision should \nalways be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration.  \n \nPosology  \nThe maximum total dose of Glybera for administration is 1 x 1012 gc/kg body weight.  \n  \nGlybera is authorised for single treatment only. No data on re-administration of Glybera are available, \ntherefore Glybera should not be re-administered. \n  \nGlybera is administered as a one-time series of intramuscular injections in the legs. The dose per \ninjection site is 1.5 x 1012 gc, or 0.5 ml of solution for injection.  For each injection site, one syringe of \n1 ml with clear volume marks of 0.5 ml must be used. Volumes per injection site must not exceed \n0.5ml. Syringes must not be used more than once.  \n  \nThe treatment should be monitored by measuring neutralising antibodies and T-Cell response against \nAAV1 and LPLS447X at baseline as well as 6 and 12 months after treatment. \n \nGlybera should only be used when the diagnosis of LPLD has been confirmed by an adequate genetic \ntest. \n \nTo calculate the number of vials, the patient’s weight is determined to the nearest whole kg. The \npatient’s weight should be divided by 3, and rounded up to the next higher whole number. This is the \nnumber of vials that must be dispensed.   \n \nTo calculate the number of injection sites and the number of syringes, the patient’s weight is \ndetermined to the nearest whole kg. The patient’s weight should be divided by 3, then without \nrounding up this number multiplied by 2 and rounded up to the next higher whole number. This is the \nnumber of injection sites and the total number of syringes (each filled with 0.5ml) needed to \nadminister a volume of 0.5ml per injection site for the patient’s treatment. \n \nExamples of typical dose schedules based on the body weight of patients are shown in the table below:  \n  \n\nBody weight \n(kg)  \n\nNumber of vials (1 mL)  Number of 1ml syringes \n(each filled with 0.5ml) \n\nNumber of injection \nsites  \n\n40  14  27  27  \n50  17  34  34  \n60  20  40 40  \n65  22  44  44  \n70  24 47 47  \n75  25  50 50  \n80  27  54 54  \n90  30  60 60  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n34 \n \n\n  \nFrom three days prior to and for 12 weeks following Glybera administration an immunosuppressive \nregimen should be administered: ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (2 x 1 g/day) is \nrecommended.  \nIn addition, half an hour prior to Glybera injection an intravenous bolus of 1mg/kg of \nmethylprednisolone should be administered. \n  \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Glybera in children and adolescents below 18 years has not been \nestablished. No data are available.  \n  \nElderly  \nThere is limited experience in the use of Glybera in elderly subjects. No dose adjustment of Glybera is \nnecessary in the elderly population.  \nDose of immunosuppressant may need to be adjusted. \n  \nRenal impairment or hepatic impairment  \nThere is limited experience in the use of Glybera in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. \nNo dose adjustment of Glybera is required. \n  \nMethod of administration  \nUpon intramuscular injection, the patient will receive multiple injections of 0.5 ml (one injection per \nsyringe), distributed over the muscles of both upper and lower legs, under aseptic conditions such as \niodine. \n \nSpinal or regional anaesthesia is advised prior to intramuscular administration, due to the number of \ninjections required. In case of contraindication for such procedure deep sedation is advised instead.  \n  \nGlybera should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nTo ensure intramuscular injection, ultrasound or electrophysiologic guidance of injections is advised.  \n \nInstructions for use, handling and disposal \nRefer to local biosafety guidelines applicable for handling and disposal of medicinal products \ncontaining genetically-modified organisms. \n \nWork surfaces and material which have potentially been in contact with Glybera must be \ndecontaminated with appropriate virucidal disinfectants with activity for non-enveloped viruses (such \nas hypochlorite and chlorine releasers) for at least 10 minutes. \n \nPreparation of Glybera for administration  \nAfter the amount of Glybera to be administered has been calculated (see section posology)  remove the \ncorrect number of single use vials from the freezer to thaw at room temperature (15oC to 25oC), \napproximately 30-45 minutes in advance of syringe filling.  \n \nAfter thawing, each vial should be gently inverted twice to ensure even mixing. Vials should be \nvisually inspected for particulate matter and colour. The clear to slightly opalescent and colourless \nsolution must be free of visible particles. Only clear and colourless solutions without visible particles \nshould be used. If a vial is showing damage, syringes for the injection should not be prepared and the \ninjection procedure should be postponed and rescheduled. The Marketing Authorisation Holder should \nbe informed immediately. \n \nGlybera is delivered in a patient-specific pack and will therefore contain the precise amount of vials \nper patient, calculated according to the patient’s weight.  \n \nThe calculated amount of syringes should be filled from the thawed vials, and they should be labelled \nand placed in a container protected from light suitable for transportation to the room where the patient \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nwill undergo the intramuscular injections.  \n \nTo avoid any injection of particles from the stopper due to two withdrawals, one needle for the \nwithdrawal from the vial (to be left inside the stopper) and a separate needle for each syringe must be \nused. \n \n \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
