NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRotarix powder and solvent for oral suspension \nRotavirus vaccine, live \n \n \n2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAfter reconstitution, 1 dose (1 ml) contains: \n \nHuman rotavirus RIX4414 strain (live, attenuated)* not less than 106.0 CCID50 \n \n*Produced on Vero cells \n \nExcipients with known effect: \nThis product contains sucrose 9 mg and sorbitol 13.5 mg (see section 4.4). \n  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for oral suspension. \nThe powder is white. \nThe solvent is a turbid liquid with a slow settling white deposit and a colourless supernatant. \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nRotarix is indicated for the active immunisation of infants aged 6 to 24 weeks for prevention of gastro-\nenteritis due to rotavirus infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe use of Rotarix should be based on official recommendations. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose may be administered from the age of 6 \nweeks. There should be an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses. The vaccination course should \npreferably be given before 16 weeks of age, but must be completed by the age of 24 weeks. \n \nRotarix may be given with the same posology to preterm infants born after at least 27 weeks of \ngestational age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nIn clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such \ncircumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits \nout or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same \nvaccination visit. \n \nIt is recommended that infants who receive a first dose of Rotarix complete the 2-dose regimen with \nRotarix. There are no data on safety, immunogenicity or efficacy when Rotarix is administered for the \nfirst dose and another rotavirus vaccine is administered for the second dose or vice versa. \n \n\n\n\n  3 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nRotarix should not be used in children over 24 weeks of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRotarix is for oral use only. \n \nRotarix should under no circumstances be injected. \n\n \nFor instructions for the preparation or reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, \nsee section 6.6. \n\n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of rotavirus vaccines. \n \nHistory of intussusception. \n \nSubjects with uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose \nfor intussusception. \n \nSubjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder (see section 4.8). \n \nAdministration of Rotarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile \nillness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contra-indication for immunisation. \n \nThe administration of Rotarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from diarrhoea or vomiting. \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIt is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history \nespecially with regard to the contraindications and by a clinical examination. \n \nThere are no data on the safety and efficacy of Rotarix in infants with gastrointestinal illnesses or \ngrowth retardation. Administration of Rotarix may be considered with caution in such infants when, in \nthe opinion of the physician, withholding the vaccine entails a greater risk. \n \nAs a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative of \nintussusception (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and/or \nhigh fever) since data from observational safety studies indicate an increased risk of intussusception, \nmostly within 7 days after rotavirus vaccination (see section 4.8). Parents/guardians should be advised \nto promptly report such symptoms to their healthcare provider. \n \nFor subjects with a predisposition for intussusception, see section 4.3. \n \nAsymptomatic and mildly symptomatic HIV infections are not expected to affect the safety or efficacy \nof Rotarix. A clinical study in a limited number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV positive \ninfants showed no apparent safety problems (see section 4.8). \nAdministration of Rotarix to infants who have known or suspected immunodeficiency, including in \nutero exposure to an immunosuppressive treatment, should be based on careful consideration of \npotential benefits and risks. \n \nExcretion of the vaccine virus in the stools is known to occur after vaccination with peak excretion \naround the 7th day. Viral antigen particles detected by ELISA were found in 50% of stools after the \n\n\n\n  4 \n\nfirst dose and 4% of stools after the second dose. When these stools were tested for the presence of \nlive vaccine strain, only 17% were positive. \n \nCases of transmission of this excreted vaccine virus to seronegative contacts of vaccinees have been \nobserved without causing any clinical symptom. \n \nRotarix should be administered with caution to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts, \nsuch as individuals with malignancies, or who are otherwise immunocompromised or individuals \nreceiving immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nContacts of recent vaccinees should observe personal hygiene (e.g. wash their hands after changing \nchild\u2019s nappies). \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \u2264 28 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \n \nAs the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or \ndelayed. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nThe extent of protection that Rotarix might provide against other rotavirus strains that have not been \ncirculating in clinical trials is currently unknown. Clinical studies from which efficacy data were \nderived were conducted in Europe, Central and South America, Africa and Asia (see section 5.1). \n \nRotarix does not protect against gastro-enteritis due to other pathogens than rotavirus. \n \nNo data are available on the use of Rotarix for post-exposure prophylaxis. \n \nRotarix should under no circumstances be injected. \n \nThe vaccine contains sucrose and sorbitol as excipients. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \nfructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not \ntake this vaccine. \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nRotarix can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines \n[including hexavalent vaccines (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib)]: diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis \nvaccine (DTPw), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa), Haemophilus influenzae \ntype b vaccine (Hib), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine and meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine. Clinical studies demonstrated \nthat the immune responses and the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected. \n \nConcomitant administration of Rotarix and oral polio vaccine (OPV) does not affect the immune \nresponse to the polio antigens. Although concomitant administration of OPV may slightly reduce the \nimmune response to rotavirus vaccine, clinical protection against severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis was \nshown to be maintained in a clinical trial involving more than 4,200 subjects who received Rotarix \nconcomitantly with OPV. \n \nThere are no restrictions on the infant\u2019s consumption of food or liquid, either before or after \n\n\n\n  5 \n\nvaccination. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nRotarix is not intended for use in adults. There are no data on the use of Rotarix during pregnancy and \nlactation.  \n \nBased on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against \nrotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the \nvaccination schedule. \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety profile presented below is based on data from clinical trials conducted with either the \nlyophilised or the liquid formulation of Rotarix. \nIn a total of four clinical trials, approximately 3,800 doses of Rotarix liquid formulation were \nadministered to approximately 1,900 infants. Those trials have shown that the safety profile of the \nliquid formulation is comparable to the lyophilised formulation. \n \nIn a total of twenty-three clinical trials, approximately 106,000 doses of Rotarix (lyophilised or liquid \nformulation) were administered to approximately 51,000 infants.  \n \nIn three placebo-controlled clinical trials (Finland, India and Bangladesh), in which Rotarix was \nadministered alone (administration of routine paediatric vaccines was staggered), the incidence and \nseverity of the solicited events (collected 8 days post-vaccination), diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of \nappetite, fever, irritability and cough/runny nose were not significantly different in the group receiving \nRotarix when compared to the group receiving placebo. No increase in the incidence or severity of \nthese events was seen with the second dose. \n \nIn a pooled analysis from seventeen placebo-controlled clinical trials (Europe, North America, Latin \nAmerica, Asia, Africa) including trials in which Rotarix was co-administered with routine paediatric \nvaccines (see section 4.5), the following adverse reactions (collected 31 days post-vaccination) were \nconsidered as possibly related to vaccination. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Diarrhoea \n\n Uncommon  Abdominal pain, flatulence \n\n Very rare Intussusception (see section 4.4) \n\n\n\n  6 \n\n Not known* Haematochezia \n\n Not known* Gastroenteritis with vaccine viral \nshedding in infants with Severe \nCombined Immunodeficiency \n(SCID) disorder \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Dermatitis \n\nVery rare Urticaria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Irritability \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nNot known* Apnoea in very premature infants \n(\u2264 28 weeks of gestation) (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n* Because these events were reported spontaneously, it is not possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIntussusception \n \nData from observational safety studies performed in several countries indicate that rotavirus vaccines \ncarry an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 6 additional \ncases per 100,000 infants have been observed in these countries against a background incidence of 25 \nto 101 per 100,000 infants (less than one year of age) per year, respectively.  \nThere is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose.  \nIt remains unclear whether rotavirus vaccines affect the overall incidence of intussusception based on \nlonger periods of follow-up (see section 4.4). \n \nOther special populations  \n \nSafety in preterm infants \n \nIn a clinical study, 670 pre-term infants from 27 to 36 weeks of gestational age were administered \nRotarix and 339 received placebo. The first dose was administered from 6 weeks after birth. Serious \nadverse events were observed in 5.1% of recipients of Rotarix as compared with 6.8% of placebo \nrecipients. Similar rates of other adverse events were observed in Rotarix and placebo recipients. No \ncases of intussusception were reported. \n \nSafety in infants with human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection \n \nIn a clinical study, 100 infants with HIV infection were administered Rotarix or placebo. The safety \nprofile was similar between Rotarix and placebo recipients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nSome cases of overdose have been reported. In general, the adverse event profile reported in these \ncases was similar to that observed after administration of the recommended dose of Rotarix. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n  7 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: rotavirus diarrhoea vaccines, ATC code: J07BH01 \n \nProtective efficacy \n \nIn clinical trials, efficacy was demonstrated against gastro-enteritis due to rotavirus of the most \ncommon genotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and G9P[8]. In addition, efficacy against \nuncommon rotavirus genotypes G8P[4](severe gastro-enteritis) and G12P[6] (any gastro-enteritis) has \nbeen demonstrated. These strains are circulating worldwide. \n \nClinical studies have been conducted in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia to evaluate the \nprotective efficacy of Rotarix against any and severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis. \n \nSeverity of gastro-enteritis was defined according to two different criteria: \n- the Vesikari 20-point scale, which evaluates the full clinical picture of rotavirus gastro-enteritis by \n\ntaking into account the severity and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting, the severity of fever and \ndehydration as well as the need for treatment \n\nor \n- the clinical case definition based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria \n \nClinical protection was assessed in the ATP cohort for efficacy, which includes all subjects from the \nATP cohort for safety who entered into the concerned efficacy follow-up period. \n \nProtective efficacy in Europe \n \nA clinical study performed in Europe evaluated Rotarix given according to different European \nschedules (2, 3 months; 2, 4 months; 3, 4 months; 3, 5 months) in 4,000 subjects.  \n \nAfter two doses of Rotarix, the protective vaccine efficacy observed during the first and second year \nof life is presented in the following table: \n \n\n 1st year of life \nRotarix N=2,572  \nPlacebo N=1,302  \n\n2nd year of life \nRotarix N=2,554  \nPlacebo N=1,294  \n\nVaccine efficacy (%) against any and severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis \n[95% CI] \n\nGenotype Any severity Severe\u2020 Any severity Severe\u2020 \nG1P[8] 95.6 \n\n[87.9;98.8] \n96.4 \n\n[85.7;99.6] \n82.7 \n\n[67.8;91.3] \n96.5 \n\n[86.2;99.6] \nG2P[4] 62.0* \n\n[<0.0;94.4] \n74.7* \n\n[<0.0;99.6] \n57.1 \n\n[<0.0;82.6] \n89.9 \n\n[9.4;99.8] \nG3P[8] 89.9 \n\n[9.5;99.8] \n100 \n\n[44.8;100] \n79.7 \n\n[<0.0;98.1] \n83.1* \n\n[<0.0;99.7] \nG4P[8] 88.3 \n\n[57.5;97.9] \n100 \n\n[64.9;100] \n69.6* \n\n[<0.0;95.3] \n87.3 \n\n[<0.0;99.7] \nG9P[8] 75.6 \n\n[51.1;88.5] \n94.7 \n\n[77.9;99.4] \n70.5 \n\n[50.7;82.8] \n76.8 \n\n[50.8;89.7] \nStrains with P[8] \n\ngenotype \n88.2 \n\n[80.8;93.0] \n96.5 \n\n[90.6;99.1] \n75.7 \n\n[65.0;83.4] \n87.5 \n\n[77.8;93.4] \nCirculating \n\nrotavirus strains \n87.1 \n\n[79.6;92.1] \n95.8 \n\n[89.6;98.7] \n71.9 \n\n[61.2;79.8] \n85.6 \n\n[75.8;91.9] \nVaccine efficacy (%) against rotavirus gastro-enteritis requiring medical \n\nattention \n\n\n\n  8 \n\n[95% CI] \nCirculating \n\nrotavirus strains \n91.8 \n\n[84;96.3] \n76.2 \n\n[63.0;85.0] \nVaccine efficacy (%) against hospitalisation due to rotavirus gastro-enteritis \n\n[95% CI] \nCirculating \n\nrotavirus strains \n100 \n\n[81.8;100] \n92.2 \n\n[65.6;99.1] \n\u2020 Severe gastro-enteritis was defined as a score \u226511 on the Vesikari scale \n* Not statistically significant (p \u2265 0.05).

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (1.5 ml) contains: \n \nHuman rotavirus RIX4414 strain (live, attenuated)* not less than 106.0 CCID50 \n \n*Produced on Vero cells \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nThis product contains sucrose 1,073 mg (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral suspension. \nRotarix is a clear and colourless liquid. \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nRotarix is indicated for the active immunisation of infants aged 6 to 24 weeks for prevention of gastro-\nenteritis due to rotavirus infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe use of Rotarix should be based on official recommendations. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose may be administered from the age of 6 \nweeks. There should be an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses. The vaccination course should \npreferably be given before 16 weeks of age, but must be completed by the age of 24 weeks. \n \nRotarix may be given with the same posology to preterm infants born after at least 27 weeks of \ngestational age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nIn clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such \ncircumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits \nout or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same \nvaccination visit. \n \nIt is recommended that infants who receive a first dose of Rotarix complete the 2-dose regimen with \nRotarix. There are no data on safety, immunogenicity or efficacy when Rotarix is administered for the \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nfirst dose and another rotavirus vaccine is administered for the second dose or vice versa. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nRotarix should not be used in children over 24 weeks of age.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRotarix is for oral use only. \n \nRotarix should under no circumstances be injected. \n \nFor instructions for administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of rotavirus vaccines. \n \nHistory of intussusception. \n \nSubjects with uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose \nfor intussusception. \n \nSubjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder (see section 4.8). \n \nAdministration of Rotarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile \nillness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contra-indication for immunisation. \n \nThe administration of Rotarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from diarrhoea or vomiting. \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIt is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history \nespecially with regard to the contraindications and by a clinical examination. \n \nThere are no data on the safety and efficacy of Rotarix in infants with gastrointestinal illnesses or \ngrowth retardation. Administration of Rotarix may be considered with caution in such infants when, in \nthe opinion of the physician, withholding the vaccine entails a greater risk. \n \nAs a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative of \nintussusception (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and/or \nhigh fever) since data from observational safety studies indicate an increased risk of intussusception, \nmostly within 7 days after rotavirus vaccination (see section 4.8). Parents/guardians should be advised \nto promptly report such symptoms to their healthcare provider. \n \nFor subjects with a predisposition for intussusception, see section 4.3. \n \nAsymptomatic and mildly symptomatic HIV infections are not expected to affect the safety or efficacy \nof Rotarix. A clinical study in a limited number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV positive \ninfants showed no apparent safety problems (see section 4.8). \nAdministration of Rotarix to infants who have known or suspected immunodeficiency, including in \nutero exposure to an immunosuppressive treatment, should be based on careful consideration of \npotential benefits and risks. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\nExcretion of the vaccine virus in the stools is known to occur after vaccination with peak excretion \naround the 7th day. Viral antigen particles detected by ELISA were found in 50% of stools after the \nfirst dose of Rotarix lyophilised formulation and 4% of stools after the second dose. When these stools \nwere tested for the presence of live vaccine strain, only 17% were positive. In two comparative \ncontrolled trials, vaccine shedding after vaccination with Rotarix liquid formulation was comparable \nto that observed after vaccination with Rotarix lyophilised formulation. \n \nCases of transmission of this excreted vaccine virus to seronegative contacts of vaccinees have been \nobserved without causing any clinical symptom. \n \nRotarix should be administered with caution to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts, \nsuch as individuals with malignancies, or who are otherwise immunocompromised or individuals \nreceiving immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nContacts of recent vaccinees should observe personal hygiene (e.g. wash their hands after changing \nchild\u2019s nappies). \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \u2264 28 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \n \nAs the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or \ndelayed. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nThe extent of protection that Rotarix might provide against other rotavirus strains that have not been \ncirculating in clinical trials is currently unknown.  Clinical studies from which efficacy data were \nderived were conducted in Europe, Central and South America, Africa and Asia (see section 5.1).  \n \nRotarix does not protect against gastro-enteritis due to other pathogens than rotavirus. \n \nNo data are available on the use of Rotarix for post-exposure prophylaxis. \n \nRotarix should under no circumstances be injected. \n \nThe vaccine contains sucrose as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this \nvaccine. \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nRotarix can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines \n[including hexavalent vaccines (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib)]: diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis \nvaccine (DTPw), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa), Haemophilus influenzae \ntype b vaccine (Hib), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine and meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine. Clinical studies demonstrated \nthat the immune responses and the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected. \n \nConcomitant administration of Rotarix and oral polio vaccine (OPV) does not affect the immune \nresponse to the polio antigens. Although concomitant administration of OPV may slightly reduce the \nimmune response to rotavirus vaccine, clinical protection against severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis was \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nshown to be maintained in a clinical trial involving more than 4,200 subjects who received Rotarix \nconcomitantly with OPV. \n \nThere are no restrictions on the infant\u2019s consumption of food or liquid, either before or after \nvaccination. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nRotarix is not intended for use in adults. There are no data on the use of Rotarix during pregnancy and \nlactation. \n \nBased on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against \nrotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the \nvaccination schedule. \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile presented below is based on data from clinical trials conducted with either the \nlyophilised or the liquid formulation of Rotarix. \nIn a total of four clinical trials, approximately 3,800 doses of Rotarix liquid formulation were \nadministered to approximately 1,900 infants. Those trials have shown that the safety profile of the \nliquid formulation is comparable to the lyophilised formulation. \n \nIn a total of twenty-three clinical trials, approximately 106,000 doses of Rotarix (lyophilised or liquid \nformulation) were administered to approximately 51,000 infants.  \n \nIn three placebo-controlled clinical trials (Finland, India and Bangladesh), in which Rotarix was \nadministered alone (administration of routine paediatric vaccines was staggered), the incidence and \nseverity of the solicited events (collected 8 days post-vaccination), diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of \nappetite, fever, irritability and cough/runny nose were not significantly different in the group \nreceiving Rotarix when compared to the group receiving placebo. No increase in the incidence or \nseverity of these events was seen with the second dose. \n \nIn a pooled analysis from seventeen placebo-controlled clinical trials (Europe, North America, Latin \nAmerica, Asia, Africa) including trials in which Rotarix was co-administered with routine paediatric \nvaccines (see section 4.5), the following adverse reactions (collected 31 days post-vaccination) were \nconsidered as possibly related to vaccination. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Diarrhoea \n\n Uncommon  Abdominal pain, flatulence \n\n Very rare Intussusception (see section 4.4) \n\n Not known* Haematochezia \n\n Not known* Gastroenteritis with vaccine viral \nshedding in infants with Severe \nCombined Immunodeficiency \n(SCID) disorder \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Dermatitis \n\nVery rare Urticaria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Irritability \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nNot known* Apnoea in very premature infants \n(\u2264 28 weeks of gestation) (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n* Because these events were reported spontaneously, it is not possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIntussusception \n \nData from observational safety studies performed in several countries indicate that rotavirus vaccines \ncarry an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 6 additional \ncases per 100,000 infants have been observed in these countries against a background incidence of 25 \nto 101 per 100,000 infants (less than one year of age) per year, respectively. \nThere is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose.  \nIt remains unclear whether rotavirus vaccines affect the overall incidence of intussusception based on \nlonger periods of follow-up (see section 4.4). \n \nOther special populations  \n \nSafety in preterm infants \n \nIn a clinical study, 670 pre-term infants from 27 to 36 weeks of gestational age were administered \nRotarix lyophilised formulation and 339 received placebo. The first dose was administered from 6 \nweeks after birth. Serious adverse events were observed in 5.1% of recipients of Rotarix as compared \nwith 6.8% of placebo recipients. Similar rates of other adverse events were observed in Rotarix and \nplacebo recipients. No cases of intussusception were reported. \n \nSafety in infants with human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection \n \nIn a clinical study, 100 infants with HIV infection were administered Rotarix lyophilised formulation \nor placebo. The safety profile was similar between Rotarix and placebo recipients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n4.9  Overdose \n \nSome cases of overdose have been reported. In general, the adverse event profile reported in these \ncases was similar to that observed after administration of the recommended dose of Rotarix. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: rotavirus diarrhoea vaccines, ATC code: J07BH01 \n \nProtective efficacy of the lyophilised formulation \n \nIn clinical trials, efficacy was demonstrated against gastro-enteritis due to rotavirus of the most \ncommon genotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and G9P[8]. In addition, efficacy against \nuncommon rotavirus genotypes G8P[4](severe gastro-enteritis) and G12P[6] (any gastro-enteritis) has \nbeen demonstrated. These strains are circulating worldwide. \n \nClinical studies have been conducted in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia to evaluate the \nprotective efficacy of Rotarix against any and severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis. \n \nSeverity of gastro-enteritis was defined according to two different criteria: \n- the Vesikari 20-point scale, which evaluates the full clinical picture of rotavirus gastro-enteritis by \n\ntaking into account the severity and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting, the severity of fever and \ndehydration as well as the need for treatment \n\nor \n- the clinical case definition based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria \n \nClinical protection was assessed in the ATP cohort for efficacy, which includes all subjects from the \nATP cohort for safety who entered into the concerned efficacy follow-up period. \n \nProtective efficacy in Europe \n \nA clinical study performed in Europe evaluated Rotarix given according to different European \nschedules (2, 3 months; 2, 4 months; 3, 4 months; 3, 5 months) in 4,000 subjects. \n \nAfter two doses of Rotarix, the protective vaccine efficacy observed during the first and second year \nof life is presented in the following table: \n \n\n 1st year of life \nRotarix N=2,572  \nPlacebo N=1,302  \n\n2nd year of life \nRotarix N=2,554  \nPlacebo N=1,294  \n\nVaccine efficacy (%) against any and severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis \n[95% CI] \n\nGenotype Any severity Severe\u2020 Any severity Severe\u2020 \nG1P[8] 95.6 \n\n[87.9;98.8] \n96.4 \n\n[85.7;99.6] \n82.7 \n\n[67.8;91.3] \n96.5 \n\n[86.2;99.6] \nG2P[4] 62.0* \n\n[<0.0;94.4] \n74.7* \n\n[<0.0;99.6] \n57.1 \n\n[<0.0;82.6] \n89.9 \n\n[9.4;99.8] \nG3P[8] 89.9 \n\n[9.5;99.8] \n100 \n\n[44.8;100] \n79.7 \n\n[<0.0;98.1] \n83.1* \n\n[<0.0;99.7] \nG4P[8] 88.3 \n\n[57.5;97.9] \n100 \n\n[64.9;100] \n69.6* \n\n[<0.0;95.3] \n87.3 \n\n[<0.0;99.7] \nG9P[8] 75.6 \n\n[51.1;88.5] \n94.7 \n\n[77.9;99.4] \n70.5 \n\n[50.7;82.8] \n76.8 \n\n[50.8;89.7] \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nStrains with P[8] \ngenotype \n\n88.2 \n[80.8;93.0] \n\n96.5 \n[90.6;99.1] \n\n75.7 \n[65.0;83.4] \n\n87.5 \n[77.8;93.4] \n\nCirculating \nrotavirus strains \n\n87.1 \n[79.6;92.1] \n\n95.8 \n[89.6;98.7] \n\n71.9 \n[61.2;79.8] \n\n85.6 \n[75.8;91.9] \n\nVaccine efficacy (%) against rotavirus gastro-enteritis requiring medical \nattention \n[95% CI] \n\nCirculating \nrotavirus strains \n\n91.8 \n[84;96.3] \n\n76.2 \n[63.0;85.0] \n\nVaccine efficacy (%) against hospitalisation due to rotavirus gastro-enteritis \n[95% CI] \n\nCirculating \nrotavirus strains \n\n100 \n[81.8;100] \n\n92.2 \n[65.6;99.1] \n\n\u2020 Severe gastro-enteritis was defined as a score \u226511 on the Vesikari scale \n* Not statistically significant (p \u22650.05).

These data should be interpreted with caution  \n# The numbers of cases, on which the estimates of efficacy against G4P[8] were based, were very \nsmall (1 case in the Rotarix group and 2 cases in the placebo group) \n \nA pooled analysis of five efficacy studies*, showed a 71.4% (95% CI: 20.1;91.1) efficacy against \nsevere rotavirus gastro-enteritis (Vesikari score \u226511) caused by rotavirus G2P[4] genotype during the \nfirst year of life. \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n* In these studies, the point estimates and confidence intervals were respectively: 100% (95% CI: -\n1,858.0;100), 100% (95% CI: 21.1;100), 45.4% (95% CI: -81.5;86.6), 74.7 (95% CI :-386.2;99.6). No \npoint estimate was available for the remaining study. \n \nProtective efficacy in Africa \n \nA clinical study performed in Africa (Rotarix: N = 2,974; placebo: N = 1,443) evaluated Rotarix given \nat approximately 10 and 14 weeks of age (2 doses) or 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age (3 doses).

These data should be interpreted with caution \n \nSustained efficacy up to 3 years of age in Asia \n \nA clinical study conducted in Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan) (Total vaccinated cohort: \nRotarix: N = 5,359; placebo: N = 5,349) evaluated Rotarix given according to different schedules (2, 4 \nmonths of age; 3, 4 months of age). \n \nDuring the first year, significantly fewer subjects in the Rotarix group reported severe rotavirus gastro-\nenteritis caused by the circulating wild-type RV compared to the placebo group from 2 weeks after \nDose 2 up to one year of age (0.0% versus 0.3%), with a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI: 72.2; \n100). \n\n \nThe protective vaccine efficacy after two doses of Rotarix observed against severe rotavirus gastro-\nenteritis up to 2 years of age is presented in the following table: \n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n Efficacy up to 2 years of age \nRotarix N= 5,263 \nPlacebo N= 5,256 \n\nVaccine efficacy (%) against severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis [95% CI] \nGenotype Severe\u2020 \n\nG1P[8] 100 [80.8;100] \nG2P[4] 100* [<0.0;100] \nG3P[8] 94.5 [64.9;99.9] \nG9P[8] 91.7 [43.8;99.8] \nStrains with P[8] genotype 95.8 [83.8;99.5] \nCirculating rotavirus strains 96.1 [85.1;99.5] \nVaccine efficacy (%) against rotavirus gastro-enteritis requiring hospitalisation \nand/or rehydration therapy in a medical facility [95% CI] \nCirculating rotavirus strains 94.2  [82.2;98.8] \n\n\u2020 Severe gastro-enteritis was defined as a score \u226511 on the Vesikari scale \n* Not statistically significant (p \u2265 0.05). These data should be interpreted with caution \n \nDuring the third year of life, there were no cases of severe RV gastro-enteritis in the Rotarix group \n(N=4,222) versus 13 (0.3%) in the placebo group (N=4,185). Vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI: \n67.5; 100). The severe RV gastro-enteritis cases were due to RV strains G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and \nG9P[8]. The incidence of severe RV gastro-enteritis associated with the individual genotypes was too \nsmall to allow calculation of efficacy. The efficacy against severe RV gastro-enteritis requiring \nhospitalisation was 100% (95% CI: 72.4; 100). \n\n \nProtective efficacy of the liquid formulation \n \nSince the immune response observed after 2 doses of Rotarix liquid formulation was comparable to \nthe immune response observed after 2 doses of Rotarix lyophilised formulation, the levels of vaccine \nefficacy observed with the lyophilised formulation can be extrapolated to the liquid formulation. \n \nImmune response \n \nThe immunologic mechanism by which Rotarix protects against rotavirus gastro-enteritis is not \ncompletely understood. A relationship between antibody responses to rotavirus vaccination and \nprotection against rotavirus gastro-enteritis has not been established.  \n \nThe following table shows the percentage of subjects initially seronegative for rotavirus (IgA antibody \ntitres < 20 U/ml) (by ELISA) with serum anti-rotavirus IgA antibody titres \u226520U/ml one to two \nmonths after the second dose of vaccine or placebo as observed in different studies with Rotarix \nlyophilised formulation. \n \nSchedule Studies \n\nconducted in \nVaccine Placebo \n\n  N % \u2265 20U/ml \n[95% CI] \n\nN % \u2265 20U/ml \n[95% CI] \n\n2, 3 months France, \nGermany \n\n239 82.8 \n[77.5;87.4] \n\n127 8.7 \n[4.4;15.0] \n\n2, 4 months Spain 186 85.5 \n[79.6;90.2] \n\n89 12.4 \n[6.3;21.0] \n\n3, 5 months Finland, Italy 180 94.4 \n[90.0;97.3] \n\n114 3.5 \n[1.0;8.7] \n\n3, 4 months Czech \nRepublic \n\n182 84.6 \n[78.5;89.5] \n\n90 2.2 \n[0.3;7.8] \n\n2, 3 to 4 \nmonths \n\nLatin \nAmerica; 11 \n\n393 77.9% \n[73.8;81.6] \n\n341 15.1% \n[11.7;19.0] \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\ncountries \n10, 14 weeks \nand 6, 10, 14 \nweeks \n(Pooled) \n\nSouth Africa, \nMalawi \n\n221 58.4 \n[51.6;64.9] \n\n111 22.5 \n[15.1;31.4] \n\n \nIn three comparative controlled trials, the immune response elicited by Rotarix liquid formulation was \ncomparable to the one elicited by Rotarix lyophilised formulation. \n \nImmune response in preterm infants \n \nIn a clinical study conducted in preterm infants, born after at least 27 weeks of gestational age, the \nimmunogenicity of Rotarix was assessed in a subset of 147 subjects and showed that Rotarix is \nimmunogenic in this population; 85.7% (95% CI: 79.0;90.9) of subjects achieved serum anti-rotavirus \nIgA antibody titres \u2265 20U/ml (by ELISA) one month after the second dose of vaccine. \n \nEffectiveness \n\nIn observational studies, vaccine effectiveness was demonstrated against severe gastro-enteritis \nleading to hospitalisation due to rotavirus of common genotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and \nG9P[8] as well as the less common rotavirus genotypes G9P[4] and G9P[6].

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nRotarix powder and solvent for oral suspension \n\nrotavirus vaccine, live \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Rotarix is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix \n3. How Rotarix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rotarix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rotarix is and what it is used for \n \nRotarix is a viral vaccine, containing live, attenuated human rotavirus, that helps to protect your child, \nfrom the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus \ninfection. \n \nHow Rotarix works \n \nRotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. \nRotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. \nMost children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill \nwith severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defences) will make \nantibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against \ndisease caused by these types of rotavirus. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the \nrotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix \n \nRotarix should not be given \n\u2022 if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other \n\ningredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy \nskin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\n\u2022 if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of \nbowel becomes enfolded within another segment). \n\n\u2022 if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. \n\u2022 if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe \n\nCombined Immunodeficiency (SCID). \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n \n\n\u2022 if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone \nthe vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but \ntalk to your doctor first. \n\n\u2022 if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination \nuntil recovery. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: \n\u2022 he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, \n\ne.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. \n\u2022 he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. \n\u2022 he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. \n\u2022 he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or \n\nif his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune \nsystem. \n\n \nAfter your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your \nchild experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or \nhigh fever (see also section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n \nAs always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. \n \nOther medicines and Rotarix \nTell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has \nrecently received any other vaccine. \n \nRotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, \nsuch as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or \ninactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C \nconjugate vaccines. \n \nRotarix with food and drink \nThere are no restrictions on your child\u2019s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after \nvaccination. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBased on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against \nrotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the \nvaccination schedule. \n \nRotarix contains sucrose and sorbitol \nIf you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, \ncontact your doctor before receiving this vaccine. \n \n \n3.

Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rotarix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rotarix is and what it is used for \n \nRotarix is a viral vaccine, containing live, attenuated human rotavirus, that helps to protect your child, \nfrom the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus \ninfection. \n \nHow Rotarix works \n \nRotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. \nRotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. \nMost children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill \nwith severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation.  \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defences) will make \nantibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against \ndisease caused by these types of rotavirus. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the \nrotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix \n \nRotarix should not be given \n\u2022 if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other \n\ningredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy \nskin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\n\u2022 if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of \nbowel becomes enfolded within another segment). \n\n\u2022 if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. \n\u2022 if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe \n\nCombined Immunodeficiency (SCID). \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n \n\n\u2022 if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone \nthe vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but \ntalk to your doctor first. \n\n\u2022 if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination \nuntil recovery. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: \n\u2022 he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, \n\ne.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. \n\u2022 he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. \n\u2022 he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. \n\u2022 he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or \n\nif his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune \nsystem. \n\n \nAfter your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your \nchild experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or \nhigh fever (see also section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n \nAs always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. \n \nOther medicines and Rotarix \nTell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has \nrecently received any other vaccine. \n \nRotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, \nsuch as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or \ninactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C \nconjugate vaccines. \n \nRotarix with food and drink \nThere are no restrictions on your child\u2019s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after \nvaccination. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBased on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against \nrotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the \nvaccination schedule. \n \nRotarix contains sucrose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, \ncontact your doctor before receiving this vaccine. \n \n \n3. How Rotarix is given \n \nThe doctor or nurse will administer the recommended dose of Rotarix to your child. The vaccine (1.5 \nml liquid) will be given orally. Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by \ninjection. \n \nYour child will receive two doses of the vaccine. Each dose will be given on a separate occasion with \nan interval of at least 4 weeks between the two doses. The first dose may be given from the age of 6 \nweeks. The two doses of the vaccine must have been given by the age of 24 weeks, although they \nshould preferably have been given before 16 weeks of age.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n \n\nRotarix may be given according to the same vaccination course to infants who were born prematurely, \nprovided that the pregnancy had lasted at least 27 weeks. \n \nIn case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be \ngiven at the same vaccination visit. \n \nWhen Rotarix is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives \nRotarix (and not another rotavirus vaccine) for the second dose.  \n \nIt is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for your child only.

Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rotarix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rotarix is and what it is used for \n \nRotarix is a viral vaccine, containing live, attenuated human rotavirus, that helps to protect your child, \nfrom the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus \ninfection. \n \nHow Rotarix works \n \nRotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. \nRotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. \nMost children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill \nwith severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation.  \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defences) will make \nantibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against \ndisease caused by these types of rotavirus. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the \nrotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix \n \nRotarix should not be given \n\u2022 if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other \n\ningredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy \nskin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\n\u2022 if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of \nbowel becomes enfolded within another segment). \n\n\u2022 if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. \n\u2022 if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe \n\nCombined Immunodeficiency (SCID). \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n \n\n\u2022 if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone \nthe vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but \ntalk to your doctor first. \n\n\u2022 if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination \nuntil recovery. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: \n\u2022 he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, \n\ne.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. \n\u2022 he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. \n\u2022 he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. \n\u2022 he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or \n\nif his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune \nsystem. \n\n \nAfter your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your \nchild experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or \nhigh fever (see also section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n \nAs always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. \n \nOther medicines and Rotarix \nTell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has \nrecently received any other vaccine. \n \nRotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, \nsuch as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or \ninactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C \nconjugate vaccines. \n \nRotarix with food and drink \nThere are no restrictions on your child\u2019s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after \nvaccination. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBased on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against \nrotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the \nvaccination schedule. \n \nRotarix contains sucrose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, \ncontact your doctor before receiving this vaccine. \n \n \n3. How Rotarix is given \n \nThe doctor or nurse will administer the recommended dose of Rotarix to your child. The vaccine (1.5 \nml liquid) will be given orally. Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by \ninjection. \n \nYour child will receive two doses of the vaccine. Each dose will be given on a separate occasion with \nan interval of at least 4 weeks between the two doses. The first dose may be given from the age of 6 \nweeks. The two doses of the vaccine must have been given by the age of 24 weeks, although they \nshould preferably have been given before 16 weeks of age.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n \n\nRotarix may be given according to the same vaccination course to infants who were born prematurely, \nprovided that the pregnancy had lasted at least 27 weeks. \n \nIn case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be \ngiven at the same vaccination visit. \n \nWhen Rotarix is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives \nRotarix (and not another rotavirus vaccine) for the second dose.  \n \nIt is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you \nforget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effects may happen with this vaccine: \n \n\u2666 Common (These may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine):  \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea   \n\u2022 irritability \n\n \n\u2666 Uncommon (These may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): \n\n\u2022 abdominal pain (see also below for signs of very rare side effects of intussusception) \n\u2022 flatulence \n\u2022 inflammation of the skin \n\n \nSide effects that have been reported during marketed use of Rotarix include: \n\n\u2022 Very rare: hives (urticaria) \n\u2022 Very rare: intussusception (part of the intestine gets blocked or twisted).  The signs may \n\ninclude severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high \nfever. Contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your child experiences \none of these symptoms. \n\n\u2022 blood in stools \n\u2022 in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal \n\nbetween breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. \n\u2022 children with a rare inherited illness called Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) \n\nmay have an inflamed stomach or gut (gastroenteritis) and pass the vaccine virus in their \nstools. The signs of gastroenteritis may include feeling sick, being sick, stomach cramps or \ndiarrhoea. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf your child gets any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rotarix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rotarix is and what it is used for \n \nRotarix is a viral vaccine, containing live, attenuated human rotavirus, that helps to protect your child, \nfrom the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus \ninfection. \n \nHow Rotarix works \n \nRotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. \nRotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. \nMost children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill \nwith severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation.  \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defences) will make \nantibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against \ndisease caused by these types of rotavirus. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the \nrotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix \n \nRotarix should not be given \n\u2022 if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other \n\ningredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy \nskin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\n\u2022 if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of \nbowel becomes enfolded within another segment). \n\n\u2022 if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. \n\u2022 if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe \n\nCombined Immunodeficiency (SCID). \n\n\n\n \n\n79 \n \n\n\u2022 if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone \nthe vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but \ntalk to your doctor first. \n\n\u2022 if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination \nuntil recovery. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: \n\u2022 he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, \n\ne.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. \n\u2022 he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. \n\u2022 he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. \n\u2022 he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or \n\nif his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune \nsystem. \n\n \nAfter your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your \nchild experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or \nhigh fever (see also section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n \nAs always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. \n \nOther medicines and Rotarix \nTell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has \nrecently received any other vaccine. \n \nRotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, \nsuch as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or \ninactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C \nconjugate vaccines. \n \nRotarix with food and drink \nThere are no restrictions on your child\u2019s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after \nvaccination. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBased on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against \nrotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the \nvaccination schedule. \n \nRotarix contains sucrose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, \ncontact your doctor before receiving this vaccine. \n \n \n3. How Rotarix is given \n \nThe doctor or nurse will administer the recommended dose of Rotarix to your child. The vaccine (1.5 \nml liquid) will be given orally. Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by \ninjection. \n \nYour child will receive two doses of the vaccine. Each dose will be given on a separate occasion with \nan interval of at least 4 weeks between the two doses. The first dose may be given from the age of 6 \nweeks. The two doses of the vaccine must have been given by the age of 24 weeks, although they \nshould preferably have been given before 16 weeks of age.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n80 \n \n\nRotarix may be given according to the same vaccination course to infants who were born prematurely, \nprovided that the pregnancy had lasted at least 27 weeks. \n \nIn case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be \ngiven at the same vaccination visit. \n \nWhen Rotarix is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives \nRotarix (and not another rotavirus vaccine) for the second dose.  \n \nIt is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you \nforget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effects may happen with this vaccine: \n \n\u2666 Common (These may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine):  \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea   \n\u2022 irritability \n\n \n\u2666 Uncommon (These may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): \n\n\u2022 abdominal pain (see also below for signs of very rare side effects of intussusception) \n\u2022 flatulence \n\u2022 inflammation of the skin \n\n \nSide effects that have been reported during marketed use of Rotarix include: \n\n\u2022 Very rare: hives (urticaria) \n\u2022 Very rare: intussusception (part of the intestine gets blocked or twisted).  The signs may \n\ninclude severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high \nfever. Contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your child experiences \none of these symptoms. \n\n\u2022 blood in stools \n\u2022 in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal \n\nbetween breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. \n\u2022 children with a rare inherited illness called Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) \n\nmay have an inflamed stomach or gut (gastroenteritis) and pass the vaccine virus in their \nstools. The signs of gastroenteritis may include feeling sick, being sick, stomach cramps or \ndiarrhoea. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf your child gets any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Rotarix \n \nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date refers to the \nlast day of that month. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n81 \n \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nThe vaccine should be used immediately after opening. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

in which one segment of bowel becomes enfolded within another segment). if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called severe combined immunodeficiency (scid). if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. it might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until recovery. a minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. it might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until recovery. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives rotarix if: he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, e.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or if his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune system. after your child has received rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high fever (see also section 4 \"possible side effects\"). as always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. other medicines and rotarix tell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has recently received any other vaccine. rotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis b vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup c conjugate vaccines. rotarix with food and drink there are no restrictions on your child's consumption of food or liquids, either before or after vaccination. breast-feeding based on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against rotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by rotarix. therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the vaccination schedule. rotarix contains sucrose and sorbitol if you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, contact your

uncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): abdominal pain (see also below for signs of very rare side effects of intussusception) flatulence inflammation of the skin side effects that have been reported during marketed use of rotarix include: very rare: hives (urticaria) very rare: intussusception (part of the intestine gets blocked or twisted). the signs may include severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high fever. contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your child experiences one of these symptoms. blood in stools in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. children with a rare inherited illness called severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) may have an inflamed stomach or gut (gastroenteritis) and pass the vaccine virus in their stools. the signs of gastroenteritis may include feeling sick, being sick, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. reporting of side effects if your child gets any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects
