NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTemodal 5 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach hard capsule contains 5 mg temozolomide.\n\nExcipient with known effect:\nEach hard capsule contains 132.8 mg of anhydrous lactose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule (capsule).\n\nThe hard capsules have an opaque white body, an opaque green cap, and are imprinted with black ink. \nThe cap is imprinted with \u201cTemodal\u201d. The body is imprinted with \"5 mg\", the Schering-Plough logo \nand two stripes.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTemodal is indicated for the treatment of:\n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.\n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTemodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain \ntumours.\n\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nTemodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up \nto 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).\n\nConcomitant phase \n\nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l\n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during\n\nconcomitant radiotherapy and TMZ\n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count \uf0b3 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 10\n9/l\n\nThrombocyte count \uf0b3 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 10\n9/l\n\nCTC non-haematological toxicity\n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting)\n\nCTC Grade 2 CTC Grade 3 or 4\n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: absolute neutrophil \ncount \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count \uf0b3 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological toxicity \uf0a3 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \nnausea, vomiting).\n\nMonotherapy phase\n\nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to \n6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for \n5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to \n200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.\n\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.\n\nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.\n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n\nElderly patients\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTemodal hard capsules should be administered in the fasting state.\n\nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n\nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).\n\nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections\n\nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).\n\nMeningoencephalitis herpetic\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration.\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n\nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the \n42-day regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, \nthey are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1.\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids.\n\nHBV\n\nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should \nbe monitored and managed appropriately.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after \neach treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should \nassess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after \nthe last treatment with temozolomide.\n\nMalignancies\n\nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).\n\nAnti-emetic therapy\n\nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n\nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.\n\nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nLaboratory parameters\n\nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\uf0b3 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nElderly patients (> 70 years of age)\n\nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients.\n\nMale patients\n\nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6).\n\nLactose\n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose\nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n\nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area \nunder the curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temodal should be \nadministered without food.\n\nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.\n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits \nlow protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal \nproducts (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \n\nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temodal should not \nbe administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ.\n\nMale fertility\n\nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father \na child up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nClinical trial experience\n\nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.\n\nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 \u2013 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed\nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (\u2265 1/10); Common \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 \nor Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of \nthe patients who received TMZ. \n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nLaboratory results\n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.\n\nGender\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 \nneutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9 % vs 3 %, in \nwomen vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % \n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nof female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male \nsubjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of \ntherapy.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmulti-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring \nat the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair \nof the methyl adduct.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first \nday of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank \np < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % \nvs 10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by \nTMZ monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone \n(Figure 1).\n\nH R  (95%  C .I.) =  1 .59  (1 .33 \u2013 1 .91)\nlog-rank p-value <  .0001\n\n12.1 14.6\n\nRT+TM Z\n\nRT O n ly\n\n26%\n\n10%\n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)\n\nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.\n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \uf0b3 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-\ncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was \n2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on \nMRI scans was 8 %.\n\nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for \nTMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving \npatients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) \n(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a \nKPS \uf0b3 80.\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). \nThe median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ \nthan for procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). \n\nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma\n\nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results\nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-\n(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-\nimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption.\n\nDistribution\n\nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances.\n\nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on \nAUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.\n\nElimination\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of \n14C elimination is renal. \n\nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution \nand half-life are independent of dose. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, \nbecause the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable \neffect has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.\n\nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short \neven for an alkylating agent.\n\nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTemodal is indicated for the treatment of:\n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.\n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTemodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain \ntumours.\n\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nTemodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up \nto 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).\n\nConcomitant phase \n\nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l\n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during\n\nconcomitant radiotherapy and TMZ\n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count \uf0b3 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 10\n9/l\n\nThrombocyte count \uf0b3 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 10\n9/l\n\nCTC non-haematological toxicity\n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting)\n\nCTC Grade 2 CTC Grade 3 or 4\n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: absolute neutrophil \ncount \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count \uf0b3 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological toxicity \uf0a3 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \nnausea, vomiting).\n\nMonotherapy phase\n\nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to \n6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for \n5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to \n200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.\n\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.\n\nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.\n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n\nElderly patients\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTemodal hard capsules should be administered in the fasting state.\n\nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n\nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).\n\nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections\n\nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).\n\nMeningoencephalitis herpetic\n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration.\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n\nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the \n42-day regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, \nthey are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1.\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids.\n\nHBV\n\nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should \nbe monitored and managed appropriately.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after \neach treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should \nassess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after \nthe last treatment with temozolomide.\n\nMalignancies\n\nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).\n\nAnti-emetic therapy\n\nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n\nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.\n\nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nLaboratory parameters\n\nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\uf0b3 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nElderly patients (> 70 years of age)\n\nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients.\n\nMale patients\n\nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6).\n\nLactose\n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n\nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area \nunder the curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temodal should be \nadministered without food.\n\nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.\n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits \nlow protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal \nproducts (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \n\nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temodal should not \nbe administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ.\n\nMale fertility\n\nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father \na child up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nClinical trial experience\n\nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.\n\nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 \u2013 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed\nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (\u2265 1/10); Common \n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 \nor Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of \nthe patients who received TMZ. \n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nLaboratory results\n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.\n\nGender\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 \nneutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9 % vs 3 %, in \nwomen vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % \n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nof female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male \nsubjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of \ntherapy.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmulti-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring \nat the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair \nof the methyl adduct.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first \nday of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n27\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank \np < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % \nvs 10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by \nTMZ monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone \n(Figure 1).\n\nH R  (95%  C .I.) =  1 .59  (1 .33 \u2013 1 .91)\nlog-rank p-value <  .0001\n\n12.1 14.6\n\nRT+TM Z\n\nRT O n ly\n\n26%\n\n10%\n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)\n\nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.\n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \uf0b3 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-\ncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was \n2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on \nMRI scans was 8 %.\n\nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for \nTMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving \npatients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) \n(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a \nKPS \uf0b3 80.\n\nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). \n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nThe median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ \nthan for procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). \n\nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma\n\nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results\nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-\n(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-\nimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption.\n\nDistribution\n\nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances.\n\nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on \nAUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.\n\nElimination\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of \n14C elimination is renal. \n\nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.\n\nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution \nand half-life are independent of dose. \n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nSpecial populations\n\nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, \nbecause the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable \neffect has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.\n\nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short \neven for an alkylating agent.\n\nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTemodal is indicated for the treatment of:\n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.\n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTemodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain \ntumours.\n\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nTemodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up \nto 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).\n\nConcomitant phase \n\nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l\n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for \n5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to \n200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.\n\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.\n\nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.\n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n\nElderly patients\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTemodal hard capsules should be administered in the fasting state.\n\nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n\nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).\n\nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections\n\nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).\n\nMeningoencephalitis herpetic\n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration.\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n\nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the \n42-day regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, \nthey are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1.\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids.\n\nHBV\n\nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should \nbe monitored and managed appropriately.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after \neach treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should \nassess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after \nthe last treatment with temozolomide.\n\nMalignancies\n\nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).\n\nAnti-emetic therapy\n\nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n\nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.\n\nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n36\n\nLaboratory parameters\n\nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\uf0b3 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nElderly patients (> 70 years of age)\n\nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients.\n\nMale patients\n\nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6).\n\nLactose\n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n\nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area \nunder the curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temodal should be \nadministered without food.\n\nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.\n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits \nlow protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal \nproducts (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n37\n\nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \n\nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temodal should not \nbe administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ.\n\nMale fertility\n\nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father \na child up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nClinical trial experience\n\nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.\n\nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 \u2013 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed\nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (\u2265 1/10); Common \n\n \n\n\n\n38\n\n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 \nor Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of \nthe patients who received TMZ. \n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nLaboratory results\n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.\n\nGender\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 \nneutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9 % vs 3 %, in \nwomen vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % \n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\nof female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male \nsubjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of \ntherapy.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmulti-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring \nat the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair \nof the methyl adduct.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first \nday of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n42\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank \np < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % \nvs 10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by \nTMZ monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone \n(Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)\n\nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.\n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \uf0b3 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-\ncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was \n2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on \nMRI scans was 8 %.\n\nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for \nTMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving \npatients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) \n(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a \nKPS \uf0b3 80.\n\nH R  (95%  C .I.) =  1 .59 (1 .33  \u2013 1 .91)\nlog-rank p -value  <  .0001\n\n12.1 14.6\n\nRT+TM Z\n\nRT O n ly\n\n26%\n\n10%\n\n \n\n\n\n43\n\nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). \nThe median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ \nthan for procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). \n\nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma\n\nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results\nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-\n(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-\nimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption.\n\nDistribution\n\nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances.\n\nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on \nAUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.\n\nElimination\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of \n14C elimination is renal. \n\nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.\n\n \n\n\n\n44\n\nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution \nand half-life are independent of dose. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, \nbecause the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable \neffect has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.\n\nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short \neven for an alkylating agent.\n\nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTemodal is indicated for the treatment of:\n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.\n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTemodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain \ntumours.\n\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nTemodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up\nto 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).\n\nConcomitant phase \n\nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n \n\n\n\n48\n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l\n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during\n\nconcomitant radiotherapy and TMZ\n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count \uf0b3 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 10\n9/l\n\nThrombocyte count \uf0b3 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 10\n9/l\n\nCTC non-haematological toxicity\n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting)\n\nCTC Grade 2 CTC Grade 3 or 4\n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: absolute neutrophil \ncount \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count \uf0b3 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological toxicity \uf0a3 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \nnausea, vomiting).\n\nMonotherapy phase\n\nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to \n6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for \n5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to \n200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.\n\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.\n\nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.\n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n\nElderly patients\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTemodal hard capsules should be administered in the fasting state.\n\nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n\nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).\n\nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections\n\nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).\n\nMeningoencephalitis herpetic\n\n \n\n\n\n50\n\nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration.\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n\nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the \n42-day regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, \nthey are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1.\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids.\n\nHBV\n\nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should \nbe monitored and managed appropriately.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after \neach treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should \nassess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after \nthe last treatment with temozolomide.\n\nMalignancies\n\nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).\n\nAnti-emetic therapy\n\nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n\nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.\n\nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nLaboratory parameters\n\nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\uf0b3 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nElderly patients (> 70 years of age)\n\nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients.\n\nMale patients\n\nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6).\n\nLactose\n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n\nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area \nunder the curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temodal should be \nadministered without food.\n\nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.\n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits \nlow protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal \nproducts (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \n\nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temodal should not \nbe administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ.\n\nMale fertility\n\nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father \na child up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nClinical trial experience\n\nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.\n\nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 \u2013 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed\nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (\u2265 1/10); Common \n\n \n\n\n\n53\n\n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 \nor Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of \nthe patients who received TMZ. \n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nLaboratory results\n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.\n\nGender\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 \nneutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l ), 9 % vs 3 %, in \nwomen vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % \n\n \n\n\n\n56\n\nof female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male \nsubjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of \ntherapy.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmulti-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring \nat the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair \nof the methyl adduct.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first \nday of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n57\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank \np < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % \nvs 10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by \nTMZ monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone \n(Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)\n\nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.\n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \uf0b3 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-\ncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was \n2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on \nMRI scans was 8 %.\n\nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for \nTMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving \npatients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) \n(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a \nKPS \uf0b3 80.\n\nH R  (95%  C .I.) =  1 .59 (1 .33  \u2013 1 .91)\nlog-rank p -value  <  .0001\n\n12.1 14.6\n\nRT+TM Z\n\nRT O n ly\n\n26%\n\n10%\n\n \n\n\n\n58\n\nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). \nThe median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ \nthan for procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). \n\nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma\n\nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results\nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-\n(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-\nimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption.\n\nDistribution\n\nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances.\n\nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on \nAUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.\n\nElimination\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of \n14C elimination is renal. \n\nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.\n\n \n\n\n\n59\n\nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution \nand half-life are independent of dose. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, \nbecause the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable \neffect has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.\n\nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short \neven for an alkylating agent.\n\nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTemodal is indicated for the treatment of:\n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.\n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTemodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain \ntumours.\n\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nTemodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up \nto 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).\n\nConcomitant phase \n\nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n \n\n\n\n63\n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l\n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during\n\nconcomitant radiotherapy and TMZ\n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count \uf0b3 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 10\n9/l\n\nThrombocyte count \uf0b3 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 10\n9/l\n\nCTC non-haematological toxicity\n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting)\n\nCTC Grade 2 CTC Grade 3 or 4\n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: absolute neutrophil \ncount \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count \uf0b3 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological toxicity \uf0a3 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \nnausea, vomiting).\n\nMonotherapy phase\n\nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to \n6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for \n5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to \n200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.\n\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.\n\nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.\n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n\nElderly patients\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTemodal hard capsules should be administered in the fasting state.\n\nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n\nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).\n\nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections\n\nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).\n\nMeningoencephalitis herpetic\n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration.\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n\nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-\nday regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, \nthey are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1.\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids.\n\nHBV\n\nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should \nbe monitored and managed appropriately.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after \neach treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should \nassess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after \nthe last treatment with temozolomide.\n\nMalignancies\n\nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).\n\nAnti-emetic therapy\n\nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n\nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.\n\nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n66\n\nLaboratory parameters\n\nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\uf0b3 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nElderly patients (> 70 years of age)\n\nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients.\n\nMale patients\n\nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6).\n\nLactose\n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n\nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area \nunder the curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temodal should be \nadministered without food.\n\nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.\n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits \nlow protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal \nproducts (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n67\n\nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \n\nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temodal should not \nbe administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ.\n\nMale fertility\n\nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father \na child up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nClinical trial experience\n\nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.\n\nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 \u2013 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed\nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 \nor Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of \nthe patients who received TMZ. \n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nLaboratory results\n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.\n\nGender\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 \nneutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9 % vs 3 %, in \nwomen vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % \n\n \n\n\n\n71\n\nof female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male \nsubjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of \ntherapy.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmulti-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring \nat the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair \nof the methyl adduct.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first \nday of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n72\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank \np < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % \nvs 10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by \nTMZ monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone \n(Figure 1).\n\nH R  (95%  C .I.) =  1 .59  (1 .33 \u2013 1 .91)\nlog-rank p-value <  .0001\n\n12.1 14.6\n\nRT+TM Z\n\nRT O n ly\n\n26%\n\n10%\n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)\n\nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.\n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \uf0b3 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-\ncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was \n2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on \nMRI scans was 8 %.\n\nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for \nTMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving \npatients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) \n(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a \nKPS \uf0b3 80.\n\n \n\n\n\n73\n\nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). \nThe median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ \nthan for procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). \n\nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma\n\nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results\nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-\n(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-\nimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption.\n\nDistribution\n\nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances.\n\nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on \nAUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.\n\nElimination\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of \n14C elimination is renal. \n\nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.\n\n \n\n\n\n74\n\nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution \nand half-life are independent of dose. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, \nbecause the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable \neffect has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.\n\nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short \neven for an alkylating agent.\n\nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTemodal is indicated for the treatment of:\n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.\n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTemodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain \ntumours.\n\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nTemodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up \nto 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).\n\nConcomitant phase \n\nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n \n\n\n\n78\n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l\n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for \n5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to \n200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.\n\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.\n\nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.\n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n\nElderly patients\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTemodal hard capsules should be administered in the fasting state.\n\nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n\nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).\n\nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections\n\nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).\n\nMeningoencephalitis herpetic\n\n \n\n\n\n80\n\nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration.\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n\nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-\nday regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, \nthey are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1.\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids.\n\nHBV\n\nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should \nbe monitored and managed appropriately.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after \neach treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should \nassess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after \nthe last treatment with temozolomide.\n\nMalignancies\n\nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).\n\nAnti-emetic therapy\n\nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n\nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.\n\nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n81\n\nLaboratory parameters\n\nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\uf0b3 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nElderly patients (> 70 years of age)\n\nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients.\n\nMale patients\n\nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6).\n\nLactose\n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n\nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area \nunder the curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temodal should be \nadministered without food.\n\nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.\n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits \nlow protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal \nproducts (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n82\n\nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \n\nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temodal should not \nbe administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ.\n\nMale fertility\n\nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father \na child up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nClinical trial experience\n\nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.\n\nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 \u2013 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed\nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (\u2265 1/10); Common \n\n \n\n\n\n83\n\n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 \nor Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of \nthe patients who received TMZ. \n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nLaboratory results\n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.\n\nGender\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 \nneutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9 % vs 3 %, in \nwomen vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % \n\n \n\n\n\n86\n\nof female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male \nsubjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of \ntherapy.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmulti-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring \nat the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair \nof the methyl adduct.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first \nday of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n87\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank \np < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % \nvs 10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by \nTMZ monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone \n(Figure 1).\n\nH R  (95%  C .I.) =  1 .59  (1 .33 \u2013 1 .91)\nlog-rank p-value <  .0001\n\n12.1 14.6\n\nRT+TM Z\n\nRT O n ly\n\n26%\n\n10%\n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)\n\nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.\n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \uf0b3 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-\ncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was \n2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on \nMRI scans was 8 %.\n\nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for \nTMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving \npatients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) \n(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a \nKPS \uf0b3 80.\n\n \n\n\n\n88\n\nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). \nThe median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ \nthan for procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). \n\nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma\n\nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results\nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-\n(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-\nimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption.\n\nDistribution\n\nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances.\n\nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on \nAUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.\n\nElimination\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of \n14C elimination is renal. \n\nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.\n\n \n\n\n\n89\n\nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution \nand half-life are independent of dose. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, \nbecause the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable \neffect has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.\n\nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short \neven for an alkylating agent.\n\nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTemodal is indicated for the treatment of:\n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.\n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTemodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain \ntumours.\n\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nTemodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up \nto 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).\n\nConcomitant phase\n\nTMZ is administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy \n(60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. \nTMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day concomitant period (up to 49 days) if all \nof the following conditions are met: \n\n \n\n\n\n93\n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l \n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting).\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during\nconcomitant radiotherapy and TMZ\n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count \uf0b3 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 10\n9/l\n\nThrombocyte count \uf0b3 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 10\n9/l\n\nCTC non-haematological toxicity\n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting)\n\nCTC Grade 2 CTC Grade 3 or 4\n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: absolute neutrophil \ncount \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count \uf0b3 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological toxicity \uf0a3 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \nnausea, vomiting).\n\nMonotherapy phase\n\nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to \n6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for \n5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to \n200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.\n\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3. \n\nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day treatment \ninterruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial dose is \n150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days if there \nis no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant\nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.\n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n\nElderly patients\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTemodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution for infusion must be administered only by intravenous \ninfusion. It must not be given by other routes of administration, such as the intrathecal, \nintramuscular, or subcutaneous route. Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution for infusion may be \nadministered in the same IV line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection. It is incompatible with \ndextrose solutions.\n\nThe appropriate dose of TMZ should be infused intravenously using a pump over a period of \n90 minutes. \n\nAs with other similar chemotherapeutic agents, caution is recommended to avoid extravasation. Local \ninjection site adverse reactions, which were mostly mild and short-lived were reported in patients \nreceiving Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution for infusion. Preclinical studies did not show \npermanent tissue damage (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).\n\nTemodal is also available as a hard capsule formulation (oral use). Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for \nsolution for infusion, given as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes, is bioequivalent to the hard \ncapsule formulation (see section 5.2). \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).\n\n \n\n\n\n95\n\nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections\n\nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).\n\nMeningoencephalitis herpetic\n\nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration.\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n\nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-\nday regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, \nthey are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1.\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids.\n\nHBV\n\nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should \nbe monitored and managed appropriately.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after \neach treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should \nassess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after \nthe last treatment with temozolomide.\n\nMalignancies\n\nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).\n\nAnti-emetic therapy\n\nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ. \n\n \n\n\n\n96\n\nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.\n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.\n\nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy.\n\nLaboratory parameters\n\nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \uf0b3 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\uf0b3 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nElderly patients (> 70 years of age)\n\nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients.\n\nMale patients\n\nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6).\n\nSodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains 2.4 mmol sodium per vial. This should be taken into consideration by \npatients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n\nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.\n\n \n\n\n\n97\n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits \nlow protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal \nproducts (see section 5.2).\n\nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \n\nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). \nTemodal should not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, \nthe patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ.\n\nMale fertility\n\nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father \na child up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nClinical trial experience with hard capsules\n\nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.\n\n \n\n\n\n98\n\nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 \u2013 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed\nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (\u2265 1/10); Common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 \nor Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of \nthe patients who received TMZ. \n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nLaboratory results\n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.\n\n \n\n\n\n101\n\nGender\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 \nneutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9 % vs 3 %, in \nwomen vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % \nof female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly\u2013\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male \nsubjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of \ntherapy.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established.\n\nClinical trial experience with IV\n\nTemodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution for infusion delivers equivalent TMZ dose and exposure to \nboth TMZ and its active metabolite MTIC as the corresponding Temodal hard capsules (see \nsection 5.2). Adverse reactions reported during the two studies with the intravenous formulation \n(n=35) but not in studies using hard capsules, were infusion site reactions: pain, irritation, pruritus, \nwarmth, swelling, and erythema, as well as haematoma.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmulti-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n102\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring \nat the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair \nof the methyl adduct.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n\nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first \nday of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank \np < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % \nvs 10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by \nTMZ monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone \n(Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (Intent to treat population)\n\nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.\n\nH R  (95%  C .I.) =  1 .59 (1 .33  \u2013 1 .91)\nlog-rank p -value  <  .0001\n\n12.1 14.6\n\nRT+TM Z\n\nRT O n ly\n\n26%\n\n10%\n\n \n\n\n\n103\n\nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma\n\nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \uf0b3 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the \nnon-comparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was \n2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on \nMRI scans was 8 %.\n\nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for \nTMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving \npatients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) \n(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a \nKPS \u2265 80.\n\nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). \nThe median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ \nthan for procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). \n\nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma\n\nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results\nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, \n3- methyl(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to \n5amino-imidazole4carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, \nand to methylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of \nMTIC is thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of \nguanine. Relative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, \nrespectively. In vivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.\n\nIn an open-label, two-way crossover bioequivalence study of the pharmacokinetics of oral and \nintravenous TMZ in patients with primary CNS malignancies, Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for \nsolution for infusion administered over 90 minutes was found to be bioequivalent for Cmax and AUC \n\n \n\n\n\n104\n\nof TMZ and MTIC as compared to Temodal hard capsules, following administration of 150 mg/m2\n\ndose. Mean Cmax values for TMZ and MTIC were 7.4 \u00b5g/ml and 320 ng/ml, respectively, following \n90 minute intravenous infusion. Mean AUC (0 \uf0ae\uf0a5) values for TMZ and MTIC were 25 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml and \n1,004 ng\u2022h/ml, respectively.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption.\n\nDistribution\n\nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances.\n\nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on \nAUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data. \n\nElimination\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of \n14C elimination is renal. \n\nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, \n5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.\n\nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution \nand half-life are independent of dose. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, \nbecause the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable \neffect has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.\n\nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \n\n \n\n\n\n105\n\nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short \neven for an alkylating agent.\n\nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.\n\nThe intravenous formulation produced local irritation at the site of injection in both rabbits and rats. \nThe irritation was transient and not associated with lasting tissue damage.\n\n6.

What Temodal is and what it is used for\n\nTemodal contains a medicine called temozolomide. This medicine is an antitumour agent.\n\nTemodal is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours:\n- in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temodal is first used together with \n\nradiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy phase of \ntreatment).\n\n- in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temodal is used in these tumours if they return or get \nworse after standard treatment.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Temodal\n\nDo not take Temodal\n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called \n\nDTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include feeling itchy, breathlessness or wheezing, swelling of \nthe face, lips, tongue or throat.\n\n- if certain kinds of blood cells are severely reduced (myelosuppression), such as your white \nblood cell count and platelet count. These blood cells are important for fighting infection and \nfor proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of \nthese cells before you begin treatment.\n\n \n\n\n\n159\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temodal,\n- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection \n\ncalled Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you are a newly-diagnosed patient \n(glioblastoma multiforme) you may be receiving Temodal for 42 days in combination with \nradiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this type \nof pneumonia (PCP).\n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temodal could \ncause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.\n\n- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood \nclotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your \ndoctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change your treatment. You may also \nneed other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with Temodal. Your \nblood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temodal on your \nblood cells.\n\n- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia.\n- if you have nausea (feeling sick in your stomach) and/or vomiting which are very common side \n\neffects of Temodal (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) \nto help prevent vomiting. \nIf you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take \nTemodal until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do not take a \nsecond dose on the same day. \n\n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection, contact your doctor immediately.\n- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infections, bruising or \n\nbleeding.\n- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temodal may need to be adjusted.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There \nis limited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temodal. \n\nOther medicines and Temodal\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemodal during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor.\n\nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking \nTemodal (see also \u201cMale fertility\u201d below).\n\nYou should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temodal.\n\nMale fertility\nTemodal may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception and not \nfather a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm prior to treatment.\n\nDriving and using machines\nTemodal may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or machines or \ncycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4).\n\n \n\n\n\n160\n\nTemodal contains lactose\nTemodal contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take Temodal\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nDosage and duration of treatment\n\nYour doctor will work out your dose of Temodal. This is based on your size (height and weight) and \nif you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. \nYou may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temodal to \nprevent or control nausea and vomiting.\n\nPatients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme:\nIf you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: \n- treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first\n- followed by treatment with only Temodal (monotherapy phase).\n\nDuring the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temodal at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual dose). \nYou will take this dose every day for 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. The \nTemodal dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your \nmedicine during the concomitant phase.\nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your \nbody a chance to recover.\nThen, you will start the monotherapy phase.\n\nDuring the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temodal will be different. Your doctor \nwill work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts \n28 days. You will take your new dose of Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days (\u201cdosing days\u201d) \nof each cycle. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. Then you will have 23 days without Temodal. This \nadds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. \nAfter Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temodal once daily for 5 days followed \nby 23 days without Temodal. The Temodal dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped depending on \nyour blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each treatment cycle.\n\nPatients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temodal only:\n\nA treatment cycle with Temodal lasts 28 days. \nYou will take Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on whether or \nnot you have received chemotherapy before.\n\nIf you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temodal will be \n200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with chemotherapy, \nyour first dose of Temodal will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days.\nThen, you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle.\n\nAfter Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temodal once daily for 5 days, \nfollowed by 23 days without Temodal.\n\nBefore each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temodal dose needs to be \nadjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle.\n\n \n\n\n\n161\n\nHow to take Temodal\n\nTake your prescribed dose of Temodal once a day, preferably at the same time each day.\n\nTake the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat \nbreakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the \ncapsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you \naccidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water. \nDepending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule together, eventually \nwith different strengths (content of active substance, in mg). The colour of the capsule cap is different \nfor each strength (see in the table below). \n\nStrength Colour of the cap\n\nTemodal     5 mg hard capsules green\n\nTemodal   20 mg hard capsules yellow\n\nTemodal 100 mg hard capsules pink\n\nTemodal 140 mg hard capsules blue\n\nTemodal 180 mg hard capsules orange\n\nTemodal 250 mg hard capsules white\n\nYou should make sure you fully understand and remember the following:\n\uf0b7 how many capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to write \n\nit down (including the colour). \n\uf0b7 which days are your dosing days.\nReview the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the \nlast cycle.\n\nAlways take Temodal exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Errors in how you take this medicine may have serious health \nconsequences. \n\nIf you take more Temodal than you should\nIf you accidentally take more Temodal capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take Temodal\nTake the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with \nyour doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to \ndo so.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nContact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following:\n- a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty),\n- uncontrolled bleeding, \n\n \n\n\n\n162\n\n- seizures (convulsions),\n- fever, \n- chills,\n- severe headache that does not go away.\n\nTemodal treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause you to have \nincreased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced resistance \nto infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may be \nprolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will \nmonitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In \nsome cases, your Temodal dose will be reduced or treatment stopped.\n\nOther side effects that have been reported are listed below:\n\nVery Common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are:\n- loss of appetite, difficulty speaking, headache\n\n- vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation\n\n- rash, hair loss\n\n- tiredness\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are:\n- infections, oral infections, wound infections\n\n- reduced number of blood cells (neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia)\n\n- allergic reaction\n\n- increased blood sugar\n\n- memory impairment, depression, anxiety, confusion, inability to fall asleep or stay asleep\n\n- impaired coordination and balance\n\n- difficulty concentrating, change in mental status or alertness, forgetfulness\n\n- dizziness, impaired sensations, tingling sensations, shaking, abnormal taste\n\n- partial loss of vision, abnormal vision, double vision, dry or painful eyes\n\n- deafness, ringing in the ears, earache\n\n- blood clot in lung or legs, high blood pressure\n\n- pneumonia, shortness of breath, bronchitis, cough, inflammation of your sinuses\n\n- stomach or abdominal pain, upset stomach/heartburn, difficulty swallowing\n\n- dry skin, itching\n\n- muscle damage, muscle weakness, muscle aches and pain\n\n- painful joint, back pain\n\n- frequent urination, difficulty withholding your urine\n\n- fever, flu-like symptoms, pain, feeling unwell, a cold or the flu\n\n- fluid retention, swollen legs\n\n- liver enzyme elevations\n\n- loss of weight, weight gain\n\n- radiation injury\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) are:\n- brain infections (meningoencephalitis herpetic) including fatal cases\n\n- new or reactivated cytomegalovirus infections\n\n- reactivated hepatitis B virus infections\n\n- secondary cancers including leukaemia\n\n- reduced blood cell counts (pancytopenia, anaemia, leukopenia)\n\n- red spots under the skin\n\n \n\n\n\n163\n\n- diabetes insipidus (symptoms include increased urination and feeling thirsty), low potassium \n\nlevel in the blood\n\n- mood swings, hallucination\n\n- partial paralysis, change in your sense of smell\n\n- hearing impairment, infection of the middle ear\n\n- palpitations (when you can feel your heart beat), hot flushes\n\n- swollen stomach, difficulty controlling your bowel movements, haemorrhoids, dry mouth\n\n- hepatitis and injury to the liver (including fatal liver failure), cholestasis, increased bilirubin\n\n- blisters on body or in mouth, skin peeling, skin eruption, painful reddening of the skin, severe \n\nrash with skin swelling (including palms and soles)\n\n- increased sensitivity to sunlight, urticaria (hives), increased sweating, change in skin colour\n\n- difficulty in urinating\n\n- vaginal bleeding, vaginal irritation, absent or heavy menstrual periods, breast pain, sexual \n\nimpotence\n\n- shivering, face swelling, discolouration of the tongue, thirst, tooth disorder\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What Temodal is and what it is used for\n\nTemodal contains a medicine called temozolomide. This medicine is an antitumour agent.\n\nTemodal is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours:\n- in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temodal is first used together with \n\nradiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy phase of \ntreatment).\n\n- in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temodal is used in these tumours if they return or get \nworse after standard treatment.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Temodal\n\nDo not use Temodal\n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called \n\nDTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include feeling itchy, breathlessness or wheezing, swelling of \nthe face, lips, tongue or throat.\n\n- if certain kinds of blood cells are severely reduced (myelosuppression), such as your white \nblood cell count and platelet count. These blood cells are important for fighting infection and \nfor proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of \nthese cells before you begin treatment.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Temodal,\n- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection \n\ncalled Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you are a newly-diagnosed patient \n(glioblastoma multiforme) you may be receiving Temodal for 42 days in combination with \nradiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this type \nof pneumonia (PCP).\n\n \n\n\n\n168\n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temodal could \ncause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.\n\n- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood \nclotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your \ndoctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change your treatment. You may also \nneed other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with Temodal. Your \nblood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temodal on your \nblood cells.\n\n- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia.\n- if you have nausea (feeling sick in your stomach) and/or vomiting which are very common side \n\neffects of Temodal (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) \nto help prevent vomiting. \n\n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection, contact your doctor immediately.\n- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infections, bruising or \n\nbleeding.\n- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temodal may need to be adjusted.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There \nis limited information in patients over 3 years of age who have used Temodal.\n\nOther medicines and Temodal\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before using this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemodal during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor.\n\nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are using \nTemodal (see also \u201cMale fertility\u201d below).\n\nYou should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temodal.\n\nMale fertility\nTemodal may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception and not \nfather a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm prior to treatment.\n\nDriving and using machines\nTemodal may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or machines or \ncycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4).\n\nTemodal contains sodium\nThis medicine contains 2.4 mmol sodium per vial. This should be taken into consideration by patients \non a controlled sodium diet.\n\n3. How to use Temodal\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\n \n\n\n\n169\n\nYour doctor will work out your dose of Temodal. This is based on your size (height and weight) and \nif you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. \nYou may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after receiving Temodal to \nprevent or control nausea and vomiting.\n\nPatients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme:\nIf you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: \n- treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first\n- followed by treatment with only Temodal (monotherapy phase).\n\nDuring the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temodal at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual dose). \nYou will receive this dose every day for 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. \nThe Temodal dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate \nyour medicine during the concomitant phase.\nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your \nbody a chance to recover.\nThen, you will start the monotherapy phase.\n\nDuring the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you receive Temodal in this phase will be different. \nYour doctor will work out your exact dose.\nThere may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 days.\nYou will receive your new dose of Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days of each cycle. The \nfirst dose will be 150 mg/m2. Then you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to a 28-day \ntreatment cycle. \nAfter Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temodal once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without Temodal. \nThe Temodal dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you \ntolerate your medicine during each treatment cycle.\n\nPatients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) receiving Temodal only:\n\nA treatment cycle with Temodal lasts 28 days. \n\nYou will receive Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on whether or \nnot you have received chemotherapy before.\nIf you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temodal will be \n200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with chemotherapy, \nyour first dose of Temodal will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days.\n\nThen, you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to a 28 day treatment cycle.\n\nAfter Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temodal once daily for 5 days, \nfollowed by 23 days without Temodal.\n\nBefore each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temodal dose needs to be \nadjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle.\n\nHow Temodal is given\nTemodal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip into a vein (intravenous infusion), only over \napproximately 90 minutes. No infusion site other than a vein is acceptable.\n\nIf you use more Temodal than you should\nYour medicine is given to you by health care professionals. It is therefore unlikely that you will \nreceive more Temodal than you should. However, if you do, the doctor or nurse will treat you\naccordingly.\n\n \n\n\n\n170\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nContact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following:\n- a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty), \n- uncontrolled bleeding, \n- seizures (convulsions), \n- fever, \n- chills,\n- severe headache that does not go away.\n\nTemodal treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause you to have \nincreased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced resistance \nto infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may be \nprolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will \nmonitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In \nsome cases, your Temodal dose will be reduced or treatment stopped.\n\nOther side effects that have been reported are listed below:\n\nVery Common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are:\n- loss of appetite, difficulty speaking, headache\n\n- vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation\n\n- rash, hair loss\n\n- tiredness\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are:\n- infections, oral infections, wound infections\n\n- reduced number of blood cells (neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia)\n\n- allergic reaction\n\n- increased blood sugar\n\n- memory impairment, depression, anxiety, confusion, inability to fall asleep or stay asleep\n\n- impaired coordination and balance\n\n- difficulty concentrating, change in mental status or alertness, forgetfulness\n\n- dizziness, impaired sensations, tingling sensations, shaking, abnormal taste\n\n- partial loss of vision, abnormal vision, double vision, dry or painful eyes\n\n- deafness, ringing in the ears, earache\n\n- blood clot in lung or legs, high blood pressure\n\n- pneumonia, shortness of breath, bronchitis, cough, inflammation of your sinuses\n\n- stomach or abdominal pain, upset stomach/heartburn, difficulty swallowing\n\n- dry skin, itching\n\n- muscle damage, muscle weakness, muscle aches and pain\n\n- painful joint, back pain\n\n- frequent urination, difficulty withholding your urine\n\n- fever, flu-like symptoms, pain, feeling unwell, a cold or the flu\n\n- fluid retention, swollen legs\n\n- liver enzyme elevations\n\n \n\n\n\n171\n\n- loss of weight, weight gain\n\n- radiation injury\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) are:\n- brain infections (meningoencephalitis herpetic) including fatal cases\n\n- new or reactivated cytomegalovirus infections\n\n- reactivated hepatitis B virus infections\n\n- secondary cancers including leukaemia\n\n- reduced blood cell counts (pancytopenia, anaemia, leukopenia)\n\n- red spots under the skin\n\n- diabetes insipidus (symptoms include increased urination and feeling thirsty), low potassium \n\nlevel in the blood\n\n- mood swings, hallucination\n\n- partial paralysis, change in your sense of smell\n\n- hearing impairment, infection of the middle ear\n\n- palpitations (when you can feel your heart beat), hot flushes\n\n- swollen stomach, difficulty controlling your bowel movements, haemorrhoids, dry mouth\n\n- hepatitis and injury to the liver (including fatal liver failure), cholestasis, increased bilirubin\n\n- blisters on body or in mouth, skin peeling, skin eruption, painful reddening of the skin, severe \n\nrash with skin swelling (including palms and soles)\n\n- increased sensitivity to sunlight, urticaria (hives), increased sweating, change in skin colour\n\n- difficulty in urinating\n\n- vaginal bleeding, vaginal irritation, absent or heavy menstrual periods, breast pain, sexual \n\nimpotence\n\n- shivering, face swelling, discolouration of the tongue, thirst, tooth disorder\n\nTemodal powder for solution for infusion\nIn addition to the side effects listed above, the following may also occur with the use of Temodal \npowder for solution for infusion: pain, irritation, itching, warmth, swelling or redness at the injection \nsite; also bruising (haematoma).\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. dosage and duration of treatment your doctor will work out your dose of temodal. this is based on your size (height and weight) and if you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. you may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking temodal to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: if you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: - treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first - followed by treatment with only temodal (monotherapy phase). during the concomitant phase, your doctor will start temodal at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual dose). you will take this dose every day for 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. the temodal dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. once the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks. this will give your body a chance to recover. then, you will start the monotherapy phase. during the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take temodal will be different. your doctor will work out your exact dose. there may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). each one lasts 28 days. you will take your new dose of temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days (\"dosing days\") of each cycle. the first dose will be 150 mg/m2. then you will have 23 days without temodal. this adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. after day 28, the next cycle will begin. you will again take temodal once daily for 5 days followed by 23 days without temodal. the temodal dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each treatment cycle. patients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking temodal only: a treatment cycle with temodal lasts 28 days. you will take temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days. this daily dose depends on whether or not you have received chemotherapy before. if you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of temodal will be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. if you have been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of temodal will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. then, you will have 23 days without temodal. this adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. after day 28, the next cycle will begin. you will again receive temodal once daily for 5 days, followed by 23 days without temodal. before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the temodal dose needs to be adjusted. depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle. how to take temodal take your prescribed dose of temodal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. take the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat breakfast. swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. do not open, crush or chew the capsules. if a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. if you accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water. depending on the
