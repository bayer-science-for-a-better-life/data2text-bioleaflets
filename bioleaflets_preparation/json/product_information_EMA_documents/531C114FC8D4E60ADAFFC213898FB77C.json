PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection  \nInfanrix Penta is a turbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nInfanrix Penta is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants against diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis, hepatitis B and poliomyelitis.  \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrimary vaccination: \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses of 0.5 ml (such as 2, 3, 4 months; 3, 4, 5 \nmonths; 2, 4, 6 months) or two doses (such as 3, 5 months). There should be an interval of at least 1 \nmonth between doses.  \n \n\n2 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nThe Expanded Program on Immunisation schedule (at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age) may only be used if a \ndose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth. \n \nLocally established immunoprophylactic measures against hepatitis B should be maintained. \n \nWhere a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, Infanrix Penta can be used as a replacement for \nsupplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of six weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B \nvaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used. \n \nBooster vaccination: \n \nAfter a vaccination with 2 doses (e.g. 3, 5 months) of Infanrix Penta a booster dose must be given at \nleast 6 months after the last priming dose, preferably between 11 and 13 months of age. \n \nAfter vaccination with 3 doses (e.g. 2, 3, 4 months; 3, 4, 5 months; 2, 4, 6 months) of Infanrix Penta a \nbooster dose must be given at least 6 months after the last priming dose and preferably before 18 \nmonths of age. \n \nBooster doses should be given in accordance with the official recommendations. \n \nInfanrix Penta can be considered for the booster if the composition is in accordance with the official \nrecommendations. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Infanrix Penta in children over 36 months. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInfanrix Penta is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably at alternating sites for subsequent \ninjections. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients or neomycin and polymyxin. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B or polio \nvaccines. \n \nInfanrix Penta is contraindicated if the infant has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown \naetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine. \nIn these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and the vaccination should be \ncontinued with diphtheria-tetanus, hepatitis B and polio vaccines. \n \nAs with other vaccines, administration of Infanrix Penta should be postponed in subjects suffering \nfrom acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous \nvaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. \n \nIf any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussis-\ncontaining vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines should be \ncarefully considered: \n\n• Temperature of ≥ 40.0 C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause; \n\n3 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episode) within 48 hours of \nvaccination; \n\n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination; \n• Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. \n\nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits \noutweigh possible risks. \n \nAs for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Infanrix Penta or deferring this \nvaccination should be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or \nprogression of a severe neurological disorder. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.  \n \nInfanrix Penta should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nInfanrix Penta should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. \n \nInfanrix Penta will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae, \nClostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, hepatitis B virus or poliovirus. However, it can be expected \nthat hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not \noccur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. \n \nAs with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section \n5.1). \n \nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \n(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Infanrix Penta. Vaccinees with a history of \nfebrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days \npost vaccination. \n \nHIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expected immunological response may not \nbe obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \nAs the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or \ndelayed.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that Infanrix Penta can be administered simultaneously with \nHaemophilus influenzae type b vaccines. In these clinical studies, the injectable vaccines were given at \ndifferent injection sites. \n \nThere are no data with regard to the efficacy and safety of simultaneous administration of Infanrix \nPenta and Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine. \n \nAs with other vaccines, it may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy an \nadequate response may not be achieved.   \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs Infanrix Penta is not intended for use in adults, adequate human data on use during pregnancy or \nlactation and adequate animal reproduction studies are not available. \n\n4 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines   \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n• Clinical trials \n \nThe safety profile presented below is based on data from more than 10,000 subjects. In virtually all \ninstances, Infanrix Penta was administered at the same time as a Hib vaccine. \n \nAs has been observed for DTPa and DTPa-containing combinations, an increase in local \nreactogenicity and fever was reported after booster vaccination with Infanrix Penta with respect to the \nprimary course. \n \n\n- Tabulated summary of adverse reactions (clinical trials): \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nFrequencies per dose are defined as follows: \n \nVery common: (≥ 1/10) \nCommon: (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon: (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare:  (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare: (<1/10,000) \n \nNervous system disorders: \nUncommon: somnolence \nVery rare: convulsions (with or without fever) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon: diarrhoea, vomiting \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUncommon: dermatitis, rash \nVery rare: urticaria \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: appetite lost \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common: fever ≥ 38°C, local swelling at the injection site (≤ 50 mm), fatigue, pain, redness \nCommon: fever >39.5°C, local swelling at the injection site (> 50 mm)*, injection site reactions, \nincluding induration  \nUncommon: diffuse swelling of the injected limb, sometimes involving the adjacent joint* \n \nPsychiatric disorders: \nVery common: crying abnormal, irritability, restlessness \nUncommon: nervousness \n \n\n5 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n• Post-marketing surveillance \n \nNervous system disorders: \nCollapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episode) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nApnoea [see section 4.4 for apnoea in very premature infants (≤ 28 weeks of gestation)]  \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nSwelling of the entire injected limb* \n \nImmune system disorders \nAllergic reactions, including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions  \n \n• Experience with hepatitis B vaccine: \n \nIn extremely rare cases, paralysis, neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis \nand meningitis have been reported.  The causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established. \nThrombocytopenia has been reported with hepatitis B vaccine. \n \n* Children primed with acellular pertussis vaccines are more likely to experience swelling reactions \nafter booster administration in comparison with children primed with whole cell vaccines.  These \nreactions resolve over an average of 4 days. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5.

The vaccine \nefficacy was found to be 84%. In a follow-up of the same cohort, the efficacy was confirmed up \nto 60 months after completion of primary vaccination without administration of a booster dose \nof pertussis. \n\n \nResults of long term follow-up in Sweden demonstrate that acellular pertussis vaccines are efficacious \nin infants when administered according to the 3 and 5 months primary vaccination schedule, with a \n\n7 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nbooster dose administered at approximately 12 months. However, data indicate that protection against \npertussis may be waning at 7-8 years of age with this 3-5-12 months schedule. This suggests that a \nsecond booster dose of pertussis vaccine is warranted in children aged 5-7 years who have previously \nbeen vaccinated following this particular schedule. \n \nProtective antibodies against hepatitis B have been shown to persist for at least 3.5 years in more than \n90% of children administered four doses of a combined vaccine containing the same HBs antigen as \nInfanrix Penta. Antibody levels were not different from what was observed in a parallel cohort \nadministered 4 doses of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEvaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, specific \ntoxicity, repeated dose toxicity and compatibility of ingredients. \n \n \n6.

Further information \n \n \n1.   WHAT INFANRIX PENTA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nInfanrix Penta is a vaccine used to protect your child again five diseases:  \n• Diphtheria - a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. \n\nThe airways become swollen causing serious breathing problems and sometimes suffocation. The \nbacteria also release a poison. This can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. \n\n \n• Tetanus - tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds \n\nthat are more likely to get tetanus infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds that have \nsoil, dust, horse manure or wood splinters in them. The bacteria release a poison. This can cause \nmuscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death. The muscle spasms can be strong \nenough to cause bone fractures of the spine. \n\n \n• Whooping cough (Pertussis) - a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It causes severe \n\ncoughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a “whooping” sound. \nThe cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can also cause ear \ninfections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung infections (pneumonia), \nfits, brain damage and even death.   \n\n \n• Hepatitis B - is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It makes the liver swollen. The virus is found in \n\nbody fluids such as in the vagina, blood, semen, or spit (saliva) of infected people. \n \n• Polio - a viral infection. Polio is often only a mild illness. However, sometimes it can be very \n\nserious and cause permanent damage or even death. Polio can make the muscles unable to move \n(paralysis). This includes the muscles needed for breathing and walking. The arms or legs affected \nby the disease may be painfully twisted (deformed). \n\n \nHow the vaccine works \n• Infanrix Penta helps your child’s body make its own protection (antibodies). This will protect your \n\nchild against these diseases. \n• As with all vaccines, Infanrix Penta may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated. \n• The vaccine cannot cause the diseases that it protects your child from. \n \n\n19 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n2.   BEFORE YOUR CHILD RECEIVES INFANRIX PENTA \n \nInfanrix Penta should not be given if: \n \n• your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to  \n\n- Infanrix Penta, or any ingredients in Infanrix Penta (listed in Section 6)  \n- neomycin or polymyxin (antibiotics). \n\nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the \nface or tongue. \n\n• your child has had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping \ncough, hepatitis B or polio. \n\n• your child has had problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination \nwith a vaccine against whooping cough. \n\n• your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  \nA minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. \n\n \nInfanrix Penta should not be given if any of the above apply to your child. If you are not sure, talk to \nyour doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix Penta. \n \nTake special care with Infanrix Penta \n \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given this vaccine if: \n \n• after previously having Infanrix Penta or another vaccine against whooping cough, your child \n\nhad any problems, especially:  \n- a high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination \n- a collapse or ‘shock-like’ state within 48 hours of vaccination \n- persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination \n- fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination \n\n• your child has an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or epilepsy which is not \ncontrolled. After control of the disease the vaccine can be given. \n\n• your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily \n• your child tends to have fits when they have a fever, or if there is a history of this in the family. \nIf any of the above apply to your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before \nyour child is given Infanrix Penta. \n \nUsing other medicines or vaccines \nPlease tell your doctor if your child is taking or has recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or has recently had any other vaccine. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Infanrix Penta \nThis vaccine contains neomycin and polymyxin (antibiotics). Please tell your doctor if your child has \nhad an allergic reaction to these ingredients. \n \n \n3.  HOW INFANRIX PENTA IS GIVEN \n \nHow much is given \n• Your child will have a total of two or three injections with at least 1 month between each injection.  \n• You will be told by the doctor or nurse when your child should come back for their next injections. \n• If additional injections (boosters) are necessary, the doctor will tell you. \n\n \nHow the vaccine is given \n• Infanrix Penta will be given as an injection into a muscle.   \n• The vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel or into the skin. \n\n20 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \nIf your child misses a dose \n• If your child misses an injection which is due, it is important that you make another appointment. \n• Make sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course. If not, your child may not be \n\nfully protected against the diseases. \n \n \n4.   POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Infanrix Penta can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this vaccine: \n \nAllergic reactions \nIf your child has an allergic reaction, see your doctor straight away. The signs may include: \n• rashes that may be itchy or blistering \n• swelling of the eyes and face \n• difficulty in breathing or swallowing \n• a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. \nThese signs usually start very soon after the injection has been given.
