NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCONBRIZA 20 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains bazedoxifene acetate equivalent to 20 mg bazedoxifene.\n\nExcipient with known effect:\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 142.8 mg lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet.\n\nWhite to off-white, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet debossed on one side with “WY20”.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nCONBRIZA is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk \nof fracture. A significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated; \nefficacy on hip fractures has not been established.\n\nWhen determining the choice of CONBRIZA or other therapies, including oestrogens, for an \nindividual postmenopausal woman, consideration should be given to menopausal symptoms, effects \non uterine and breast tissues, and cardiovascular risks and benefits (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of CONBRIZA is one tablet once daily, at any time of day, with or without \nfood (see section 5.2).\n\nDoses higher than 20 mg are not recommended because there is no demonstrable increased efficacy \nand higher doses may be associated with additional risk (see section 5.1).\n\nSupplemental calcium and/or vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate.\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nBazedoxifene has not been sufficiently evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment; caution \nshould be used in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nNo dose adjustment is required for mild or moderate renally impaired patients.\n\n\n\n3\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\nSafety and efficacy of bazedoxifene have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment; use \nin this population is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nElderly patients\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of bazedoxifene in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nActive or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary \nembolism, and retinal vein thrombosis.\n\nCONBRIZA is only indicated for use in postmenopausal women. Bazedoxifene must not be taken by \nwomen of child-bearing potential (see sections 4.6 and 5.3).\n\nUnexplained uterine bleeding.\n\nPatients with signs or symptoms of endometrial cancer; safety in this patient group has not been \nadequately studied.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nUse of CONBRIZA is not recommended in women at an increased risk for venous thromboembolic \nevents. CONBRIZA is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In \nclinical trials, the highest rate of VTE was observed during the first year of treatment, with a relative \nrisk of 2.69 compared to placebo. After 3 years the relative risk was 1.63 and after a 5 year study \nperiod the relative risk was 1.50; after 7 years the relative risk was 1.51 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The \nrisk factors associated with VTE cases in clinical trials included: advanced age, obesity, \nimmobilisation, surgery, major trauma and malignancy. CONBRIZA should be discontinued prior to \nand during prolonged immobilisation (e.g., post-surgical recovery, prolonged bed rest), and therapy \nshould be resumed only after the patient is fully ambulatory. In addition, women taking CONBRIZA\nshould be advised to move about periodically during prolonged travel.\n\nBazedoxifene has not been studied in premenopausal women. Its safety in premenopausal women has \nnot been established, and its use is not recommended in this population.\n\nThere is no evidence of endometrial proliferation. Any uterine bleeding during CONBRIZA therapy is \nunexpected and should be fully investigated.\n\nBazedoxifene has not been studied in women with triglyceride levels 300 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/litre). It \nmay increase serum triglyceride levels; therefore, caution should be exercised in patients with known \nhypertriglyceridaemia (see section 5.1).\n\nThe safety of CONBRIZA in patients with breast cancer has not been studied. No data are available on \nthe concomitant use with agents used in the treatment of early or advanced breast cancer. Therefore, \nbazedoxifene is not recommended for treatment or prevention of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n4\n\nBazedoxifene has not been sufficiently evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment; caution \nshould be used in this population.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment showed a 4.3-fold increase in area under the curve (AUC) [on \naverage] compared with controls. Use in this population is not recommended (see sections 4.2\nand 5.2).\n\nCONBRIZA contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a 30-day study, bazedoxifene increased hormone-binding globulin concentrations, including \ncorticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and thyroxine-binding \nglobulin (TBG).\n\nBazedoxifene undergoes metabolism by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes \nin the intestinal tract and liver (see section 5.2). The metabolism of bazedoxifene may be increased by \nconcomitant use of substances known to induce UGTs, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, and phenytoin, potentially leading to decreased systemic concentrations of \nbazedoxifene.\n\nBazedoxifene undergoes little or no cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism. Bazedoxifene \ndoes not induce or inhibit the activities of major CYP isoenzymes. In vitro data suggest that \nbazedoxifene is unlikely to interact with co-administered medicinal products via CYP-mediated \nmetabolism.\n\nThere were no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between bazedoxifene and the following \nmedicinal products: ibuprofen, atorvastatin, azithromycin, or an antacid containing aluminium and\nmagnesium hydroxide. Based on in vitro bazedoxifene plasma protein binding characteristics, drug \ninteractions with warfarin, digoxin and diazepam are unlikely.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nCONBRIZA is only for use in postmenopausal women. It is contraindicated in women of \nchild-bearing potential (see section 4.3). There are no data from the use of bazedoxifene in pregnant \nwomen. Studies in rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether bazedoxifene is excreted in human milk. CONBRIZA is only indicated for use \nin postmenopausal women (see section 4.3) and should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nStudies in rats have shown adverse effects on fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans \nis unknown. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCONBRIZA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nIn clinical trials, somnolence was reported as an adverse reaction, and patients should be advised on \nthe potential effect on driving and using machines.\n\n\n\n5\n\nPatients may experience visual symptoms such as visual acuity disturbance or blurred vision. If such \nsymptoms occur, patients should avoid driving or use of machines that requires accurate visual \nperception until symptoms have resolved, or until they have received medical advice that it is safe to \ndo so.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety of CONBRIZA has been evaluated in two multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-\nand active-control, Phase 3 trials: 7,492 evaluable postmenopausal women in a three-year osteoporosis \ntreatment trial (1,886 women received bazedoxifene 20 mg; 1,872 women received bazedoxifene \n40 mg; 1,849 women received raloxifene; 1,885 women received placebo) and 1,583 evaluable \npostmenopausal women in a 2-year osteoporosis prevention trial (321 women received bazedoxifene \n10 mg; 322 women received bazedoxifene 20 mg; 319 women received bazedoxifene 40 mg; \n311 women received raloxifene; 310 women received placebo).\n\nThe majority of adverse reactions occurring during the clinical trials were mild to moderate in severity \nand did not lead to discontinuation of therapy.\nThe most frequent drug-related adverse reactions in double-blind, randomised studies were hot flushes \nand muscle spasms (includes leg cramps).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe safety data in the following table are derived from both clinical trials and spontaneous \npost-marketing reporting.\n\nAdverse reactions are categorized according to the following frequencies: very common ( 1/10); \ncommon ( 1/100 to  1/10); uncommon ( 1/1,000 to  1/100); rare ( 1/10,000 to  1/1,000); not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nSystem organ \nclass\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Frequency not \nknown (cannot \n\nbe estimated \nfrom available \n\ndata)\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nSomnolence\n\nEye disorders Retinal vein \nthrombosis*\n\nVision \ndisorders/Ocular \nevents#\n\nCardiac disorders Palpitations\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nHot flush Deep vein \nthrombosis*,\nthrombophlebitis \nsuperficial\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nPulmonary \nembolism*\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nDry mouth\n\n\n\n6\n\nSystem organ \nclass\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Frequency not \nknown (cannot \nbe estimated \n\nfrom available \ndata)\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nUrticaria, rash, \npruritus\n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders\n\nMuscle \nspasms \n(includes \nleg cramps)\n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nOedema \nperipheral\n\nInvestigations Blood \ntriglycerides \nincreased, alanine \naminotransferase \nincreased, \naspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\n*In the osteoporosis treatment trial in 7,492 evaluable subjects (mean age=66 years), the \nbazedoxifene-treated women had an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (deep vein \nthrombosis, pulmonary embolism and retinal vein thrombosis). The rate per 1,000 women-years \nthrough the 3-year study period was 2.86 in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group and 1.76 in the placebo\ngroup, and through the 5-year study period was 2.34 in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group and 1.56 in the\nplacebo group. The rate per 1,000 women-years through the 7 year study period was 2.06 in the \nbazedoxifene 20 mg group and 1.36 in the placebo group. The rate of VTE was highest in the first year\nwith a relative risk of 2.69. After 3 years the relative risk was 1.63 and after a 5 year study period the \nrelative risk was 1.50. After 7 year study period the relative risk was 1.51 (see section 5.1). Other \nvenous thromboembolic events could also occur.\n\n#There have been post-marketing reports of ocular events other than retinal vein thrombosis. These \nreports include visual acuity reduced, blurred vision, photopsia, visual field defect, visual impairment, \ndry eye, eyelid oedema, blepharospasm, eye pain and eye swelling. The underlying nature of these \nevents is uncertain. If ocular symptoms occur, patients should be advised to seek medical attention.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the case of overdose, there is no specific antidote, and treatment should be symptomatic.\n\n\n\n7\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Selective estrogen receptor modulator, ATC code: G03XC02.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBazedoxifene belongs to a class of compounds known as selective estrogen receptor modulators \n(SERMs). Bazedoxifene acts as both an oestrogen-receptor agonist and/or antagonist, depending upon \nthe cell and tissue type and target genes. Bazedoxifene decreases bone resorption and reduces \nbiochemical markers of bone turnover to the premenopausal range. These effects on bone remodeling \nlead to an increase in bone mineral density (BMD), which in turn contributes to a reduction in the risk \nof fractures. Bazedoxifene functions primarily as an oestrogen-receptor antagonist in uterine and \nbreast tissues.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nThe efficacy of bazedoxifene was established in two multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-\nand active-control, Phase 3 trials: 3-year osteoporosis treatment trial and a 2-year osteoporosis \nprevention trial.\n\nOsteoporosis treatment trial\nIn the osteoporosis treatment study, 7,492 postmenopausal women (mean age of 66 years; range 50 to \n85 years and a mean time of 19.5 years since menopause) received bazedoxifene (20 or 40 mg daily), \nraloxifene (60 mg daily), or placebo to evaluate the incidence of new vertebral fractures over 3 years \n(3-year core study). The 3-year core study was extended twice, with two 2-year double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled extensions, resulting in a total treatment duration of up to 7 years (7-year study). A total of \n3,146 subjects continued into the first 2-year extension (bazedoxifene 20 mg: n=1,047, bazedoxifene\n40/20 mg: n=1,041, placebo: n=1,058). The bazedoxifene 40 mg dose was decreased to a 20 mg dose \nafter approximately 4 years. The raloxifene group was discontinued during the first 2-year extension.\nA total of 1,732 subjects continued into the second 2-year extension (bazedoxifene 20 mg: n=560, \nbazedoxifene 40/20 mg: n=582, and placebo: n=590). All subjects were to receive 1,200 mg of \nelemental calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D daily.\n\nThis study included mostly Caucasian (87.3%) subjects who were either osteoporotic without baseline \nvertebral fracture (BMD T-score at lumbar spine [LS] or femoral neck [FN] between -2.5 and -4.0) or \nosteoporotic, with at least 1 mild baseline vertebral fracture. The mean LS and FN T-scores at baseline \nwere -2.4 and -1.7, respectively.\n\nThere was a significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures after 3 years of treatment \nwith bazedoxifene 20 mg (42%), bazedoxifene 40 mg (37%) and raloxifene 60 mg (42%) compared to \nplacebo. The reduction in the incidence of vertebral fracture was similar among bazedoxifene and \nraloxifene treatment groups. The treatment effect was similar among those with and without prevalent\nvertebral fractures (Table 1).\n\n\n\n8\n\nTable 1: Effect of bazedoxifene on risk of vertebral fractures after 3 years of treatment\n\nNumber of subjects Absolute \nrisk \n\nreduction\n\nRelative risk \nreduction \n(95% CI)\n\nBazedoxifene \n20 mg\n\nPlacebo\n\nTotal number of subjects n=1,724 n=1,741\n\nNumber (%)a of subjects with \nnew vertebral fracture\n\n35 (2.34%) 59 (4.07%) 1.73% 42%b\n\n(11%, 62%)\nSubjects with no baseline fracture n=757 n=760\n\nNumber (%)a of subjects with ≥1 \nnew vertebral fracture\n\n13 (1.98%) 20 (3.13%) 1.15% 35%c\n\nSubjects with 1 baseline fracture n=967 n=981\n\nNumber (%)a of subjects with ≥1 \nnew vertebral fracture\n\n22 (2.63%) 39 (4.80%) 2.17% 45%d\n\n(6%, 68%)\na Kaplan-Meier rate estimates\nb p-value=0.015\nc p-value=0.22\nd p-value=0.035\n\nAfter 5 years of treatment, the incidence of new vertebral fractures remained lower in the \nbazedoxifene 20 mg group (4.49%) compared to placebo (6.82%) with a relative risk reduction of 36% \n(p=0.014).\n\nAfter 7 years of treatment, the incidence of new vertebral fractures remained lower in the \nbazedoxifene 20 mg group (7.64%) compared to placebo (9.90%) with a relative risk reduction of 30% \n(p=0.022).\n\nThe incidence of non-vertebral osteoporosis-related fractures was similar among bazedoxifene 20 mg \n(5.68%), raloxifene 60 mg (5.87%), and placebo (6.26%) groups. In a post-hoc analysis, the 10-year \nfracture probability as an index of baseline fracture risk was determined. The mean 10-year fracture \nprobability of a major osteoporotic fracture for the entire study population was 11%. In subjects \ntreated with bazedoxifene, the incidence of fractures was related to the baseline fracture risk: the \nhigher the fracture risk, the greater the benefit with bazedoxifene treatment. In subjects with 10-year \nfracture probabilities at or above 16%, bazedoxifene was associated with a significant decrease in the \nrisk of all clinical fractures.\n\nIn a post-hoc analysis, the relative risk of non-vertebral fractures in bazedoxifene-treated subjects \ndecreased with increased fracture probability. In subjects with a fracture probability of 20% or greater \n(n = 618), the risk of non-vertebral fractures in bazedoxifene-treated subjects was decreased by 55% \n(95% CI: 18-76) compared to placebo-treated subjects.\n\nThe increase in LS BMD compared with placebo with bazedoxifene 20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg was \nsignificant at 6 months (1.02% and 1.29%, respectively) and was maintained through 3 years (1.32% \nand 2.08%, respectively). The effect of bazedoxifene on BMD at other skeletal sites was similar. The \nincreases in BMD relative to placebo remained statistically significant at all skeletal sites throughout \nthe 5 years of treatment with bazedoxifene. After 7 years of treatment with bazedoxifene the increases \nin BMD relative to placebo remained statistically significant at the femoral neck, femoral trochanter, \nand total hip. The increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at 7 years in the bazedoxifene 20 mg \ngroup was not statistically greater than in the placebo group.\n\nDiscontinuation from the study was required when excessive bone loss or incident vertebral fractures \noccurred. Such discontinuation was statistically significant more frequently in the placebo group \n(4.0%) than in the bazedoxifene 20 mg (2.8%) or raloxifene 60 mg (2.1%) groups.\n\n\n\n9\n\nOsteoporosis prevention trial\nThe prevention study (1,583 subjects; mean age, 58 years; mean years since menopause, 11) compared \nBMD effects of bazedoxifene (10, 20, or 40 mg daily), raloxifene (60 mg daily), and placebo. All \nsubjects received calcium supplementation daily; most received 600 mg calcium (e.g., Caltrate) \ndaily, while some received up to 1,200 mg daily. This study included subjects who had a LS or FN \nneck BMD T-score no less than -2.5. The median T-score ranged from -0.6 to -1.4, depending on the \nskeletal site.\n\nBMD was preserved in bazedoxifene 20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg-treated subjects, while significant \nloss in BMD was observed in patients receiving placebo. The increase in LS BMD with bazedoxifene \n20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg, compared with placebo, was significant at 6 months (1.14% and 1.26%, \nrespectively) and was maintained through 2 years (1.41% and 1.49%, respectively). The effect of \nbazedoxifene on BMD at other skeletal sites was similar.\n\nClinical safety\n\nAssessment of bone histomorphometry and bone turnover\nIn the osteoporosis treatment study in 7,492 postmenopausal women (mean age = 66 years), 121 bone \nbiopsies were obtained from iliac crest after the administration of fluorochrome label from the subjects \nin bazedoxifene, raloxifene and placebo groups (bazedoxifene 20 mg = 28; bazedoxifene 40 mg = 29, \nraloxifene 60 mg = 32, placebo = 32) after approximately 2 or 3 years of treatment. Histological \nassessment of bone biopsies from all treatment groups revealed formation of normal lamellar bone in \nall treated subjects. There was no evidence of osteomalacia, peritrabecular or marrow fibrosis, cellular \ntoxicity or woven bone in any of the bone-biopsy specimens in any of the treatment groups. \nHistomorphometric assessment revealed normal mineralisation, as evidenced by the presence of \nnormal osteoid thickness, normal mineralisation lag time, and mineral apposition rate.\n\nIn the osteoporosis treatment study, bazedoxifene 20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg therapy resulted in a \nsignificant reduction of serum markers of bone resorption (C-telopeptide) and bone formation \n(osteocalcin), when compared to placebo, indicating a reduction in bone turnover. Median reductions \nfrom baseline over 25% for C-telopeptide and osteocalcin were observed with bazedoxifene therapy. \nSimilar reductions in the rate of bone turnover have been observed in the osteoporosis prevention \nstudy.\n\nEffects on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular system\nIn the osteoporosis treatment study after 3 years of treatment, bazedoxifene 20 mg and raloxifene \n60 mg exhibited significant reductions in serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \ncholesterol and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared to \nplacebo. The median percent change from baseline of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL \ncholesterol with bazedoxifene 20 mg were –3.75%, –5.36% and 5.10%, respectively, and were similar \nto that observed with raloxifene 60 mg. The effect on triglycerides in the bazedoxifene 20 mg and \nraloxifene 60 mg groups was similar to placebo. This lipid profile was maintained throughout the \n7 years of treatment. The treatment effect on lipids was similar in the osteoporosis prevention study. \nThe clinical relevance of these changes has not been established.\n\nIn the osteoporosis treatment trial in 7,492 subjects (mean age = 66 years), the bazedoxifene-treated \nwomen had an increased risk of VTE (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and retinal vein \nthrombosis) (see section 4.8). The highest rate of VTE per 1,000 women-years of follow up was \nobserved during the first year: 4.64 in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group and 1.73 in the placebo group \n(relative risk 2.69).The rate per 1,000 women-years at 3 years was 2.86 in the bazedoxifene 20 mg \ngroup and 1.76 in the placebo group (relative risk 1.63). The rate per 1,000 women-years at 5 years \nwas 2.34 in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group and 1.56 in the placebo group (relative risk 1.50). After \n7 years the rate per 1,000 women-years was 2.06 in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group and 1.36 in the \nplacebo group (relative risk 1.51).\n\n\n\n10\n\nCerebrovascular effects \nIn the 3 year core study the rate per 1,000 women-years for ischaemic strokes was similar between the \n20 mg bazedoxifene (1.98) and placebo (2.2) groups and higher in the 40 mg bazedoxifene (2.72) \ngroup. The rate per 1,000 women years for transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) was similar between the \n20 mg bazedoxifene (1.1) and placebo (0.88) groups and higher in the 40 mg bazedoxifene (1.59) \ngroup. \n\nAfter 5 years of treatment the rate per 1,000 women-years for ischaemic strokes was similar between \nthe 20 mg bazedoxifene (1.87) and the placebo (2.02) groups. The rate per 1,000 women years for TIA \nwas higher for the 20 mg bazedoxifene group (0.94) compared to placebo (0.62).\n\nAfter 7 years of treatment, the rate per 1,000 women-years for ischaemic strokes was the same for the \n20 mg bazedoxifene (1.78) and the placebo (1.78) groups. The rate per 1,000 women years for TIA \nwas higher for the bazedoxifene 20 mg group (0.96) compared to placebo (0.55).\n\nEffects on the uterus\nIn the osteoporosis treatment study, transvaginal ultrasonography (TVU) showed minimal changes in \nendometrial thickness in placebo (-0.08 mm, n=131), bazedoxifene 20 mg (-0.07 mm, n=129), and \nraloxifene 60 mg (0.16 mm, n=110) treated groups after 2 years. At 3 years, there were no cases of \nendometrial cancer and 1 case (0.1%) of endometrial hyperplasia in the bazedoxifene 20 mg-treated \nsubjects. There was 1 case (0.1%) of endometrial cancer, 1 case of sarcoma (0.1%), and 1 case (0.1%) \nof endometrial hyperplasia in the raloxifene 60 mg-treated subjects. There were 3 cases (0.2%) of \nendometrial cancer and 1 case (0.1%) of endometrial hyperplasia in the placebo group. Endometrial \npolyps were diagnosed in 10 subjects in the bazedoxifene 20 mg, 17 subjects in the raloxifene 60 mg, \nand 11 subjects in the placebo treatment groups through month 36.\n\nAfter 5 years of treatment, the endometrial thickness in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group did not change \nand remained similar to placebo; there were no cases of endometrial cancer in the bazedoxifene 20 mg \ngroup compared to 6 cases in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n\nAfter 7 years of treatment, the endometrial thickness in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group did not change \nand remained similar to placebo; there were no cases of endometrial cancer in the bazedoxifene 20 mg \ngroup compared to 7 cases in the placebo group (p<0.008).\n\nIn the osteoporosis prevention study, TVU showed minimal changes from baseline in endometrial \nthickness in placebo (-0.24 mm, n=154), bazedoxifene 20 mg (-0.06 mm, n=158) and raloxifene 60 mg \n(0.01 mm, n=154) treated groups after 2 years. No cases of hyperplasia or endometrial malignancy \nwere identified in any bazedoxifene- or raloxifene-treated subjects.\n\nEffects on the breast\nIn the osteoporosis treatment study, the incidence of breast-related adverse events in the bazedoxifene \ngroup was similar to placebo at 3 years. There were 5 cases of breast cancer per 4,591 person-years of \nfollow-up in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group (1.09 per 1,000), 7 cases of breast cancer per 4,526 \nperson-years of follow-up in the raloxifene 60 mg group (1.55 per 1,000), and 8 cases of breast cancer \nper 4,604 person-years of follow-up in the placebo group (1.74 per 1,000). After 5 years of treatment, \nthere were 9 cases of breast cancer in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group (1.40 per 1,000 women-years) \nand 10 cases in the placebo group (1.56 per 1,000 women-years). After 7 years of treatment, there \nwere 13 cases of breast cancer in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group (1.78 per 1,000 women-years) and \n11 cases in the placebo group (1.50 per 1,000 women-years).\n\nIn the osteoporosis prevention study, the incidence of breast-related adverse events (breast tenderness, \npain, breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm) in the bazedoxifene 20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg groups \nwas similar to placebo.\n\nIn the breast-density study, an ancillary study of the osteoporosis treatment study, 444 postmenopausal \nwomen (mean age = 59 years) with osteoporosis from all 4 treatment groups, were evaluated for \nmammographic breast density changes at 24 months. Mean changes in mammographic breast density \n\n\n\n11\n\nin the bazedoxifene 20 mg group were significantly reduced from baseline (-1.45 percentage points, \np<0.05) while no changes were observed in the placebo group (-0.15 percentage points). \n\nEffects on thyroid and ovarian malignancies\nIn the osteoporosis treatment study in 7,492 postmenopausal women (mean age, 66 years), among \n1,886 subjects treated with bazedoxifene (20 mg), there were 5 cases of thyroid cancer (0.69 per \n1,000) and among 1,885 subjects treated with placebo, there was 1 case of thyroid cancer (0.14 per \n1,000) after 7 years of treatment. There were no cases on thyroid cancer in the 40 mg treatment group \nup to 5 years.\n\nIn the osteoporosis treatment study in 7,492 postmenopausal women (mean age, 66 years), among \n1,886 subjects treated with bazedoxifene (20 mg), there were 5 cases of ovarian cancer (0.69 per \n1,000) and among 1,885 subjects treated with placebo, there were 0 cases of ovarian cancer after \n7 years of treatment. There was one case of ovarian cancer in the 40 mg treatment group up to 5 years.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe mean pharmacokinetic parameters of bazedoxifene after multiple doses in healthy \npostmenopausal ambulatory women who were naturally postmenopausal or who had undergone \nbilateral oophorectomy are summarized in Table 2.\n\nTable 2. Mean ± SD pharmacokinetic parameters of bazedoxifene (n=23)\nCmax\n\n(ng/ml)\ntmax\n(h)\n\nt½\n(h)\n\nAUC\n(ngh/ml)\n\nCl/F\n(l/h/kg)\n\nMultiple dose\n20 mg/day 6.2 ± 2.2 1.7 ± 1.8 28 ± 11 82 ± 37 4.1 ± 1.7\n\nAbsorption\n\nBazedoxifene is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 2 hours and exhibits a linear increase in \nplasma concentrations for single doses from 0.5 mg up to 120 mg and multiple daily doses from 1 mg \nto 80 mg. The absolute bioavailability of bazedoxifene is approximately 6%.\n\nWhen single doses of 20 mg bazedoxifene were administered with a high-fat meal, Cmax and AUC \nincreased by 28% and 22%, respectively. An additional study evaluating the effects of a standardized \nmedium-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of bazedoxifene at steady-state showed a 42% and 35% \nincrease in Cmax and AUC, respectively, when 20 mg bazedoxifene was administered with food. \nBecause these changes are not considered clinically relevant, bazedoxifene can be administered \nwithout regard to meals.\n\nDistribution\n\nFollowing intravenous administration of a 3 mg dose of bazedoxifene, the volume of distribution is \n14.7 ± 3.9 l/kg. Bazedoxifene is highly bound (98% - 99%) to plasma proteins in vitro.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nThe metabolic disposition of bazedoxifene in postmenopausal women has been determined following \noral administration of 20 mg of radio-labelled bazedoxifene. Bazedoxifene is extensively metabolised \nin women. Glucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway. Little or no cytochrome P450-mediated \nmetabolism is evident. Bazedoxifene-5-glucuronide is the major circulating metabolite. The \nconcentrations of this glucuronide are approximately 10-fold higher than those of unchanged active \nsubstance in plasma.\n\nElimination\n\nBazedoxifene is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 30 hours. Steady-state concentrations are \nachieved by the second week of once-daily administration. The apparent oral clearance of \n\n\n\n12\n\nbazedoxifene is approximately 4 to 5 l/h/kg. The major route of excretion of radio-labelled \nbazedoxifene is the faeces, and less than 1% of the dose is eliminated in urine.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe disposition of a single 20 mg dose of bazedoxifene was compared in patients with hepatic \nimpairment [Child-Pugh Class A (n=6), B (n=6), and C (n=6)] and subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction (n=18). On average, patients with hepatic impairment showed a 4.3-fold increase in AUC \ncompared with controls. Safety and efficacy have not been evaluated further in patients with hepatic \ninsufficiency. Use in this patient population is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nLimited clinical data (n=5) are available in subjects with moderate renal impairment \n(CrCl  50 ml/min). A single 20 mg dose of bazedoxifene was administered to these subjects. \nNegligible amounts of bazedoxifene were eliminated in urine. Impaired renal function showed little or \nno influence on bazedoxifene pharmacokinetics, and no dosing adjustment is required.\n\nElderly patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of a 20 mg single-dose of bazedoxifene were evaluated in a study in 26 healthy \npostmenopausal women. On average, compared to women 51 to 64 years of age (n=8), women 65 to \n74 years of age (n=8) showed a 1.5-fold increase in AUC, and women 75 years of age (n=8) showed \na 2.3-fold increase in AUC. This increase was most likely attributed to age-related changes in hepatic \nfunction. No dose adjustment is necessary based on age.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of bazedoxifene have not been studied in the paediatric population.\n\nRace\nNo pharmacokinetic differences based on ethnic group were observed.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn rabbit studies, abortion and an increased incidence of heart (ventricular septal defect) and skeletal \nsystem (ossification delays, misshapen or misaligned bones, primarily of the spine and skull) \nanomalies in the foetuses were present at maternally toxic doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.5 times the \nhuman exposure). Treatment of rats at maternally toxic doses 1 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the human \nexposure) resulted in reduced numbers of live foetuses and/or reductions in foetal body weights. No \nfoetal developmental anomalies were observed.\n\nFemale rats were administered daily doses of 0.3 to 30 mg/kg (0.03 to 8 times the human exposure) \nprior to and during mating with untreated males. Oestrous cycles and fertility were adversely affected \nin all bazedoxifene-treated female groups.\n\nThe effects of bazedoxifene treatment on bone, uterus, and mammary gland were assessed in \novariectomized rats (0.15 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) and non-human primates [Cynomolgus macaques] (0.2 to \n25.0 mg/kg/day). In rats, treatment with bazedoxifene for approximately one year partially prevented \nthe effects of ovariectomy on numerous skeletal parameters (bone mineral content, bone mineral \ndensity, and architecture). Additionally, uterine wet weights were reduced compared with untreated \nanimals and histologic evaluation demonstrated little to no difference from the untreated controls. In \nmonkeys, treatment with bazedoxifene for 18 months resulted in the partial preservation of cortical \nand cancellous bone mass as determined by BMD measurements. The partial preservation of bone \nmass was achieved by reductions in the ovariectomy-induced increases in bone turnover, evaluated by \nbiochemical markers of bone turnover and histomorphometric indices measured in cancellous and \ncortical bone. Importantly, in both species, the administration of bazedoxifene had no deleterious \neffects on bone quality. Like the rodent results, bazedoxifene treatment in non-human primates \n\n\n\n13\n\nresulted in uterine and mammary gland atrophy without other histological differentiation from \nuntreated animals.\n\nRepeated-dose studies in normally cycling rodents and cynomolgus monkeys revealed a marked \nstimulation of ovarian follicle growth without ovulation, leading to partly haemorrhagic-ovarian cysts \nand markedly elevated estradiol levels. This pharmacological effect of bazedoxifene can also be \nexpected in pre-menopausal women, but is considered clinically irrelevant in post-menopausal \nwomen.\n\nIn 6-month carcinogenicity studies in transgenic mice, there was an increased incidence of benign, \novarian granulosa-cell tumours in female mice given 150 or 500 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure \n(AUC) to bazedoxifene in these groups was 35 and 69 times that in postmenopausal women \nadministered 20 mg/day for 14 days.\n\nIn a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, an increased incidence of benign, ovarian granulosa-cell \ntumours was observed in female rats at dietary concentrations of 0.03 and 0.1%. Systemic exposure \n(AUC) of bazedoxifene in these groups was 2.6 and 6.6 times that observed in postmenopausal women \nadministered 20 mg/day for 14 days.\n\nThe observation of benign, ovarian granulosa-cell tumours in female mice and rats administered \nbazedoxifene is a class effect of SERMs, related to its pharmacology in rodents when treated during \ntheir reproductive lives, when their ovaries are functional and responsive to hormonal stimulation.\n\nBazedoxifene was not genotoxic or mutagenic in a battery of tests, including in vitro bacterial reverse \nmutation assay, in vitro mammalian cell forward mutation assay at the thymidine kinase (TK±) locus \nin L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary \n(CHO) cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.\n\nBazedoxifene caused corticomedullar nephrocalcinosis and enhanced spontaneous chronic progressive \nnephropathy (CPN) in male rats. Urine parameters were pathologically changed. In long-term studies \nrenal tumours (adenomas and carcinomas) were observed at all doses tested, most likely as a \nconsequence of this chronic renal damage. In the 2-year carcinogenicity study, bazedoxifene, \nadministered orally in the diet to rats at dosages of 0, 0.003%, 0.01%, 0.03%, or 0.1%, resulted in \nexposures, based on surface area (mg/m2) of approximately 0.6 to 23 times and 0.9 to 31 times in \nmales and females, respectively, the clinical dose of 20 mg. Since chronic progressive nephropathy \nand corticomedullar nephrocalcinosis are most likely rat-specific nephropathies, these findings are \npresumably not relevant for humans.\n\nIn an 18-month bone efficacy study in aged ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys, bazedoxifene, \nadministered orally to monkeys at dosages of 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg/day, resulted in exposures, \nbased on surface area (mg/m2) of approximately 0.2 to 24 times the clinical dose of 20 mg. Renal cell \ncarcinomas were observed in this study. These tumours are considered as spontaneous renal cell \ncarcinomas that are known to occur in nonhuman primates and are unlikely to be relevant to humans.\n\n6.

What CONBRIZA is and what it is used for\n\nCONBRIZA contains the active substance bazedoxifene, and is a medicine that belongs to a group of \nnon-hormonal medicines called Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs). It is used for the \ntreatment of osteoporosis in women after they have reached menopause, when they are at an increased \nrisk of fractures. It works by slowing or stopping the thinning of bone in these women. This medicine\nshould not be used for the treatment of osteoporosis in men.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take CONBRIZA\n\nDo not take CONBRIZA\n\n if you are allergic to bazedoxifene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in\nsection 6).\n\n if you have or have had a blood clot (for example, in the blood vessels in your legs, lungs, or \neyes).\n\n if you are pregnant or could still become pregnant. This medicine may cause harm to your \nunborn child if taken during pregnancy.\n\n if you have any unexplained vaginal bleeding. This must be investigated by your doctor.\n if you have active uterine cancer.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking CONBRIZA\n\n as it may increase your risk of getting blood clots. While very infrequent, these clots can cause \nserious medical problems, disability or death. Speak with your doctor to see if you are at \nincreased risk for blood clots.\n\n if you are immobile (unable to move) for some time, such as being wheel-chair bound, sitting for \na prolonged period of time or having to stay in bed while recovering from an operation or \n\n\n\n25\n\nillness. If you are traveling on long trips, you should walk around or exercise your legs and feet \nat regular intervals. This is because sitting for a long time in the same position may prevent \ngood blood circulation and may increase your risk of blood clots. If you need to remain \nimmobile for an extended period of time or are scheduled to have surgery, it is important for \nyou to talk to your doctor about ways you can reduce the risk of blood clots.\n\n if you are pre-menopausal. CONBRIZA has only been studied in women who have reached \nmenopause, and therefore is not recommended.\n\n if you have had increased levels of triglycerides (a type of fat found in your blood) in the past.\n if you have liver or severe kidney problems.\n if you have any vaginal bleeding while you take CONBRIZA, you should speak with your \n\ndoctor.\n if you are suffering from breast cancer, as there is insufficient experience with this medicine use \n\nin women with this disease.\n\nThe above are some reasons why this product may not be suitable for you. If any of them apply to you, \ntalk to your doctor before you take the medicine.\n\nOther medicines and CONBRIZA\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nCONBRIZA is for use only by postmenopausal women.
