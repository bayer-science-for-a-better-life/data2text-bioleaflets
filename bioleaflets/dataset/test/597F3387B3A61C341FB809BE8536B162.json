NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nClopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH 75 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 75 mg of clopidogrel (as besilate). \nExcipients: each film-coated tablet contains 3.80 mg of hydrogenated castor oil. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nWhite to off-white, marbled, round and biconvex film-coated tablets.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nClopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), \nischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial \ndisease. \n\n \nFor further information please refer to section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n\uf0b7 Adults and elderly \n Clopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg. \n \nIf a dose is missed: \n\n- Within less than 12 hours after regular scheduled time: patients should take the dose \nimmediately and then take the next dose at the regular scheduled time. \n\n- For more than 12 hours: patients should take the next dose at the regular scheduled time \nand should not double the dose. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Paediatric population \n Clopidogrel should not be used in children because of efficacy concerns (see section 5.1). \n \n\uf0b7 Renal impairment \n Therapeutic experience is limited in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \n\uf0b7 Hepatic impairment \n Therapeutic experience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have \n bleeding diatheses (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMethod of administration \nFor oral use \nIt may be given with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment. \n\uf0b7 Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial haemorrhage. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBleeding and haematological disorders \nDue to the risk of bleeding and haematological adverse reactions, blood cell count determination \nand/or other appropriate testing should be promptly considered whenever clinical symptoms \nsuggestive of bleeding arise during the course of treatment (see section 4.8). As with other antiplatelet \nagents, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding \nfrom trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with ASA, \nheparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including \nCox-2 inhibitors. Patients should be followed carefully for any signs of bleeding including occult \nbleeding,especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiac procedures or \nsurgery. The concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended \nsince it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.5). \n \nIf a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is temporarily not desirable, \nclopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days prior to surgery. Patients should inform physicians and \ndentists that they are taking clopidogrel before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal \nproduct is taken. Clopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should be used with caution in patients who \nhave lesions with a propensity to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular). \n \nPatients should be told that it might take longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take \nclopidogrel, and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or duration) to their physician.  \n \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely following the use of \nclopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and \nmicroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction \nor fever. TTP is a potentially fatal condition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis.  \n \nRecent ischaemic stroke \nIn view of the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute \nischaemic stroke. \n \nCytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) \nPharmacogenetics: In patients who are poor CYP2C19 metabolisers, clopidogrel at recommended \ndoses forms less of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and has a smaller effect on platelet function. \nTests are available to identify a patient's CYP2C19 genotype.  \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products \nthat inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active \nmetabolite of clopidogrel. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. As a precaution \nconcomitant use of strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors should be discouraged (see section 4.5 for \na list of CYP2C19 inhibitors, see also section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nTherapeutic experience with clopidogrel is limited in patients with renal impairment. Therefore \nclopidogrel should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.2). \n \n\n3 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nHepatic impairment \nExperience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have bleeding diatheses. \nClopidogrel should therefore be used with caution in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients  \nClopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH contains hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset \nand diarrhoea.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOral anticoagulants: the concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not \nrecommended since it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.4). Although the \nadministration of clopidogrel 75 mg/day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin or \nInternational Normalised Ratio (INR) in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, \ncoadministration of clopidogrel with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent \neffects on hemostasis. \n \nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who receive \nconcomitant glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid (ASA): ASA did not modify the clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced \nplatelet aggregation, but clopidogrel potentiated the effect of ASA on collagen-induced platelet \naggregation. However, concomitant administration of 500 mg of ASA twice a day for one day did not \nsignificantly increase the prolongation of bleeding time induced by clopidogrel intake. A \npharmacodynamic interaction between clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid is possible, leading to \nincreased risk of bleeding. Therefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section \n4.4).  \n \nHeparin: in a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects, clopidogrel did not necessitate modification \nof the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin had no \neffect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by clopidogrel. A pharmacodynamic \ninteraction between clopidogrel and heparin is possible, leading to increased risk of bleeding. \nTherefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombolytics: the safety of the concomitant administration of clopidogrel, fibrin or non-fibrin \nspecific thrombolytic agents and heparins was assessed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. \nThe incidence of clinically significant bleeding was similar to that observed when thrombolytic agents \nand heparin are co-administered with ASA (see section 4.8) \n \nNSAIDs: in a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of \nclopidogrel and naproxen increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. However, due to the lack of \ninteraction studies with other NSAIDs it is presently unclear whether there is an increased risk of \ngastrointestinal bleeding with all NSAIDs. Consequently, NSAIDs including Cox-2 inhibitors and \nclopidogrel should be co-administered with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapy:  \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal \nproducts that inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of \nthe active metabolite of clopidogrel. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. As a \nprecaution concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors should be discouraged (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP2C19 include omeprazole and esomeprazole, fluvoxamine, \nfluoxetine, moclobemide, voriconazole, fluconazole, ticlopidine, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, \ncarbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and chloramphenicol. \n \n\n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nProton Pump Inhibitors (PPI):  \nOmeprazole 80 mg once daily administered either at the same time as clopidogrel or with 12 hours \nbetween the administrations of the two drugs decreased the exposure of the active metabolite by 45% \n(loading dose) and 40% (maintenance dose). The decrease was associated with a 39% (loading dose) \nand 21% (maintenance dose) reduction of inhibition of platelet aggregation. Esomeprazole is expected \nto give a similar interaction with clopidogrel. \n \nInconsistent data on the clinical implications of this pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD)  \ninteraction in terms of major cardiovascular events have been reported from both observational and \nclinical studies. As a precaution, concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole should be \ndiscouraged (see section 4.4).  \n \nLess pronounced reductions of metabolite exposure has been observed with pantoprazole or \nlansoprazole. \nThe plasma concentrations of the active metabolite was 20% reduced (loading dose) and 14% reduced \n(maintenance dose) during concomitant treatment with pantoprazole 80 mg once daily. This was \nassociated with a reduction of the mean inhibition of platelet aggregation by 15% and 11%, \nrespectively. These results indicate that clopidogrel can be administered with pantoprazole. \n \n \nThere is no evidence that other medicinal products that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers \n(except cimetidine which is a CYP2C19 inhibitor) or antacids interfere with antiplatelet activity of \nclopidogrel. \n \nOther medicinal products: \nA number of other clinical studies have been conducted with clopidogrel and other concomitant \nmedicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic \ninteractions. No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel \nwas co-administered with atenolol, nifedipine, or both atenolol and nifedipine. Furthermore, the \npharmacodynamic activity of clopidogrel was not significantly influenced by the coadministration of \nphenobarbital, or oestrogen. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline were not modified by the co-administration of \nclopidogrel. Antacids did not modify the extent of clopidogrel absorption. \n \nData from the CAPRIE study indicate that phenytoin and tolbutamide which are metabolised by \nCYP2C9 can be safely co-administered with clopidogrel. \n \nApart from the specific medicinal products interaction information described above, interaction studies \nwith clopidogrel and some medicinal products commonly administered in patients with \natherothrombotic disease have not been performed. However, patients entered into clinical trials with \nclopidogrel received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including diuretics, beta blockers, \nACEI, calcium antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents \n(including insulin), antiepileptic agents, and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically \nsignificant adverse interactions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nAs no clinical data on exposure to clopidogrel during pregnancy are available, it is preferable not to \nuse clopidogrel during pregnancy as a precautionary measure. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).  \n \n\n5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nBreastfeeding \nIt is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of clopidogrel in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding should not be \ncontinued during treatment with clopidogrel. \n \nFertility \nClopidogrel was not shown to alter fertility in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nClopidogrel has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nClopidogrel has been evaluated for safety for 1 year or more. The clinically relevant adverse reactions \nobserved in the CAPRIE study are discussed below. Overall, clopidogrel 75 mg/day was comparable \nto ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE regardless of age, gender and race. In addition to clinical studies \nexperience, adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported. \n \nBleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in post-marketing \nexperience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. \n \nIn CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding \nwas 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was similar for clopidogrel and ASA. \n \nAdverse reactions that occurred either during clinical studies or that were spontaneously reported are \npresented in the table below. Their frequency is defined using the following conventions: common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare \n(< 1/10,000).

Appropriate therapy should be considered if bleedings are observed. No \nantidote to the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel has been found. If prompt correction of \nprolonged bleeding time is required, platelet transfusion may reverse the effects of clopidogrel. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin,  \nATC Code: B01AC-04.  \n \nClopidogrel is a prodrug, one of whose metabolites is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel \nmust be metabolised by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet \naggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine \ndiphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the \nglycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. Due to the irreversible \nbinding, platelets exposed are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (approximately 7 - 10 days) \nand recovery of normal platelet function occurs at a rate consistent with platelet turnover. Platelet \naggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of \nplatelet activation by released ADP. \n \nBecause the active metabolite is formed by CYP450 enzymes, some of which are polymorphic or \nsubject to inhibition by other medicinal products, not all patients will have adequate platelet inhibition. \n \nRepeated doses of 75 mg per day produced substantial inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation \nfrom the first day; this increased progressively and reached steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At \nsteady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg per day was between 40% and \n60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually returned to baseline values, generally within 5 \ndays after treatment was discontinued.  \n \nRecent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke or established peripheral arterial disease \n \nThe CAPRIE study included 19,185 patients with atherothrombosis as manifested by recent \nmyocardial infarction (< 35 days), recent ischaemic stroke (between 7 days and 6 months) or \nestablished peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients were randomised to clopidogrel 75 mg/day or \nASA 325 mg/day, and were followed for 1 to 3 years. In the myocardial infarction subgroup, most of \nthe patients received ASA for the first few days following the acute myocardial infarction.  \n \nClopidogrel significantly reduced the incidence of new ischaemic events (combined end point of \nmyocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and vascular death) when compared to ASA. In the intention \n\n8 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nto treat analysis, 939 events were observed in the clopidogrel group and 1,020 events with ASA \n(relative risk reduction (RRR) 8.7%, [95% CI: 0.2 to 16.4]; p=0.045), which corresponds, for every \n1,000 patients treated for 2 years, to 10 [CI: 0 to 20] additional patients being prevented from \nexperiencing a new ischaemic event. Analysis of total mortality as a secondary endpoint did not show \nany significant difference between clopidogrel (5.8%) and ASA (6.0%).  \n \nIn a subgroup analysis by qualifying condition (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and PAD) the \nbenefit appeared to be strongest (achieving statistical significance at p=0.003) in patients enrolled due \nto PAD (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) (RRR = 23.7%; CI: 8.9 to \n36.2) and weaker (not significantly different from ASA) in stroke patients (RRR = 7.3%; CI: -5.7 to \n18.7 [p=0.258]). In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial \ninfarction, clopidogrel was numerically inferior, but not statistically different from ASA \n(RRR = -4.0%; CI: -22.5 to 11.7 [p=0.639]). In addition, a subgroup analysis by age suggested that the \nbenefit of clopidogrel in patients over 75 years was less than that observed in patients \u226475 years.  \n \nSince the CAPRIE trial was not powered to evaluate efficacy of individual subgroups, it is not clear \nwhether the differences in relative risk reduction across qualifying conditions are real, or a result of \nchance. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn a dose escalation study of 86 neonates or infants up to 24 months of age at risk for thrombosis \n(PICOLO), clopidogrel was evaluated at consecutive doses of 0.01, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg in neonates and \ninfants and 0.15 mg/kg only in neonates. The dose of 0.2 mg/kg achieved the mean percent inhibition \nof 49.3% (5 \u00b5M ADP-induced platelet aggregation) which was comparable to that of adults taking \nPlavix 75 mg/day. \n \nIn a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study (CLARINET), 906 paediatric patients (neonates \nand infants) with cyanotic congenital heart disease palliated with a systemic-to-pulmonary arterial \nshunt were randomised to receive clopidogrel 0.2 mg/kg (n=467) or placebo (n=439) along with \nconcomitant background therapy up to the time of second stage surgery. The mean time between shunt \npalliation and first administration of study medicinal product was 20 days. Approximately 88% of \npatients received concomitant ASA (range of 1 to 23 mg/kg/day). There was no significant difference \nbetween groups in the primary composite endpoint of death, shunt thrombosis or cardiac-related \nintervention prior to 120 days of age following an event considered of thrombotic nature (89 [19.1%] \nfor the clopidogrel group and 90 [20.5%] for the placebo group) (see section 4.2). Bleeding was the \nmost frequently reported adverse reaction in both clopidogrel and placebo groups; however, there was \nno significant difference in the bleeding rate between groups. In the long-term safety follow-up of this \nstudy, 26 patients with the shunt still in place at one year of age received clopidogrel up to 18 months \nof age. No new safety concerns were noted during this long-term follow-up. \n \nThe CLARINET and the PICOLO trials were conducted using a constituted solution of clopidogrel. In \na relative bioavailability study in adults, the constituted solution of clopidogrel showed a similar extent \nand slightly higher rate of absorption of the main circulating (inactive) metabolite compared to the \nauthorised tablet. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Mean peak \nplasma levels of unchanged clopidogrel (approximately 2.2 - 2.5 ng/ml after a single 75 mg oral dose) \noccurred approximately 45 minutes after dosing. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary \nexcretion of clopidogrel metabolites. \n \n\n9 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nDistribution \nClopidogrel and the main circulating (inactive) metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma \nproteins (98% and 94% respectively). The binding is non-saturable in vitro over a wide concentration \nrange. \n \nMetabolism \nClopidogrel is extensively metabolised by the liver. In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel is metabolised \naccording to two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into \nits inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites), and one mediated by multiple \ncytochromes P450. Clopidogrel is first metabolised to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. \nSubsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the \nactive metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. In vitro, this metabolic pathway is mediated by \nCYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. The active thiol metabolite which has been isolated in \nvitro, binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation.  \n \nThe Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose \nas it is after four days of 75-mg maintenance dose. Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after \ndosing.  \n \nElimination \nFollowing an oral dose of 14C-labelled clopidogrel in man, approximately 50% was excreted in the \nurine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 120-hour interval after dosing. After a single oral \ndose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The elimination half-life of the \nmain circulating (inactive) metabolite was 8 hours after single and repeated administration. \n \nPharmacogenetics \nCYP2C19 is involved in the formation of both the active metabolite and the 2-oxo-clopidogrel \nintermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active metabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as \nmeasured by ex vivo platelet aggregation assays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype.  \n \nThe CYP2C19*1 allele corresponds to fully functional metabolism while the CYP2C19*2 and \nCYP2C19*3 alleles are nonfunctional. The CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles account for the \nmajority of reduced function alleles in Caucasian (85%)  and Asian (99%) poor metabolisers. Other \nalleles associated with absent or reduced metabolism are less frequent and include CYP2C19*4, *5, \n*6, *7, and *8. A patient with poor metaboliser status will possess two loss-of-function alleles as \ndefined above. Published frequencies for the poor CYP2C19 metaboliser genotypes are approximately \n2% for Caucasians, 4% for Blacks and 14% for Chinese. Tests are available to determine a patient\u2019s \nCYP2C19 genotype. \n \nA crossover study in 40 healthy subjects, 10 each in the four CYP2C19 metaboliser groups (ultrarapid, \nextensive, intermediate and poor), evaluated pharmacokinetic and antiplatelet responses using 300 mg \nfollowed by 75 mg/day and 600 mg followed by 150 mg/day, each for a total of 5 days (steady state). \nNo substantial differences in active metabolite exposure and mean inhibition of platelet aggregation \n(IPA) were observed between ultrarapid, extensive and intermediate metabolisers. In poor \nmetabolisers, active metabolite exposure was decreased by 63-71% compared to extensive \nmetabolisers. After the 300 mg/75 mg dose regimen, antiplatelet responses were decreased in the poor \nmetabolisers with mean IPA (5 \u03bcM ADP) of 24% (24 hours) and 37% (Day 5) as compared to IPA of \n39% (24 hours) and 58% (Day 5) in the extensive metabolisers and 37% (24 hours) and 60% (Day 5) \nin the intermediate metabolisers. When poor metabolisers received the 600 mg/150 mg regimen, active \nmetabolite exposure was greater than with the 300 mg/75 mg regimen. In addition, IPA was 32% \n(24 hours) and 61% (Day 5), which were greater than in the poor metabolisers receiving the \n300 mg/75 mg regimen, and were similar to the other CYP2C19 metaboliser groups receiving the \n300 mg/75 mg regimen. An appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been \nestablished in clinical outcome trials. \n \n\n10 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nConsistent with the above results, in a meta-analysis including 6 studies of 335 clopidogrel-treated \nsubjects at steady state, it was shown that active metabolite exposure was decreased by 28% for \nintermediate metabolisers, and 72% for poor metabolisers while platelet aggregation inhibition (5 \u03bcM \nADP) was decreased with differences in IPA of 5.9% and 21.4%, respectively, when compared to \nextensive metabolisers. \n \nThe influence of CYP2C19 genotype on clinical outcomes in patients treated with clopidogrel has not \nbeen evaluated in prospective, randomised, controlled trials. There have been a number of \nretrospective analyses, however, to evaluate this effect in patients treated with clopidogrel for whom \nthere are genotyping results: CURE (n=2721), CHARISMA (n=2428), CLARITY-TIMI 28 (n=227), \nTRITON-TIMI 38 (n=1477), and ACTIVE-A (n=601), as well as a number of published cohort \nstudies. \n \nIn TRITON-TIMI 38 and 3 of the cohort studies (Collet, Sibbing, Giusti)  the combined group of \npatients with either intermediate or poor metaboliser status had a higher rate of cardiovascular events \n(death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) or stent thrombosis compared to extensive metabolisers. \n \nIn CHARISMA and one cohort study (Simon), an increased event rate was observed only in poor \nmetabolisers when compared to extensive metabolisers. \n \nIn CURE, CLARITY, ACTIVE-A and one of the cohort studies (Trenk), no increased event rate was \nobserved based on metaboliser status. \n \nNone of these analyses were adequately sized to detect differences in outcome in poor metabolisers. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of clopidogrel is not known in these special \npopulations. \n \nRenal impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day in subjects with severe renal disease (creatinine \nclearance from 5 to 15 ml/min), inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was lower (25%) than \nthat observed in healthy subjects, however, the prolongation of bleeding time was similar to that seen \nin healthy subjects receiving 75 mg of clopidogrel per day. In addition, clinical tolerance was good in \nall patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy \nsubjects. The mean bleeding time prolongation was also similar in the two groups. \n \nRace \nThe prevalence of CYP2C19 alleles that result in intermediate and poor CYP2C19 metabolism differs \naccording to race/ethnicity (see Pharmacogenetics). From literature, limited data in Asian populations \nare available to assess the clinical implication of genotyping of this CYP on clinical outcome events. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuring non clinical studies in rat and baboon, the most frequently observed effects were liver changes. \nThese occurred at doses representing at least 25 times the exposure seen in humans receiving the \nclinical dose of 75 mg/day and were a consequence of an effect on hepatic metabolising enzymes. No \neffect on hepatic metabolising enzymes was observed in humans receiving clopidogrel at the \ntherapeutic dose. \n \nAt very high doses, a poor gastric tolerability (gastritis, gastric erosions and/or vomiting) of \nclopidogrel was also reported in rat and baboon. \n\n11 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nThere was no evidence of carcinogenic effect when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to \nmice and 104 weeks to rats when given at doses up to 77 mg/kg per day (representing at least 25 times \nthe exposure seen in humans receiving the clinical dose of 75 mg/day). \n \nClopidogrel has been tested in a range of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and showed no \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nClopidogrel was found to have no effect on the fertility of male and female rats and was not \nteratogenic in either rats or rabbits. When given to lactating rats, clopidogrel caused a slight delay in \nthe development of the offspring. Specific pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled \nclopidogrel have shown that the parent compound or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. \nConsequently, a direct effect (slight toxicity), or an indirect effect (low palatability) cannot be \nexcluded. \n \n \n6.

WHAT CLOPIDOGREL ACINO PHARMA GMBH IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nClopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH contains the active ingredient Clopidogrel which belongs to a group \nof medicines called antiplatelet medicinal products. Platelets (so-called thrombocytes) are very small \nstructures, which clump together during blood clotting. By preventing this clumping, antiplatelet \nmedicinal products reduce the chances of blood clots forming (a process called thrombosis). \n  \nClopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH is taken to prevent blood clots (thrombi) forming in hardened blood \nvessels (arteries), a process known as atherothrombosis, which can lead to atherothrombotic events \n(such as stroke, heart attack, or death). \n \nYou have been prescribed Clopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH to help prevent blood clots and reduce \nthe risk of these severe events because: \n- You have a condition of hardening of arteries (also known as atherosclerosis), and  \n- You have previously experienced a heart attack, stroke or have a condition known as \n\nperipheral arterial disease (disturbed blood flow in arms or legs caused by vascular \nocclusions) \n\n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE CLOPIDOGREL ACINO PHARMA GMBH \n \nDo not take Clopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH: \n\uf0b7 If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to clopidogrel or any of the other ingredients of \n\nClopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH; \n\uf0b7 If you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or \n\nbleeding within the brain; \n\uf0b7 If you suffer from severe liver disease; \n \nIf you think any of these apply to you, or if you are in any doubt at all, consult your doctor before \ntaking Clopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH. \n \n\n22 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nTake special care with Clopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH: \nIf any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking \nClopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH: \n\uf0b7 if you have a risk of bleeding such as \n\n-  a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer) \n-  a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, \n\norgans or joints of your body) \n-  a recent serious injury \n-  a recent surgery (including dental) \n-  a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days \n\n \n\uf0b7 if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred within the \n\nlast seven days \n\uf0b7 if you have kidney or liver disease \n \nWhile you are taking Clopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH: \n\uf0b7 You should tell your doctor if a surgery (including dental) is planned. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition (also known \n\nas Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP) that includes fever and bruising under the \nskin that may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, \nconfusion, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4 \u2018POSSIBLE SIDE \nEFFECTS\u2019). \n\n\uf0b7 If you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This is linked \nto the way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. For minor \ncuts and injuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. However, if you \nare concerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4 \n\u2018POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS\u2019). \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may order blood tests. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nClopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH is not intended for use in children or adolescents. \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.  \nSome other medicines may influence the use of Clopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH or vice versa.  \n \nYou should specifically tell your doctor if you take \n- oral anticoagulants, medicines used to reduce blood clotting, \n- a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, usually used to treat painful and/or inflammatory \n\nconditions of muscle or joints \n- heparin or any other injectable medicine used to reduce blood clotting \n- omeprazole, esomeprazole or cimetidine, medicines to treat upset stomach \n- fluconazole, voriconazole, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol, medicines to treat bacterial and \n\nfungal infections \n \n- fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, or moclobemide, medicines to treat depression \n- carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine, medicines to treat some forms of epilepsy \n- ticlopidine, other antiplatelet agent. \n \nYou should specifically tell your doctor if you take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal \nproduct, usually used to treat painful and/or inflammatory conditions of muscle or joints, or if you take \nheparin, another medicine used to reduce blood clotting.  \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever: An \noccasional use of acetylsalicylic acid (no more than 1,000 mg in any 24 hour period) should generally \nnot cause a problem, but prolonged use in other circumstances should be discussed with your doctor. \n\n23 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \nTaking Clopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH with food and drink \nClopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH may be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIt is preferable not to take this product during pregnancy. \n \nIf you are pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant, you should tell your doctor or your pharmacist \nbefore taking Clopidogrel Acino Pharma GmbH.
