CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nReplacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years) in:\n\uf02d Primary immunodeficiency syndromes with impaired antibody production (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n3\n\n\uf02d Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with chronic \nlymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), in whom prophylactic antibiotics have failed or are contra-\nindicated.\n\n\uf02d Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent infections in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.\n\uf02d Hypogammaglobulinaemia in patients, pre- and post-allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell \n\ntransplantation (HSCT).\n\nImmunomodulatory therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years):\n\uf02d Hizentra is indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating \n\npolyneuropathy (CIDP) as maintenance therapy after stabilization with IVIg.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThe dose and dose regimen are dependent on the indication.\n\nTherapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a healthcare professional \nexperienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency/CIDP with SCIg.\n\nPosology\nAdults and children (0-18 years)\n\nReplacement therapy\nThe medicinal product should be administered via the subcutaneous route.\n\nIn replacement therapy the dose may need to be individualised for each patient dependent on the \nclinical response and serum IgG trough levels. The following dose regimens are given as a guideline.\n\nThe dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG (measured before the next infusion) of at least \n5 to 6 g/l and aim to be within the reference interval of serum IgG for age. A loading dose of at least \n0.2 to 0.5 g/kg (1.0 to 2.5 ml/kg) body weight may be required. This may need to be divided over \nseveral days. After steady state IgG levels have been attained, maintenance doses are administered at \nrepeated intervals to reach a cumulative monthly dose of the order of 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg (2.0 to 4.0 ml/kg) \nbody weight. Each single dose may need to be injected at different anatomic sites.\n\nTrough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the patient\u2019s clinical response. \nDepending on the clinical response (e.g. infection rate), adjustment of the dose and/or the dose interval \nmay be considered in order to aim for higher trough levels.\n\nImmunomodulatory therapy in CIDP\nThe therapy with Hizentra is initiated 1 week after the last IVIg infusion. The recommended \nsubcutaneous dose is 0.2 to 0.4 g/kg body weight per week administered in 1 or 2 sessions over 1 or 2 \nconsecutive days. The initial subcutaneous dose may be a 1:1 conversion from the previous IVIG dose \n(calculated as weekly dose). \nExample a 1g/kg IVIG dose given every 3 weeks would convert into a 0.33g/kg weekly Hizentra dose.\nThe weekly dose can be divided into smaller doses and administered by desired number of times per \nweek. For dosing every two weeks, double the weekly Hizentra dose.\n\nThe dose may need to be adapted to achieve the desired clinical response. Patient`s individual clinical \nresponse should be the primary consideration in dose adjustment. In case of clinical deterioration the \ndose may be increased to the recommended maximum of 0.4g/kg weekly dose.\nHizentra maintenance therapy in CIDP has not been studied for periods longer than 18 months. \nIndividualize the duration of any treatment beyond 18 months based upon the patient\u2019s response and \ndemonstrated need for continued therapy.\n\n\n\n4\n\nEfficacy of Hizentra has been demonstrated over placebo after switching from intravenous \nimmunoglobulins (IVIG). Direct comparative data for Hizentra versus IVIG are not available. Please \nrefer also to section 5.1.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe posology in children and adolescents (0-18 years) is not different to that of adults as the posology \nfor each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome in replacement \ntherapy indications.\n\nHizentra was evaluated in 68 paediatric subjects with PID aged 2 to <12 years and in 57 adolescents\naged 12 to <18 years. No paediatric-specific dose requirements were necessary to achieve the desired \nserum IgG levels. Hizentra has not been evaluated in clinical studies in paediatric patients with CIDP \nwho are under the age of 18.\n\nElderly population\nAs the dose is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the above mentioned \nconditions, the dose in the elderly population is not considered to be different from that in subjects 18 \nto 65 years of age.\nIn clinical studies Hizentra was evaluated in 13 subjects with PID >65 years of age and no specific \ndose adjustments were necessary to achieve the desired serum IgG levels.\nIn clinical studies Hizentra was evaluated in 61 subjects with CIDP >65 years of age and no specific \ndose adjustments were necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor subcutaneous use only.\n\nHome-treatment\nSubcutaneous infusion for home treatment must be initiated and monitored by a healthcare \nprofessional experienced in the guidance of patients for home treatment. Infusion devices appropriate \nfor subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulins can be used. The patient or a caregiver must be \ninstructed in the use of infusion devices, the keeping of treatment diary, recognition of and measures \nto be taken in case of severe adverse reactions.\n\nHizentra may be infused into sites such as abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and / or lateral hip.\nMore than one infusion device can be used simultaneously. The amount of product infused into a \nparticular site may vary. In infants and children, infusion site may be changed every 5-15 ml. In adults \ndoses may be given up to 50 ml/site. There is no limit to the number of infusion sites. Infusion sites \nshould be at least 5 cm apart.\n\nInfusion rate\nHizentra can be infused using:\n\n\uf0b7 an infusion device, or\n\n\uf0b7 by manual push with a syringe.\n\nThe recommended initial infusion rate depends on the individual patient\u2019s needs.\n\nDevice-assisted infusion\nThe initial infusion rate should not exceed 20 ml/hour/site.\nIf well-tolerated (see also section 4.4), the infusion rate can then gradually be increased to \n35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. Thereafter, if the patient tolerates the initial infusions \nat the full dose per site and maximum rate, an increase in the infusion rate of successive infusions may \nbe considered at the discretion of the patient and based on the healthcare professionals\u2019 judgement.\n\nManual push infusion\n\n\n\n5\n\nThe recommended initial infusion rate should not exceed 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site).\nIf well-tolerated (see also section 4.4), the infusion rate can be increased up to 2.0 ml/min/site\n(120 ml/hour/site). Thereafter, if the patient tolerates the initial infusions at the full dose per site and \nmaximum rate, an increase in the infusion rate of successive infusions may be considered at the \ndiscretion of the patient and based on the healthcare professionals\u2019 judgement.\n\nA 24 or larger (i.e. lower gauge number) needle gauge may be required to allow patients to infuse at \nhigher flow rates. Using smaller needles (i.e. higher gauge number) may make it more difficult to \nmanually push Hizentra. Only one infusion site per syringe can be infused. If administration with an \nadditional Hizentra syringe is required, a new sterile injection needle should be used and the infusion \nsite changed.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section \n4.4).\nPatients with hyperprolinaemia type I or II.\nHizentra must not be given intravascularly.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nHizentra is for subcutaneous use only. If Hizentra is accidentally administered into a blood vessel, \npatients could develop shock.\n\nThe recommended infusion rate given under section 4.2 should be adhered to. Patients should be \nclosely monitored and carefully observed for any adverse events throughout the infusion period.\n\nCertain adverse reactions may occur more frequently in patients who receive human normal \nimmunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when the human normal immunoglobulin product \nis switched or when treatment has been stopped for more than eight weeks.\n\nPotential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients:\n\uf02d are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin, by initially injecting the product slowly \n\n(see section 4.2);\n\uf02d are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients \n\nna\u00efve to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative product or when \nthere has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored during the first \ninfusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect potential adverse \nreactions.\n\nAll other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after administration.\n\nSuspicion of allergic or anaphylactic type reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the \ninjection. In case of shock, standard medical treatment should be administered.\n\nHypersensitivity\nTrue allergic reactions are rare. They can particularly occur in patients with anti-IgA antibodies who \nshould be treated with particular caution. Patients with anti-IgA antibodies, in whom treatment with \nsubcutaneous IgG products remains the only option, should be switched to Hizentra only under close \nmedical supervision.\nRarely, human normal immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic reaction, \neven in patients who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin.\n\n\n\n6\n\nThromboembolism\nArterial and venous thromboembolic events including myocardial infarction, stroke, deep venous \nthrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been associated with the use of immunoglobulins. Caution \nshould be exercised in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events (such as advanced \nage, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic episodes, patients\nwith acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods of immobilization, \nseverely hypovolemic patients, patients with diseases which increase blood viscosity). Patients should \nbe informed about first symptoms of thromboembolic events including shortness of breath, pain and \nswelling of a limb, focal neurological deficits and chest pain and should be advised to contact their \nphysician immediately upon onset of symptoms. Patients should be sufficiently hydrated before use of \nimmunoglobulins.\n\nAseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)\n\nAMS has been reported with use of IVIg or SCIg. The syndrome usually begins within several hours \n\nto 2 days following immune globulin treatment. AMS is characterised by the following signs and \n\nsymptoms: severe headache, neck stiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nPatients exhibiting signs and symptoms of AMS should receive a thorough neurological examination, \n\nincluding CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. Discontinuation of immunoglobulin \n\ntreatment may result in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.\n\nInformation on safety with respect to transmissible agents\nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.\n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV and \nfor the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19.\n\nThere is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 \ntransmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an \nimportant contribution to the viral safety.\n\nInterference with serological testing\nAfter infusion of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in \nthe patient's blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing.\n\nPassive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D may interfere with some \nserological tests for red cell allo-antibodies (Coombs\u2019 test).\n\nSodium content\nHizentra is essentially sodium free.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe same warnings and precautions apply to the paediatric population.\n\nElderly population\nThe same warnings and precautions apply to the elderly population.\n\n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nLive attenuated virus vaccines\n\n\n\n7\n\nImmunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the \nefficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After \nadministration of this medicinal product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with \nlive attenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. \nTherefore patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe same interactions may occur in the paediatric population.\n\nElderly population\nThe same interactions may occur in the elderly population.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nData from prospective clinical trials on the use of human normal immunoglobulin in pregnant women \nis limited. Therefore, Hizentra should only be given with caution to pregnant women. Clinical \nexperience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy, or on \nthe foetus or the neonate are to be expected.\nContinued treatment of the pregnant woman ensures a passive immunity for the neonate.\n\nBreast-feeding\nData from prospective clinical trials on the use of human normal immunoglobulin in breast feeding\nwomen is limited. Therefore, Hizentra should only be given with caution to breast-feeding mothers.\nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests however that no harmful effects on the neonate \nare to be expected. Immunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may contribute to the transfer of \nprotective antibodies to the neonate.\n\nFertility\nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be \nexpected.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThe ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions associated with \nHizentra. Patients who experience adverse reactions during treatment should wait for these to resolve \nbefore driving or operating machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of safety profile\nAdverse reactions such as chills, headache, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low \nblood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally.\n\nRarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and in isolated \ncases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous \nadministration.\n\nLocal reactions at infusion sites: swelling, soreness, redness, induration, local heat, itching, bruising \nand rash.\n\nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse Reactions (ARs) have been collected in Hizentra clinical trials from 7 phase III studies in \npatients with primary immunodeficiency (n = 231), 2 phase IV studies in patients with PID (n=74), 1\n\n\n\n8\n\nphase III study (n = 115), and 1 extension study (n = 82) in patients with CIDP (total N = 502 patients; \n26,646 infusions). The ADRs reported in these clinical studies are summarised and categorised \naccording to the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC and Preferred Term level) and frequency below.\n\nFrequency per patient or per infusion has been evaluated using the following criteria: Very common \n(\u22651/10), Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nVery rare (<1/10,000). For spontaneous post-marketing ADRs, the reporting frequency is categorised \nas unknown.\n\nFrequency of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) associated with Hizentra obtained from clinical \nstudies and post-marketing surveillance, reporting rate per patient or per infusion\n\nSystem Organ \nClass\n(SOC, MedDRA)\n\nADRs (MedDRA Preferred Term, PT) ADR frequency \ncategory per patient\n\nADR frequency \ncategory per \n\ninfusion\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity Uncommon Rare\nAnaphylactic reaction Unknown Unknown\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nHeadache Very common Uncommon\nDizziness, Migraine Common Rare\nTremor (including Psychomotor \nhyperactivity)\n\nUncommon Rare\n\nMeningitis aseptic Uncommon Very rare\nBurning sensation Unknown Unknown\n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia Uncommon Very rare\nVascular disorders Hypertension Common Rare\n\nFlushing Uncommon Rare\nEmbolic and thrombotic events Unknown Unknown\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nDiarrhoea, Abdominal pain Common Uncommon\nNausea, Vomiting Common Rare\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash Very common Uncommon\nPruritus, Urticaria Common Rare\n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders\n\nMusculoskeletal pain, Arthralgia Common Uncommon\n\nMuscle spasm, Muscular weakness Uncommon Rare\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions\n\nInfusion site reaction Very common Very common\n\nFatigue (including Malaise), Pyrexia Common Uncommon\n\nChest pain, Influenza like illness, Pain Common Rare\n\nChills (including Hypothermia) Uncommon Rare\n\nInfusion site ulcer Unknown Unknown\n\nInvestigations Blood creatinine increased Uncommon Rare\n\n\n\n9\n\nPaediatric population\nClinical trials with Hizentra showed a similar overall safety profile in paediatric and adult patients \nwith PID.\nHizentra was not evaluated in clinical studies in paediatric patients with CIDP who were under the age \nof 18.\n\nElderly population\nThe same adverse reactions may occur in the elderly population. Information available from clinical \ntrials showed no difference in the safety profile of patients \u2265 65 years of age than of younger patients.\nPostmarketing experience with Hizentra in patients \u2265 65 years of age shows an overall similar safety \nprofile in this age group as in younger patients.\nPlease refer to section 4.4 for details on risk factors and monitoring recommendations.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.\nHealthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nConsequences of an overdose are not known.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, \nfor extravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA01.\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of \nantibodies against infectious agents.\nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is \nusually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1,000 donors. It has a distribution of \nimmunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma. \n\nMechanism of action\nIn immunodeficiency, adequate doses of Hizentra may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G \nantibody levels to the normal range and thus help against infections.\nThe mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but \nincludes immunomodulatory effects.\n\nPID\nIn the European pivotal prospective open label, single arm and multicentre study, a total of 51 subjects \nwith primary immunodeficiency syndromes aged between 3 and 60 years old were treated with \nHizentra for up to 41 weeks. The mean dose administered each week was 0.12 g/kg body weight (bw). \nSustained IgG trough levels with mean concentrations of 7.99 \u2013 8.25 g/l were thereby achieved \nthroughout the treatment period. Subjects received in total 1,831 weekly Hizentra infusions.\n\nIn the US prospective open label, single arm and multicentre study, a total of 49 subjects with primary \nimmunodeficiency syndromes aged between 5 and 72 years old were treated with Hizentra for up to \n15 months. The mean dose administered each week was 0.23 g/kg bw. Sustained IgG trough levels \nwith a mean concentration of 12.53 g/l were thereby achieved throughout the treatment period. \nSubjects received in total 2,264 weekly Hizentra infusions.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10\n\nNo serious bacterial infections were reported during the efficacy period in subjects receiving Hizentra \nduring clinical studies.\n\nTo assess the safety and tolerability of higher infusion rates applied via the manual push and pump-\nassisted administration, 49 PID subjects aged 2 to 75 years were enrolled in an open-label, multicentre, \nparallel-arm, nonrandomised phase IV HILO (Hizentra Label Optimization) study and treated with \nHizentra for at least 12 weeks (11 paediatric patients aged 2 to <18, 35 adult patients aged 18 to 65, \nand 3 geriatric patients aged >65 years). In the first patient group receiving Hizentra via the manual \npush technique (n=16), 2 to 7 infusions per week were administered with the flow rates of 30, 60 and \n120 ml/hour/site (see section 4.2). In the second patient group receiving Hizentra via pump-assisted \nadministration (n=18), weekly Hizentra infusions were administered with 25, 50, 75 and 100 \nml/hour/site flow rate. In a third group, infusion volumes of 25, 40 and 50ml per site were additionally \nevaluated in pump-assisted administration of weekly Hizentra doses (n=15). In all three groups, each \ninfusion parameter was used for 4 weeks, after which subjects successfully completing required \nminimal number of valid infusions could switch to the next higher infusion parameter.\nThe primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects responding to a higher infusion parameter:\n\nGroup Infusion parameter and responder rate (%)\n1. manual push\n\nflow rates\n30 ml/hour/site 60 ml/hour/site 120 \n\nml/hour/site\n-\n\n100.0 % 100.0 % 87.5 % -\n2. pump-assisted\n\nflow rates\n25 ml/hour/site 50 ml/hour/site 75 ml/hour/site 100 ml/hour/site\n77.8 % 77.8 % 66.7 % 61.1 %\n\n3. pump-assisted\nvolumes\n\n25 ml/site 40 ml/site 50 ml/site -\n86.7 % 73.3 % 73.3 % -\n\nResponder: in the pump-assisted group a subject who performed \u22653 valid infusions out of 4 for an infusion \nparameter; in the manual push group a subject who performed \u226560 % of valid infusions for an infusion \nparameter. An infusion was considered valid, if \u226595 % of the planned flow rate/volume per \u22651 infusion site \nwas achieved.\n\nOverall, the number of infusions without severe local reactions versus the total number of infusions\n(tolerability) was \u2265 0.98 in all groups for all infusion parameters. No clinically relevant differences in \nthe serum IgG trough concentrations were observed between the baseline at day 1 and the end of the \nstudy in all subjects.\n\nCIDP\nThe safety, efficacy and tolerability of Hizentra in patients with CIDP has been assessed in a \nmulticentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase III PATH \n[Polyneuropathy and Treatment with Hizentra] study. 172 adults with definite or probable CIDP who \nwere previously treated with and responded to IVIg were randomised to weekly 0.2 g/kg bw Hizentra, \nweekly 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra or placebo groups, and followed for a subsequent 24 weeks. The mean \nduration of exposure was 118.9 days in the 0.2 g/kg bw and 129 days in the 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra \ngroup (maximum exposure up to 167 and 166 days in each group, respectively). Subjects generally \nused 4 infusion sites in parallel (up to 8 sites in parallel). In total, 57 subjects received 1514 infusions \nin the placebo group, 57 subjects received 2007 infusions in the 0.2 g/kg bw Hizentra group, and 58 \nsubjects received 2218 infusions in the 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra group (in total 5739 infusions).\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects who had a CIDP relapse (defined as a \u2265 \n1 point increase in adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment [INCAT] score compared \nwith baseline) or were withdrawn for any other reason in the Hizentra treatment period.\nBoth Hizentra doses demonstrated superiority over placebo for the primary endpoint. A statistically \nsignificant lower percentage of subjects treated with Hizentra, 32.8 % for 0.4 g/kg bw and 38.6 % for \n0.2 g/kg bw, had CIDP relapse or was withdrawn for other reasons compared with 63.2 % subjects \ntreated with placebo (p < 0.001 or p = 0.007, respectively). When only considering relapse, the CIDP \nrelapse rates were 19.0 % for 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra and 33.3 % for 0.2 g/kg bw Hizentra compared \nwith 56.1 % for placebo (p < 0.001 or p = 0.012, respectively). Accordingly, over the treatment period \n\n\n\n11\n\nfor up to 24 weeks Hizentra prevented relapse in 81 % and 67 % of subjects in the 0.4 g/kg bw and 0.2 \ng/kg bw group, respectively, while in the placebo group 44 % of subjects remained relapse-free.\n\nTime to CIDP relapse (Figure 1) was evaluated, and the corresponding probabilities for CIDP relapse \nbased on Kaplan-Meier estimates were: placebo, 58.8 %; 0.2 /kg bw Hizentra, 35.0 %; and 0.4 g/kg \nbw Hizentra, 22.4 %. The hazard ratios (95 % CI) for the lower dose and higher dose compared to \nplacebo was 0.48 (0.27, 0.85) and 0.25 (0.12, 0.49), respectively.\nThe difference observed between the 0.2 g/kg bw and the 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra groups did not reach \nstatistical significance.\n\nFigure 1. Kaplan-Meier Plot Time to CIDP Relapse\n\nIn the efficacy scores (INCAT score, mean grip strength, and Medical Research Council sum score), \nsubjects in both Hizentra dose groups remained stable while subjects in the placebo group \ndeteriorated. Subjects in the high dose Hizentra group remained stable in the Rasch-built Overall \nDisability Scale (R-ODS) centile score. Subjects in both Hizentra dose groups remained stable in \nelectrophysiology parameters.\n\nA phase III, multicentre, 48-week open-label extension study enrolled 82 CIDP patients from the \nPATH study. The extension study investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of Hizentra \nmaintenance therapy in the two weekly doses, 0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg bw. Due to the study design, the \nsame subject could receive both doses during the study; 72 subjects received doses of 0.4 g/kg and 73 \nsubjects received doses of 0.2 g/kg during the efficacy evaluation period. The mean efficacy \nevaluation period was 125.8 days (range: 1-330) in the 0.2 g/kg, and 196.1 days (range: 1-330) in the \n0.4 g/kg bw group. Patients who completed the pivotal PATH study without relapse on 0.4 g/kg bw \ndose and initially received this dose in the extension study had a relapse rate of 5.6 % (1/18 patients). \nFor all patients who received 0.4 g/kg bw in the PATH extension study, 9.7 % (7/72 patients) had a \nrelapse. Patients who completed the PATH study without relapse on 0.2 g/kg bw dose and initially \nreceived this dose in the extension study had a relapse rate of 50 % (3/6 patients). For all patients who \nreceived 0.2 g/kg bw in the extension study, 47.9 % (35/73 patients) had a relapse. Down-titrating \n\n\n\n12\n\npatients in the extension study who completed the PATH study on either dose from 0.4 g/kg to 0.2 \ng/kg bw dose was possible in 67.9 % of subjects (19/28 patients) without occurrence of relapse; all of \nthe 9 relapsers recovered within 4 weeks after treatment with 0.4 g/kg bw dose. Grip strength, MRC \nsum score, and R-ODS centile score remained stable as compared to baseline for patients who never \nhad a relapse in the extension study.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and effectiveness of Hizentra have been established in paediatric subjects 2 to 18 years of \nage. Hizentra was evaluated in 68 paediatric subjects with PID 2 to <12 years of age and in 57 \npaediatric subjects 12 to <18 years of age. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics, safety \nand efficacy profiles as compared with adult subjects. No paediatric-specific dose adjustments were \nnecessary to achieve the desired serum IgG levels. No differences were seen in the pharmacodynamic \nproperties between adult and paediatric study patients with PID. \nHizentra has not been evaluated in clinical studies in paediatric patients with CIDP who are under the \nage of 18.\n\nElderly population\nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between PID subjects >65 years and PID \nsubjects 18 to 65 years of age. In the clinical studies Hizentra was evaluated in 13 patients with PID \n>65 years of age.\nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between CIDP subjects >65 years and CIDP \nsubjects 18 to 65 years of age. In the clinical studies with CIDP patients, 61 subjects >65 years of age \nwere treated with Hizentra.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and Distribution\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of Hizentra, peak serum levels are achieved after \napproximately 2 days.\n\nElimination\nIgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system.\n\nPID\nIn a clinical phase III trial with Hizentra (n = 46), the subjects achieved sustained trough levels \n(median 8.1 g/l) over a period of 29 weeks when receiving median weekly doses of 0.06 to \n0.24 g/kgbw.\n\nSimulations by empirical Population Pharmacokinetic models suggested that comparable IgG \nexposure levels (AUC0-14days, Cmin 14days) may be obtained if Hizentra is administered subcutaneously \nevery two weeks using double the weekly dose during maintenance therapy.\nThese simulations further suggested that comparable serum IgG trough levels can be achieved when \nthe weekly maintenance dose of Hizentra is administered in proportional amounts more frequently \nthan once a week (e.g. 2 times per week, 3 times per week, 5 times per week or daily).\n\nSimulation of 2-3 missed daily doses resulted in a median serum IgG level decrease of \u2264 4% compared \nto consistent daily dosing. By replacing the missed doses when daily dosing was resumed, the median \nconcentration profile recovered within 2 to 3 days. However, if missed doses were not replaced when \ndosing was resumed, it took up to 5-6 weeks for the IgG trough levels to return to steady-state.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo differences were seen in the pharmacokinetic parameters between adult and paediatric PID study \npatients.\n\n\n\n13\n\nElderly population\nNo overall differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between PID subjects >65 \nyears and subjects 18 to 65 years of age.\n\nCIDP\nIn the PATH study, subjects (n = 172) achieved sustained trough levels over a period of 24 weeks \nwhen receiving weekly doses of 0.2 g/kg bw and 0.4 g/kg bw, respectively. The mean (SD) IgG trough \nconcentration after Hizentra treatment in the 0.4 g/kg bw group was 20.4 (3.24) g/l and 15.4 (3.06) g/l \nin the 0.2 g/kg bw group. Simulations with population-pharmacokinetic models in the PATH study \nsuggest that a comparable IgG exposure (Cmax, AUC0-14days, Cmin, 14 days) is achieved when the \ndouble weekly Hizentra dose is administered every two weeks in the CIDP subjects. These simulations \nfurther suggest that a comparable IgG exposure is correspondingly achieved when the weekly \nmaintenance dose of Hizentra is divided in several, more frequent doses (2 to 7 times per week) in the \nCIDP patients` population.\n\nPaediatric population\nHizentra has not been evaluated in clinical studies in paediatric patients with CIDP who are under the \nage of 18.\n\nElderly population\nNo overall differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between CIDP subjects >65 \nyears and subjects 18 to 65 years of age.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nImmunoglobulins are a normal constituent of the human body. L-proline is a physiological, non-\nessential amino acid.\n\nThe safety of Hizentra has been assessed in several preclinical studies, with particular reference to the \nexcipient L-proline. Non-clinical data reveal no special risk for humans based on safety pharmacology \nand toxicity studies.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n\uf02d If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or healthcare professional.\n\uf02d This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.\n\nIt may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\uf02d If you get any side effects talk to your healthcare professional. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Hizentra is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Hizentra\n3. How to use Hizentra\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Hizentra\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Hizentra is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Hizentra is\nHizentra belongs to the class of medicines called human normal immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins \nare also known as antibodies and are blood proteins that help your body to fight infections.\n\nHow Hizentra works\nHizentra contains immunoglobulins that have been prepared from the blood of healthy people. \nImmunoglobulins are produced by human body\u2019s immune system. They help your body to fight \ninfections caused by bacteria and viruses or maintain the balance in your immune system (referred to \nas immunomodulation). The medicine works in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins \nnaturally present in your blood.\n\nWhat Hizentra is used for\nReplacement therapy\nHizentra is used to raise abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels\n(replacement therapy). The medicine is used in adults and children (0-18 years) in the following\nsituations:\n\n1. Treatment of patients who are born with a reduced ability or inability to produce \nimmunoglobulins (primary immunodeficiencies). This includes conditions such as:\n\uf0b7 low immunoglobulin levels (hypogammaglobulinaemia) or absence of immunoglobulins \n\n(agammaglobulinaemia) in the blood\n\uf0b7 combination of low immunoglobulin levels, frequent infections and inability to produce \n\nadequate amounts of antibodies after vaccination (common variable immunodeficiency)\n\uf0b7 combination of low level or absence of immunoglobulins and absence or non-functional \n\nimmune cells (severe combined immunodeficiency)\n\uf0b7 lack of certain immunoglobulin G subclasses causing recurrent infections.\n\n2. Treatment of low immunoglobulin levels and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with\nchronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), a certain kind of blood cancer, where prophylactic \nantibiotics have failed or are contra-indicated.\n\n\n\n31\n\n3. Treatment of low immunoglobulin levels and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with \nmultiple myeloma (MM), another kind of blood cancer.\n\n4. Treatment of low immunoglobulin levels in patients pre- and post- allogeneic haematopoietic \nstem cell transplantation (HSCT).\n\nImmunomodulatory therapy in CIDP patients\nHizentra is also used in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a \nform of autoimmune disease. CIDP is characterised by chronic inflammation of the peripheral nerves \nthat causes muscle weakness and/or numbness mainly in the legs and arms. It is believed that the \nbody\u2019s defense attack underlines such inflammation, and the immunoglobulins present in Hizentra \nhelp to protect the nerves from being attacked (immunomodulatory therapy).\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Hizentra\n\nDo NOT infuse Hizentra\n\u25ba if you are allergic to human immunoglobulins, polysorbate 80 or L-proline.\n\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have experienced an\nintolerance against one of these components earlier.\n\n\u25ba if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (a genetic disorder causing high levels of the amino acid \nproline in the blood).\n\n\u25ba into a blood vessel.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\uf0e8 Talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using Hizentra.\n\nYou may be allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins without knowing it. However, true allergic \nreactions are rare. They may occur even if you received human immunoglobulins previously and \ntolerated them well. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough of the immunoglobulin type\nA (IgA) in your blood (IgA deficiency).\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have an immunoglobulin \n\ntype A (IgA) deficiency. Hizentra contains residual amounts of IgA which might cause an\nallergic reaction.\n\nIn these rare cases allergic reactions, such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock may occur (see \nalso section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d).\n\uf0e8 If you notice such signs during the infusion of Hizentra, stop the infusion and contact your \n\ndoctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately. \n\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor if you have a history of heart or blood vessel disease or blood clots, have thick \nblood, or have been immobile for some time. These things may increase your risk of having a blood \nclot after using Hizentra. Also tell your doctor what drugs you are using, as some drugs, such as those \nthat contain the hormone estrogen (for example, birth control pills), may increase your risk of \ndeveloping a blood clot. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience signs and symptoms such \nas shortness of breath, chest pain, pain and swelling of a limb, weakness or numbness on one side of \nthe body after receiving Hizentra.\n\n\uf0e8 Contact your doctor if you experience the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, neck \nstiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting after receiving Hizentra. Your doctor \nwill decide if further tests are necessary and whether Hizentra should be continued.\n\nYour healthcare professional will avoid potential complications by ensuring:\n\u25ba that you are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin.\n\nThe medicine must be infused slowly at first. The recommended infusion rate given under \nsection 3 \u201cHow to use Hizentra\u201d must be closely followed.\n\n\n\n32\n\n\u25ba that you are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period, especially if:\n\uf0b7 you receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time\n\uf0b7 you have switched from a different medicine\n\uf0b7 there has been a long interval (more than eight weeks) since the previous infusion.\nIn these cases, it is recommended that you are monitored during the first infusion and for an \nhour afterwards. If the points above do not apply for you it is recommended that you are \nobserved for at least 20 minutes after administration.\n\nOther medicines and Hizentra\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are using, have recently used or might use any \n\nother medicines.\n\uf0e8 You must not mix other medicines with Hizentra.\n\uf0e8 Tell your vaccinating doctor prior to a vaccination about your treatment with Hizentra.\n\nHizentra may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and \nchicken pox. Therefore, after receiving this medicine you may have to wait up to 3 months \nbefore receiving your live-attenuated vaccine. In the case of measles vaccinations the \nimpairment may persist for up to 1 year.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are \n\nbreast-feeding. Your doctor will decide whether you can receive Hizentra during your \npregnancy or while you are breast-feeding.\n\nNo clinical studies have been performed with Hizentra in pregnant women. However, medicines that \ncontain immunoglobulins have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women for years, and no \nharmful effects on the course of pregnancy or on the baby have been observed.\n\nIf you are breast-feeding and receive Hizentra, the immunoglobulins of the medicine can also be found\nin the breast milk. Therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections.\n\nDriving and using machines\nPatients may experience effects, such as dizziness or nausea, during treatment with Hizentra that might \naffect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should not drive or use machines until \nthese effects have disappeared.\n\nHizentra contains proline\nYou must not take it if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (see also section 2 \u201cWhat you need to know \nbefore you use Hizentra\u201d). Please tell your doctor prior to treatment.\n\nOther important information about Hizentra\nBlood tests\nAfter receiving Hizentra, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be impaired for a \ncertain time.\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor about your treatment with Hizentra prior to any blood test.\n\nInformation on what Hizentra is made of\nHizentra is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood). When medicines are \nmade from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being \npassed on to patients. These include:\n\uf0b7 careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \n\nare excluded, and\n\uf0b7 the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections.\nManufacturers of these medicines also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can \ninactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also \napplies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.\n\n\n\n33\n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV, the AIDS virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (liver inflammation), and for the \nnon-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19.\n\n\uf0e8 It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Hizentra the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used (see section \n3 \u201cHow to use Hizentra\u201d).\n\n3. How to use Hizentra\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure.\n\nDosage\nYour doctor will calculate the correct dose for you taking into account your weight and response to \ntreatment.\nThe dose or dosing interval should not be changed without consulting your doctor.\nIf you think you should receive Hizentra more or less frequently, please speak to your doctor.\nIf you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\nReplacement therapy\nYour doctor will determine whether you need a loading dose (for adults and children) of at least 1 to \n2.5 ml/kg of body weight divided over several days. Following this, maintenance doses may be given\nat repeated intervals, from daily to once every two weeks, to reach a cumulative monthly dose of about \n2 to 4 ml/kg of body weight. Your healthcare professional may adjust the dose based on your response \nto the treatment.\n\nImmunomodulatory therapy\nYour doctor will initiate therapy with Hizentra 1 week after your last intravenous immunoglobulin \ninfusion by administrating under the skin (subcutaneously) with a weekly dose of 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg of \nbody weight. Your doctor will determine your weekly Hizentra dose. The weekly maintenance doses \nmay be divided into smaller doses and administered as often as required during the week. For dosing \nevery two weeks, your doctor will double the weekly Hizentra dose. Your healthcare professional may \nadjust the dose based on your response to the treatment.\n\nMethod and route of administration\nIn case of home treatment, this will be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the \ntreatment of immunodeficiency/CIDP with SCIg and in the guidance of patients for home treatment.\n\nYou will be instructed in:\n\uf0b7 aseptic infusion techniques\n\uf0b7 the keeping of a treatment diary, and\n\uf0b7 measures to be taken in case of severe side effects.\n\nInfusion site(s)\n\uf0b7 Administer Hizentra under the skin only.\n\uf0b7 You may infuse Hizentra into sites such as abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and lateral hip. If large \n\ndoses are given (> 50 ml), try to administer them at multiple sites.\n\uf0b7 You may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously. Injection sites should be at least \n\n5 cm apart.\n\uf0b7 In the case, you will use a device-assisted infusion technique (e.g. pump-assisted infusion), \n\nmore than one infusion device can be used simultaneously.\n\n\n\n34\n\n\uf0b7 In the case, you will use the manual push infusion technique with a syringe, you may use only \none infusion site per syringe. If you need to administer an additional Hizentra syringe, you must \nuse a new sterile injection needle and change the infusion site.\n\n\uf0b7 The volume of product infused into a particular site may vary.\n\nInfusion rate(s)\nYour doctor will determine the appropriate infusion technique and the infusion rate for you taking into \naccount your individual dose, dosing frequency and product tolerability.\n\nDevice-assisted infusion:\nThe recommended initial infusion rate is up to 20 ml/hour/site. If well-tolerated, you may gradually \nincrease the infusion rate to 35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. Thereafter, the infusion \nrate can be increased further as per your tolerability.\n\nManual push infusion:\nThe recommended initial infusion rate is up to 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site). If well-tolerated, you \nmay increase the infusion rate up to 2.0 ml/min/site (120 ml/hour/site) for subsequent infusions.\nThereafter, the infusion rate can be increased further as per your tolerability.\n\nInstructions for use\n\nFollow the steps below and use aseptic technique to administer Hizentra.\n1 Clean surface\n\nThoroughly clean a table or other flat surface using an antiseptic wipe.\n2 Assemble supplies\n\nPlace Hizentra and other supplies and equipment needed for the infusion on a clean, flat surface.\n3 Thoroughly wash and dry hands\n4 Check Vials\n\nVisually inspect Hizentra for particles in the solution or discoloration as well as expiry date before \nadministering Hizentra. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or contain particles. Do not use \nsolutions that have been frozen. Administer solution which is at room or body temperature.\nOnce a vial has been opened, use the solution immediately.\n\n5 Preparation of Hizentra for infusion\n\nClean the vial stopper \u2013 Remove the protective cap from the vial \nto expose the central portion of the rubber stopper. Clean the \nstopper with an alcohol wipe or antiseptic preparation and allow it \nto dry.\n\nTransfer Hizentra to syringe for infusion \u2013 Attach a transfer \ndevice or needle to a sterile syringe, using aseptic technique. If \nusing a transfer device (vented spike), follow the instructions \nprovided by the device manufacturer. If using a needle, pull back \non the plunger to draw air into the syringe that is comparable to \nthe amount of Hizentra to be withdrawn. Then, insert the needle \ninto the center of the vial stopper and, to avoid foaming, inject air \ninto headspace of the vial (not into the liquid). Finally, withdraw \nthe desired volume of Hizentra. When using multiple vials to \nachieve the desired dose, repeat this step.\n\n6 Prepare the tubing\nAttach the administration tubing or needle set to the syringe. Prime the tubing to eliminate all \nremaining air.\n\n\n\n35\n\n7 Prepare infusion site(s)\nSelect the infusion site(s) \u2013 The number and location of infusion\nsites depends on the volume of the total dose. Each infusion site \nshould be at least 5 cm apart.\nYou may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously.\n\nClean the infusion site(s) using an antiseptic skin preparation, \nAllow each site to dry before proceeding.\n\n8 Insert the needle\nGrasp the skin between 2 fingers and insert the needle into the \nsubcutaneous tissue.\n\nSecure the needle to the skin \u2013 If necessary, use gauze and tape or \ntransparent dressing to hold the needle in place.\n\n9 Infuse Hizentra\nStart infusion.\nIf using an infusion pump, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n10 Record the infusion\nRecord the following data in your treatment diary:\n\u2022 the date of administration,\n\u2022 the batch number of the medicine, and\n\u2022 the infused volume, flow rate, the number and location of infusion sites.\n\n11 Clean up\nDiscard any unused product and all used administration supplies after administration in accordance \nwith local requirements.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask your doctor or healthcare \nprofessional.\n\nIf you use more Hizentra than you should\nIf you think you have had too much Hizentra, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to use Hizentra\nIf you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n4.

What you need to know before you use Hizentra\n3. How to use Hizentra\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Hizentra\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Hizentra is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Hizentra is\nHizentra belongs to the class of medicines called human normal immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins \nare also known as antibodies and are blood proteins that help your body to fight infections.\n\nHow Hizentra works\nHizentra contains immunoglobulins that have been prepared from the blood of healthy people. \nImmunoglobulins are produced by human body\u2019s immune system. They help your body to fight \ninfections caused by bacteria and viruses or maintain the balance in your immune system (referred to \nas immunomodulation). The medicine works in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins \nnaturally present in your blood.\n\nWhat Hizentra is used for\nReplacement therapy\nHizentra is used to raise abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels\n(replacement therapy). The medicine is used in adults and children (0-18 years) in the following\nsituations:\n\n1. Treatment of patients who are born with a reduced ability or inability to produce immunoglobulins \n(primary immunodeficiencies). This includes conditions such as:\n\uf0b7 low immunoglobulin levels (hypogammaglobulinaemia) or absence of immunoglobulins \n\n(agammaglobulinaemia) in the blood\n\uf0b7 combination of low immunoglobulin levels, frequent infections and inability to produce \n\nadequate amounts of antibodies after vaccination (common variable immunodeficiency)\n\uf0b7 combination of low level or absence of immunoglobulins and absence or non-functional \n\nimmune cells (severe combined immunodeficiency)\n\uf0b7 lack of certain immunoglobulin G subclasses causing recurrent infections.\n\n2. Treatment of low immunoglobulin levels and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with\nchronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), a certain kind of blood cancer, where prophylactic \nantibiotics have failed or are contra-indicated.\n\n\n\n41\n\n3. Treatment of low immunoglobulin levels and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with \nmultiple myeloma (MM), another kind of blood cancer.\n\n4. Treatment of low immunoglobulin levels in patients pre- and post- allogeneic haematopoietic \nstem cell transplantation (HSCT).\n\nImmunomodulatory therapy in CIDP patients\nHizentra is also used in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a \nform of autoimmune disease. CIDP is characterised by chronic inflammation of the peripheral nerves \nthat causes muscle weakness and/or numbness mainly in the legs and arms. It is believed that the \nbody\u2019s defense attack underlines such inflammation, and the immunoglobulins present in Hizentra \nhelp to protect the nerves from being attacked (immunomodulatory therapy).\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Hizentra\n\nDo NOT infuse Hizentra\n\u25ba if you are allergic to human immunoglobulins, polysorbate 80 or L-proline.\n\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have experienced an\nintolerance against one of these components earlier.\n\n\u25ba if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (a genetic disorder causing high levels of the amino acid \nproline in the blood).\n\n\u25ba into a blood vessel.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\uf0e8 Talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using Hizentra.\n\nYou may be allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins without knowing it. However, true allergic \nreactions are rare. They may occur even if you received human immunoglobulins previously and \ntolerated them well. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough of the immunoglobulin type\nA (IgA) in your blood (IgA deficiency).\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have an immunoglobulin \n\ntype A (IgA) deficiency. Hizentra contains residual amounts of IgA which might cause an\nallergic reaction.\n\nIn these rare cases allergic reactions, such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock may occur (see \nalso section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d).\n\uf0e8 If you notice such signs during the infusion of Hizentra, stop the infusion and contact your \n\ndoctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately.\n\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor if you have a history of heart or blood vessel disease or blood clots, have thick \nblood, or have been immobile for some time. These things may increase your risk of having a blood \nclot after using Hizentra. Also tell your doctor what drugs you are using, as some drugs, such as those \nthat contain the hormone estrogen (for example, birth control pills), may increase your risk of \ndeveloping a blood clot. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience signs and symptoms such \nas shortness of breath, chest pain, pain and swelling of a limb, weakness or numbness on one side of \nthe body after receiving Hizentra.\n\n\uf0e8 Contact your doctor if you experience the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, neck \nstiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting after receiving Hizentra. Your doctor \nwill decide if further tests are necessary and whether Hizentra should be continued.\n\nYour healthcare professional will avoid potential complications by ensuring:\n\u25ba that you are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin.\n\nThe medicine must be infused slowly at first. The recommended infusion rate given under \nsection 3 \u201cHow to use Hizentra\u201d must be closely followed.\n\n\n\n42\n\n\u25ba that you are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period, especially if:\n\uf0b7 you receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time\n\uf0b7 you have switched from a different medicine\n\uf0b7 there has been a long interval (more than eight weeks) since the previous infusion.\nIn these cases, it is recommended that you are monitored during the first infusion and for an \nhour afterwards. If the points above do not apply for you it is recommended that you are \nobserved for at least 20 minutes after administration.\n\nOther medicines and Hizentra\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are using, have recently used or might use any \n\nother medicines.\n\uf0e8 You must not mix other medicines with Hizentra.\n\uf0e8 Tell your vaccinating doctor prior to a vaccination about your treatment with Hizentra.\n\nHizentra may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and \nchicken pox. Therefore, after receiving this medicine you may have to wait up to 3 months \nbefore receiving your live-attenuated vaccine. In the case of measles vaccinations the \nimpairment may persist for up to 1 year.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are \n\nbreast-feeding. Your doctor will decide whether you can receive Hizentra during your \npregnancy or while you are breast-feeding.\n\nNo clinical studies have been performed with Hizentra in pregnant women. However, medicines that \ncontain immunoglobulins have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women for years, and no \nharmful effects on the course of pregnancy or on the baby have been observed.\n\nIf you are breast-feeding and receive Hizentra, the immunoglobulins of the medicine can also be found \nin the breast milk. Therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections.\n\nDriving and using machines\nPatients may experience effects, such as dizziness or nausea, during treatment with Hizentra that might \naffect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should not drive or use machines until \nthese effects have disappeared.\n\nHizentra contains proline\nYou must not take it if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (see also section 2 \u201cWhat you need to know \nbefore you use Hizentra\u201d). Please tell your doctor prior to treatment.\n\nOther important information about Hizentra\nBlood tests\nAfter receiving Hizentra, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be impaired for a \ncertain time.\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor about your treatment with Hizentra prior to any blood test.\n\nInformation on what Hizentra is made of\nHizentra is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood). When medicines are \nmade from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being \npassed on to patients. These include:\n\uf0b7 careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \n\nare excluded, and\n\uf0b7 the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections.\nManufacturers of these medicines also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can \ninactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also \napplies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.\n\n\n\n43\n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV, the AIDS virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (liver inflammation), and for the \nnon-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19.\n\n\uf0e8 It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Hizentra the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used (see section \n3 \u201cHow to use Hizentra\u201d).\n\n3. How to use Hizentra\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure.\n\nDosage\nYour doctor will calculate the correct dose for you taking into account your weight and response to \ntreatment.\nThe dose or dosing interval should not be changed without consulting your doctor.\nIf you think you should receive Hizentra more or less frequently, please speak to your doctor.\nIf you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\nReplacement therapy\nYour doctor will determine whether you need a loading dose (for adults and children) of at least 1 to \n2.5 ml/kg of body weight divided over several days. Following this, maintenance doses may be given\nat repeated intervals, from daily to once every two weeks, to reach a cumulative monthly dose of about \n2 to 4 ml/kg of body weight. Your healthcare professional may adjust the dose based on your response \nto the treatment.\n\nImmunomodulatory therapy\nYour doctor will initiate therapy with Hizentra 1 week after your last intravenous immunoglobulin \ninfusion by administrating under the skin (subcutaneously) with a weekly dose of 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg of \nbody weight. Your doctor will determine your weekly Hizentra dose. The weekly maintenance doses \nmay be divided into smaller doses and administered as often as required during the week. For dosing \nevery two weeks, your doctor will double the weekly Hizentra dose. Your healthcare professional may \nadjust the dose based on your response to the treatment.\n\nMethod and route of administration\nIn case of home treatment, this will be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the \ntreatment of immunodeficiency/CIDP with SCIg and in the guidance of patients for home treatment.\n\nYou will be instructed in:\n\uf0b7 aseptic infusion techniques\n\uf0b7 the keeping of a treatment diary, and\n\uf0b7 measures to be taken in case of severe side effects.\n\nInfusion site(s)\n\uf0b7 Administer Hizentra under the skin only.\n\uf0b7 You may infuse Hizentra into sites such as abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and lateral hip. If large \n\ndoses are given (> 50 ml), try to administer them at multiple sites.\n\uf0b7 You may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously. Injection sites should be at least \n\n5 cm apart.\n\uf0b7 In the case, you will use a device-assisted infusion technique (e.g. pump-assisted infusion), \n\nmore than one infusion device can be used simultaneously.\n\n\n\n44\n\n\uf0b7 In the case, you will use the manual push infusion technique with a syringe, you may use only \none infusion site per syringe. If you need to administer an additional Hizentra syringe, you must \nuse a new sterile injection needle and change the infusion site.\n\n\uf0b7 The volume of product infused into a particular site may vary.\n\nInfusion rate(s)\nYour doctor will determine the appropriate infusion technique and the infusion rate for you taking into \naccount your individual dose, dosing frequency and product tolerability.\n\nDevice-assisted infusion:\nThe recommended initial infusion rate is up to 20 ml/hour/site. If well-tolerated, you may gradually \nincrease the infusion rate to 35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. Thereafter, the infusion \nrate can be increased further as per your tolerability.\n\nManual push infusion:\nThe recommended initial infusion rate is up to 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site). If well-tolerated, you \nmay increase the infusion rate up to 2.0 ml/min/site (120 ml/hour/site) for subsequent infusions.\nThereafter, the infusion rate can be increased further as per your tolerability.\n\nInstructions for use\n\nFollow the steps below and use aseptic technique to administer Hizentra.\n1 Clean surface\n\nThoroughly clean a table or other flat surface using an antiseptic wipe.\n2 Assemble supplies\n\nPlace Hizentra and other supplies and equipment needed for the infusion on a clean, flat surface.\n3 Thoroughly wash and dry hands\n4 Check blistered pre-filled syringes\n\nVisually inspect Hizentra for particles in the solution or discoloration as well as expiry date before \nadministering Hizentra. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or contain particles. Do not use \nsolutions that have been frozen. Administer solution which is at room or body temperature.\nOnce a blistered pre-filled syringe has been opened, use the solution immediately.\n\n5 Preparation of Hizentra for infusion\nThe 5 ml and 10 ml pre-filled syringes are \nsupplied fully assembled and ready to use. \n\nAll pre-filled syringes have a standard luer \nlock, which is a screw connection at the \nsyringe tip that creates a leak-free seal.\n\nIf you are using a syringe pump, Hizentra pre-filled syringes can be \nplaced directly in the syringe pump if the syringe size matches the \npump requirements. \n\nIf the pre-filled syringe can be placed directly on the pump, then go \nto Step 6.\n\nIf the Hizentra pre-filled syringe size does not match the pump \nrequirements, then the contents of the pre-filled syringe can be \ntransferred to another syringe of a size specific for the pump.\n\n6 Prepare the tubing\nAttach the administration tubing or needle set to the syringe. Prime the tubing to eliminate all \nremaining air.\n\n\n\n45\n\n7 Prepare infusion site(s)\nSelect the infusion site(s) \u2013 The number and location of infusion\nsites depends on the volume of the total dose. Each infusion site \nshould be at least 5 cm apart.\nYou may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously.\n\nClean the infusion site(s) using an antiseptic skin preparation, \nAllow each site to dry before proceeding.\n\n8 Insert the needle\nGrasp the skin between 2 fingers and insert the needle into the \nsubcutaneous tissue.\n\nSecure the needle to the skin \u2013 If necessary, use gauze and tape or \ntransparent dressing to hold the needle in place.\n\n9 Infuse Hizentra\nStart infusion.\nIf using an infusion pump, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n10 Record the infusion\nRecord the following data in your treatment diary:\n\u2022 the date of administration,\n\u2022 the batch number of the medicine, and\n\u2022 the infused volume, flow rate, the number and location of infusion sites.\n\n11 Clean up\nDiscard any unused product and all used administration supplies after administration in accordance \nwith local requirements.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask your doctor or healthcare \nprofessional.\n\nIf you use more Hizentra than you should\nIf you think you have had too much Hizentra, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to use Hizentra\nIf you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n4.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what hizentra is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what hizentra is hizentra belongs to the class of medicines called human normal immunoglobulins. immunoglobulins are also known as antibodies and are blood proteins that help your body to fight infections. how hizentra works hizentra contains immunoglobulins that have been prepared from the blood of healthy people. immunoglobulins are produced by human body's immune system. they help your body to fight infections caused by bacteria and viruses or maintain the balance in your immune system (referred to as immunomodulation). the medicine works in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins naturally present in your blood. what hizentra is used for replacement therapy hizentra is used to raise abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels (replacement therapy). the medicine is used in adults and children (0-18 years) in the following situations: 1. treatment of patients who are born with a reduced ability or inability to produce immunoglobulins (primary immunodeficiencies). this includes conditions such as: low immunoglobulin levels (hypogammaglobulinaemia) or absence of immunoglobulins (agammaglobulinaemia) in the blood combination of low immunoglobulin levels, frequent infections and inability to produce adequate amounts of antibodies after vaccination (common variable immunodeficiency) combination of low level or absence of immunoglobulins and absence or non-functional immune cells (severe combined immunodeficiency) lack of certain immunoglobulin g subclasses causing recurrent infections. 2. treatment of low immunoglobulin levels and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll), a certain kind of blood cancer, where prophylactic antibiotics have failed or are contra-indicated. 3. treatment of low immunoglobulin levels and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with multiple myeloma (mm), another kind of blood cancer. 4. treatment of low immunoglobulin levels in patients pre- and post- allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct). immunomodulatory therapy in cidp patients hizentra is also used in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (cidp), a form of autoimmune disease. cidp is characterised by chronic inflammation of the peripheral nerves that causes muscle weakness and/or numbness mainly in the legs and arms. it is believed that the body's defense attack underlines such inflammation, and the immunoglobulins present in hizentra help to protect the nerves from being attacked (immunomodulatory therapy).", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "hizentra", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},

immunoglobulins, polysorbate 80 or l-proline. tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have experienced an intolerance against one of these components earlier. if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (a genetic disorder causing high levels of the amino acid proline in the blood). into a blood vessel. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using hizentra. you may be allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins without knowing it. however, true allergic reactions are rare. they may occur even if you received human immunoglobulins previously and tolerated them well. it may happen particularly if you do not have enough of the immunoglobulin type a (iga) in your blood (iga deficiency). tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have an immunoglobulin type a (iga) deficiency. hizentra contains residual amounts of iga which might cause an allergic reaction. in these rare cases allergic reactions, such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock may occur (see also section 4 \"possible side effects\"). if you notice such signs during the infusion of hizentra, stop the infusion and contact your doctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately. tell your doctor if you have a history of heart or blood vessel disease or blood clots, have thick blood, or have been immobile for some time. these things may increase your risk of having a blood clot after using hizentra. also tell your doctor what drugs you are using, as some drugs, such as those that contain the hormone estrogen (for example, birth control pills), may increase your risk of developing a blood clot. contact your doctor immediately if you experience signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, pain and swelling of a limb, weakness or numbness on one side of the body after receiving hizentra. contact your doctor if you experience the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, neck stiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting after receiving hizentra. your doctor will decide if further tests are necessary and whether hizentra should be continued. your healthcare professional will avoid potential complications by ensuring: that you are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin. the medicine must be infused slowly at first. the recommended infusion rate given under section 3 \"how to use hizentra\" must be closely followed. that you are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period, especially if: you receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time you have switched from a different medicine there has been a long interval (more than eight weeks) since the previous infusion. in these cases, it is recommended that you are monitored during the first infusion and for an hour afterwards. if the points above do not apply for you it is recommended that you are observed for at least 20 minutes after administration. other medicines and hizentra tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. you must not mix other medicines with hizentra. tell your vaccinating doctor prior to a vaccination about your treatment with hizentra. hizentra may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and chicken pox. therefore, after receiving this medicine you may have to wait up to 3 months before receiving your live-attenuated vaccine. in the case of measles vaccinations the impairment may persist for up to 1 year. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding. your doctor will decide whether you can receive hizentra during your pregnancy or while you are breast-feeding. no clinical studies have been performed with hizentra in pregnant women. however, medicines that contain immunoglobulins have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women for years, and no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy or on the baby have been observed. if you are breast-feeding and receive hizentra, the immunoglobulins of the medicine can also be found in the breast milk. therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections. driving and using machines patients may experience effects, such as dizziness or nausea, during treatment with hizentra that might affect the ability to drive and use machines. if this happens, you should not drive or use machines until these effects have disappeared. hizentra contains proline you must not take it if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (see also section 2 \"what you need to know before you use hizentra\"). please tell your doctor prior to treatment. other important information about hizentra blood tests after receiving hizentra, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be impaired for a certain time. tell your doctor about your treatment with hizentra prior to any blood test. information on what hizentra is made of hizentra is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood). when medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. these include: careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. manufacturers of these medicines also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. this also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. the measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv, the aids virus), hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus (liver inflammation), and for the non-enveloped hepatitis a virus and parvovirus b19. it is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of hizentra the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used (see section 3 \"how to use hizentra\").",

adjust the dose based on your response to the treatment. immunomodulatory therapy your doctor will initiate therapy with hizentra 1 week after your last intravenous immunoglobulin infusion by administrating under the skin (subcutaneously) with a weekly dose of 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg of body weight. your doctor will determine your weekly hizentra dose. the weekly maintenance doses may be divided into smaller doses and administered as often as required during the week. for dosing every two weeks, your doctor will double the weekly hizentra dose. your healthcare professional may adjust the dose based on your response to the treatment. method and route of administration in case of home treatment, this will be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency/cidp with scig and in the guidance of patients for home treatment. you will be instructed in: aseptic infusion techniques the keeping of a treatment diary, and measures to be taken in case of severe side effects. infusion site(s) administer hizentra under the skin only. you may infuse hizentra into sites such as abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and lateral hip. if large doses are given (> 50 ml), try to administer them at multiple sites. you may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously. injection sites should be at least 5 cm apart. in the case, you will use a device-assisted infusion technique (e.g. pump-assisted infusion), more than one infusion device can be used simultaneously. in the case, you will use the manual push infusion technique with a syringe, you may use only one infusion site per syringe. if you need to administer an additional hizentra syringe, you must use a new sterile injection needle and change the infusion site. the volume of product infused into a particular site may vary. infusion rate(s) your doctor will determine the appropriate infusion technique and the infusion rate for you taking into account your individual dose, dosing frequency and product tolerability. device-assisted infusion: the recommended initial infusion rate is up to 20 ml/hour/site. if well-tolerated, you may gradually increase the infusion rate to 35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. thereafter, the infusion rate can be increased further as per your tolerability. manual push infusion: the recommended initial infusion rate is up to 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site). if well-tolerated, you may increase the infusion rate up to 2.0 ml/min/site (120 ml/hour/site) for subsequent infusions. thereafter, the infusion rate can be increased further as per your tolerability. instructions for use follow the steps below and use aseptic technique to administer hizentra. 1 clean surface thoroughly clean a table or other flat surface using an antiseptic wipe. 2 assemble supplies place hizentra and other supplies and equipment needed for the infusion on a clean, flat surface. 3 thoroughly wash and dry hands 4 check vials visually inspect hizentra for particles in the solution or discoloration as well as expiry date before administering hizentra. do not use solutions that are cloudy or contain particles. do not use solutions that have been frozen. administer solution which is at room or body temperature. once a vial has been opened, use the solution immediately. 5 preparation of hizentra for infusion clean the vial stopper remove the protective cap from the vial to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper. clean the stopper with an alcohol wipe or antiseptic preparation and allow it to dry. transfer hizentra to syringe for infusion attach a transfer device or needle to a sterile syringe, using aseptic technique. if using a transfer device (vented spike), follow the instructions provided by the device manufacturer. if using a needle, pull back on the plunger to draw air into the syringe that is comparable to the amount of hizentra to be withdrawn. then, insert the needle into the center of the vial stopper and, to avoid foaming, inject air into headspace of the vial (not into the liquid). finally, withdraw the desired volume of hizentra. when using multiple vials to achieve the desired dose, repeat this step. 6 prepare the tubing attach the administration tubing or needle set to the syringe. prime the tubing to eliminate all remaining air. 7 prepare infusion site(s) select the infusion site(s) the number and location of infusion sites depends on the volume of the total dose. each infusion site should be at least 5 cm apart. you may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously. clean the infusion site(s) using an antiseptic skin preparation, allow each site to dry before proceeding. 8 insert the needle grasp the skin between 2 fingers and insert the needle into the subcutaneous tissue. secure the needle to the skin if necessary, use gauze and tape or transparent dressing to hold the needle in place. 9 infuse hizentra start infusion. if using an infusion pump, follow the manufacturer's instructions. record the infusion record the following data in your treatment diary: the date of administration, the batch number of the medicine, and the infused volume, flow rate, the number and location of infusion sites. clean up discard any unused product and all used administration supplies after administration in accordance with local requirements. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask your doctor or healthcare professional. if you use more hizentra than you should if you think you have had too much hizentra, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. if you forget to use hizentra if you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "hizentra", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
