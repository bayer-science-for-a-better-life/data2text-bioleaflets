This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nFasenra 30 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe\nFasenra 30 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nPre-filled syringe\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 mg benralizumab* in 1 mL.\n\nPre-filled pen\nEach pre-filled pen contains 30 mg benralizumab* in 1 mL.\n\n*Benralizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells\nby recombinant DNA technology.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection)\nSolution for injection in pre-filled pen (injection) (Fasenra Pen)\n\nClear to opalescent, colourless to yellow solution and may contain translucent or white to off-white \nparticles.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFasenra is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with severe eosinophilic \nasthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting \u03b2-agonists \n(see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nFasenra treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of \nsevere asthma.\n\nAfter proper training in the subcutaneous injection technique and education about signs and symptoms \nof hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.4), patients with no known history of anaphylaxis or their\ncaregivers may administer Fasenra if their physician determines that it is appropriate, with medical \nfollow-up as necessary. Self-administration should only be considered in patients already experienced \nwith Fasenra treatment.\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of benralizumab is 30 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for the \nfirst 3 doses, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. If an injection is missed on the planned date, dosing \nshould resume as soon as possible on the indicated regimen; a double dose must not be administered.\n\nFasenra is intended for long-term treatment. A decision to continue the therapy should be made at least \nannually based on disease severity, level of exacerbation control and blood eosinophil counts.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Fasenra in children aged 6 to 18 years have not been established.\n\nNo data are available for children aged 6 to 11 years old. Currently available data in children 12 to less \nthan 18 years old are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nFasenra is administered as a subcutaneous injection.\n\nIt should be injected into the thigh or abdomen. If the healthcare professional or caregiver administers \nthe injection, the upper arm can also be used. It should not be injected into areas where the skin is \ntender, bruised, erythematous, or hardened.\n\nComprehensive instructions for administration using the pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen (Fasenra Pen) \nare provided in the \u2018Instructions for Use\u2019.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nFasenra should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations.\n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens\nafter initiation of treatment.\n\nAbrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids after initiation of Fasenra therapy is not recommended. \nReduction in corticosteroid doses, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the \nsupervision of a physician.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nAcute systemic reactions including anaphylactic reactions and hypersensitivity reactions \n(e.g. urticaria, papular urticaria, rash) have occurred following administration of benralizumab (see \nsection 4.8). These reactions may occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a \ndelayed onset (i.e. days).\n\n\n\n4\n\nA history of anaphylaxis unrelated to benralizumab may be a risk factor for anaphylaxis following \nFasenra administration (see section 4.3). In line with clinical practice, patients should be monitored for \nan appropriate time after administration of Fasenra.\n\nIn the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, Fasenra should be discontinued permanently and \nappropriate therapy initiated. \n\nParasitic (Helminth) Infection\n\nEosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients \nwith known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical trials. It is unknown if \nFasenra may influence a patient\u2019s response against helminth infections.\n\nPatients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating therapy with Fasenra. \nIf patients become infected, while receiving treatment with Fasenra and do not respond to \nanti-helminth treatment, treatment with Fasenra should be discontinued until infection resolves.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn a randomized, double-blind parallel-group study of 103 patients aged between 12 and 21 years with \nsevere asthma, the humoral antibody responses induced by seasonal influenza virus vaccination do not \nappear to be affected by benralizumab treatment. An effect of benralizumab on the pharmacokinetics \nof co-administered medicinal products is not expected (see section 5.2).\n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the \nclearance of benralizumab. There is no evidence of IL-5R\u03b1 expression on hepatocytes. Eosinophil \ndepletion does not produce chronic systemic alterations of proinflammatory cytokines. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is a limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of benralizumab in \npregnant women.\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\nMonoclonal antibodies, such as benralizumab, are transported across the placenta linearly as \npregnancy progresses; therefore, potential exposure to a fetus is likely to be greater during the second \nand third trimester of pregnancy. \n\nIt is preferable to avoid the use of Fasenra during pregnancy. Its administration to pregnant women \nshould only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the \nfetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether benralizumab or its metabolites are excreted in human or animal milk. Risk to \nthe breast-fed child cannot be excluded.\n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from using \nFasenra taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman.\n\nFertility\n\n\n\n5\n\nThere are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects of benralizumab \ntreatment on fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nFasenra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment are headache (8%) and pharyngitis\n(3%). Anaphylactic reactions have been reported.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nA total of 2,514 patients, out of whom 1,663 patients had severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma, \nreceived benralizumab during clinical studies of 48 to 56 weeks duration. \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1. Tabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\n\nInfections & infestations Pharyngitis* Common\n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions**\n\nAnaphylactic reaction\n\nCommon\n\nNot known\n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nPyrexia\n\nInjection site reaction \n\nCommon\n\n* Pharyngitis was defined by the following grouped preferred terms: \u2018Pharyngitis\u2019, \u2018Pharyngitis bacterial\u2019, \u2018Viral \npharyngitis\u2019, \u2018Pharyngitis streptococcal\u2019. \n** Hypersensitivity reactions were defined by the following grouped preferred terms: \u2018Urticaria\u2019, \u2018Papular \nurticaria\u2019, and \u2018Rash\u2019. For examples of the associated manifestations reported and a description of the time to \nonset, see section 4.4.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reaction\n\nInjection site reactions \nIn placebo-controlled studies, injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, pruritus, papule) occurred at \na rate of 2.2% in patients treated with the recommended benralizumab dose compared with 1.9% in \npatients treated with placebo.\n\nLong-term safety \n\nIn a 56-week extension trial in patients with asthma from Trials 1, 2 and 3, 842 patients were treated \nwith Fasenra at the recommended dose and remained in the trial. The overall adverse event profile was \nsimilar to the asthma trials described above.\n\nPaediatric population\n\n\n\n6\n\nThere are limited data in paediatric patients (see section 5.1). The frequency, type and severity of \nadverse reactions in the adolescent population were observed to be similar to those seen in adults.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses of up to 200 mg were administered subcutaneously in clinical trials to patients with eosinophilic \nasthma without evidence of dose-related toxicities.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for an overdose with benralizumab. If overdose occurs, the patient \nshould be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for \nobstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX10\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBenralizumab is an anti-eosinophil, humanised afucosylated, monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa). It\nbinds to the alpha subunit of the human interleukin-5 receptor (IL-5R\u03b1) with high affinity and \nspecificity. The IL-5 receptor is specifically expressed on the surface of eosinophils and basophils. \nThe absence of fucose in the Fc domain of benralizumab results in high affinity for Fc\u0263RIII receptors \non immune effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells. This leads to apoptosis of eosinophils and \nbasophils through enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which reduces \neosinophilic inflammation. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nEffect on blood eosinophils\nTreatment with benralizumab results in near complete depletion of blood eosinophils within 24 hours \nfollowing the first dose which is maintained throughout treatment. The depletion of blood eosinophils \nis accompanied by a reduction in serum eosinophil granule proteins eosinophil derived neurotoxin \n(EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and a reduction in blood basophils.\n\nEffect on eosinophils in the airway mucosa\nThe effect of benralizumab on eosinophils in the airway mucosa in asthmatic patients with elevated \nsputum eosinophil counts (at least 2.5%) was evaluated in a 12-week, phase 1, randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled clinical study with benralizumab 100 or 200 mg SC. In this study there was a \nmedian reduction from baseline in airway mucosa eosinophils of 96% in the benralizumab treated \ngroup compared to a 47% reduction in the placebo group (p=0.039).\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nThe efficacy of Fasenra was evaluated in 3 randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials between 28 to 56 weeks duration, in patients aged 12 to 75 years. \n\n\n\n7\n\nIn these studies, Fasenra was administered at a dose of 30 mg once every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, \nand then every 4 or 8 weeks thereafter as add-on to background treatment and was evaluated in \ncomparison with placebo.\n\nThe two exacerbation trials, SIROCCO (Trial 1) and CALIMA (Trial 2), enrolled a total of 2,510 \npatients with severe uncontrolled asthma, 64% females, with a mean age of 49 years. Patients had a \nhistory of 2 or more asthma exacerbations requiring oral or systemic corticosteroid treatment (mean of \n3) in the past 12 months, ACQ-6 score of 1.5 or more at screening, and reduced lung function at \nbaseline (mean predicted pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] of 57.5%), \ndespite regular treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (Trial 1) or with medium or \nhigh-dose ICS (Trial 2) and a long-acting \u03b2-agonist (LABA); at least one additional controller was \nadministered to 51% and 41% of these patients, respectively.\n\nFor the oral corticosteroid (OCS) reduction trial ZONDA (Trial 3), a total of 220 asthma patients (61% \nfemale; mean age of 51 years) were enrolled; they were treated with daily OCS (8 to 40 mg per day; \nmedian of 10 mg) in addition to regular use of high-dose ICS and LABA with at least one additional \ncontroller to maintain asthma control in 53% of the cases. The trial included an 8-week run-in period \nduring which the OCS was titrated to the minimum effective dose without losing asthma control.\nPatients had blood eosinophil counts \u2265150 cells/\u03bcL and a history of at least one exacerbation in the \npast 12 months. \n\nWhile 2 dosing regimens were studied in Trials 1, 2, and 3, the recommended dosing regimen is \nFasenra administered every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then every 8 weeks thereafter (see section \n4.2) as no additional benefit was observed by more frequent dosing. The results summarised below are \nthose for the recommended dosing regimen.\n\nExacerbation trials\n\nThe primary endpoint was the annual rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations in patients \nwith baseline blood eosinophil counts \u2265300 cells/\u03bcL who were taking high-dose ICS and LABA. \nClinically significant asthma exacerbation was defined as worsening of asthma requiring use of \noral/systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days, and/or emergency department visits requiring use of \noral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalisation. For patients on maintenance oral corticosteroids, \nthis was defined as a temporary increase in stable oral/systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days or a \nsingle depo-injectable dose of corticosteroids.\n\nIn both trials, patients receiving Fasenra experienced significant reductions in annual exacerbation \nrates compared to placebo in patients with blood eosinophils \u2265300 cells/\u03bcL. In addition, change from \nbaseline in mean FEV1 showed benefit as early as 4 weeks, which was maintained through to end of \ntreatment (Table 2).  \n\nReductions in exacerbation rates were observed irrespective of baseline eosinophil count; however, \nincreasing baseline eosinophil counts was identified as a potential predictor of improved treatment \nresponse particularly for FEV1.\n\nTable 2.

Not powered to detect a treatment difference in patients with blood eosinophils <300 cells/\u03bcl. \n\nAcross Trials 1 and 2 combined, there was a numerically greater exacerbation rate reduction and \ngreater improvements in FEV1 with increasing baseline blood eosinophils. \n\nThe rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation and/or emergency room visits for patients receiving \nFasenra compared to placebo for Trial 1 were 0.09 versus 0.25 (rate ratio 0.37, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.67, \np=<0.001) and for Trial 2 were 0.12 versus 0.10 (rate ratio 1.23, 95% CI: 0.64, 2.35, p=0.538). In Trial \n2, there were too few events in the placebo treatment arm to draw conclusions for exacerbations \nrequiring hospitalisation or emergency room visits.\n\nIn both Trials 1 and 2, patients receiving Fasenra experienced statistically significant reductions in \nasthma symptoms (Total Asthma Score) compared to patients receiving placebo. Similar improvement \nin favour of Fasenra was observed for the Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) and Standardised \nAsthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 Years and Older (AQLQ(S)+12) (Table 3).\n\nTable 3.

Patients were permitted to enter a second \nextension trial after a minimum of 8 weeks in Trial 4 without completing the 56-week extension period.\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nOverall, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody response developed in 107 out of 809 (13%) patients \ntreated with Fasenra at the recommended dosing regimen during the 48 to 56 week treatment period of \nthe phase 3 placebo controlled exacerbation trials. Most antibodies were neutralising and persistent. \nAnti-benralizumab antibodies were associated with increased clearance of benralizumab and increased \nblood eosinophil levels in patients with high anti-drug antibody titres compared to antibody negative \npatients; in rare cases, blood eosinophil levels returned to pre-treatment levels. Based on current \npatient follow-up, no evidence of an association of anti-drug antibodies with efficacy or safety was \nobserved.\n\nFollowing a second year of treatment of these patients from the phase 3 placebo-controlled trials, an \nadditional 18 out of 510 (4%) had newly developed treatment-emergent antibodies. Overall, in patients \nwho were anti-drug antibody positive in the predecessor trials, titres remained stable or declined in the \nsecond year of treatment. No evidence of an association of anti-drug antibodies with efficacy or safety \nwas observed.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere were 108 adolescents aged 12 to 17 with asthma enrolled in the phase 3 trials (Trial 1: n=53, \nTrial 2: n=55). Of these, 46 received placebo, 40 received Fasenra every 4 weeks for 3 doses, followed \nby every 8 weeks thereafter, and 22 received Fasenra every 4 weeks. In these trials, the asthma \nexacerbation rate in adolescent patients treated with Fasenra administered at the recommended dosing \nregimen was 0.70 (n=40, 95% CI: 0.42, 1.18) compared to 0.41 for placebo (n=46, 95% CI: 0.23, \n0.73) [rate ratio 1.70, 95% CI: 0.78, 3.69]. \n\nAdolescent patients aged 12 to 17 (n=86) from Trials 1 and 2 continued treatment with Fasenra in \nTrial 4 for up to 108 weeks. Efficacy and safety were consistent with the predecessor trials.\n\nNo conclusion can be drawn regarding asthma efficacy in the paediatric population.\n\nTrial 4Trial 3\n\nM\ned\n\nia\nn\n\n p\ner\n\nce\nn\n\nt \nre\n\nd\nu\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n\nWeek(s)\n\nBenra 30 mg q. 8 weeks\n\nn =\n\n\n\n13\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFasenra in paediatric population aged from birth to less than 6 years in asthma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with\nFasenra in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in asthma (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of benralizumab were dose-proportional in patients with asthma following \nsubcutaneous administration over a dose range of 2 to 200 mg.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration to patients with asthma, the absorption half-life was 3.5 days. \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated absolute bioavailability was \napproximately 59% and there was no clinically relevant difference in relative bioavailability in the \nadministration to the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. \n\nDistribution\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, central and peripheral volume of distribution of \nbenralizumab was 3.1 L and 2.5 L, respectively, for a 70 kg individual.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nBenralizumab is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is degraded by proteolytic enzymes \nwidely distributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue.\n\nElimination\n\nFrom population pharmacokinetic analysis, benralizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics and no \nevidence of target receptor-mediated clearance pathway. The estimated systemic clearance (CL) for \nbenralizumab was at 0.29 L/d. Following subcutaneous administration, the elimination half-life was \napproximately 15.5 days.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly patients (\u226565 years old)\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age did not affect benralizumab clearance. However, \nno data are available in patients over 75 years of age.\n\nPaediatric\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of benralizumab in \nadolescents aged 12 to 17 years were consistent with adults. Benralizumab has not been studied in \nchildren (5 to 11 years old) (see section 4.2).\n\nGender, Race\nA population pharmacokinetics analysis, indicated that there was no significant effect of gender and \nrace on benralizumab clearance.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on \nbenralizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, benralizumab clearance was comparable \nin subjects with creatinine clearance values between 30 and 80 mL/min and patients with normal renal \nfunction. There are limited data available in subjects with creatinine clearance values less than \n30 mL/min; however, benralizumab is not cleared renally.\n\n\n\n14\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on \nbenralizumab. IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathway; change in \nhepatic function is not expected to influence benralizumab clearance. Based on population \npharmacokinetic analysis, baseline hepatic function biomarkers (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) had no \nclinically relevant effect on benralizumab clearance. \n\nDrug-Drug interaction\nAn effect of benralizumab on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicinal products is not \nexpected. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, commonly co-administered medicinal \nproducts (montelukast, paracetamol, proton pump inhibitors, macrolides and \ntheophylline/aminophylline) had no effect on benralizumab clearance in patients with asthma. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAs benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been \nconducted.\n\nAnimal toxicology and/or pharmacology\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology or repeated dose toxicity studies in monkeys. Intravenous and subcutaneous \nadministration to cynomolgus monkeys was associated with reductions in peripheral blood and bone \nmarrow eosinophil counts, with no toxicological findings.\n\nPregnancy\n\nIn a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, there were no \nbenralizumab-related maternal, embryo-foetal, or postnatal effects observed.\n\nFertility\n\nNo dedicated animal studies have been conducted. No benralizumab-related impairment was observed \nin reproductive parameters of male and female cynomolgus monkeys. Examination of surrogate \nfertility parameters (including organ weights and histopathology of reproductive tissues) in animals \ntreated with benralizumab suggested no impairment of fertility. However, in the offspring of monkeys \ndosed while pregnant, there was a reduction in eosinophils.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n30\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nFasenra 30 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe\nbenralizumab\n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Fasenra is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Fasenra\n3. How to use Fasenra\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fasenra\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n1. What Fasenra is and what it is used for   \n\nWhat Fasenra is\nFasenra is a medicine containing the active substance benralizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, \na type of protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target substance in the body. The target of \nbenralizumab is a protein called interleukin-5 receptor, which is found particularly on a type of white \nblood cell called an eosinophil.\n\nWhat Fasenra is used for\nFasenra is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adults. Eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma \nwhere patients have too many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. \n\nFasenra is used together with other medicines to treat asthma (high doses of \u2018corticosteroid inhalers\u2019\nplus other asthma medicines) when the disease is not well controlled by those other medicines alone. \n\nHow Fasenra works\nEosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. By attaching to the eosinophils, \nFasenra helps to reduce their numbers. \n\nWhat are the benefits of using Fasenra\nFasenra may reduce the number of asthma attacks you are experiencing, help you breathe better and \ndecrease your asthma symptoms. If you are taking medicines called \u2018oral corticosteroids\u2019, using\nFasenra may also allow you to reduce the daily dose or stop the oral corticosteroids you need to \ncontrol your asthma.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Fasenra\n\nDo not use Fasenra:\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to benralizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you think this applies to you.\n\n\n\n31\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Fasenra:\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a parasitic infection or if you live in an area where parasitic infections are common \nor you are travelling to such a region. This medicine may weaken your ability to fight certain \ntypes of parasitic infections,\n\n\uf0b7 if you have had an allergic reaction to an injection or medicine in the past (see section 4 for \nsymptoms of an allergic reaction).\n\nAlso, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist when you are given Fasenra:\n\uf0b7 if your asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine.\n\uf0b7 if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction (see section 4). Allergic reactions have \n\noccurred in patients receiving this medicine. \n\nLook out for signs of serious allergic reactions \nFasenra can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. You must look out for signs of these reactions \n(such as hives, rash, breathing problems, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded and/or swelling of \nyour face, tongue or mouth) while you are taking Fasenra.\n\nIt is important that you talk to your doctor about how to recognise early symptoms of serious allergic \nreactions and how to manage these reactions if they occur.\n\nOther medicines for asthma\nDo not suddenly stop taking your preventer medicines for your asthma once you have started \nFasenra. \n\nIf your response to the treatment allows it, your doctor may try to reduce the dose of some of these \nmedicines, especially ones called \u2018corticosteroids\u2019. This should be done gradually, under the direct \nsupervision of your doctor.\n\nOther medicines and Fasenra\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines before using \nFasenra.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe safety and benefits of this medicine are not known in children below the age of 18. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before using this medicine. \n\nDo not use Fasenra if you are pregnant unless your doctor tells you otherwise. It is not known whether \nFasenra could harm your unborn baby. \n\nIt is not known whether the ingredients of Fasenra can pass into breast milk. If you are \nbreast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, talk to your doctor. \n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is unlikely that Fasenra will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\n3. How to use Fasenra\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or \npharmacist if you are not sure.\n\n\n\n32\n\nFasenra is given as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). You and your doctor or nurse \nshould decide if you should inject Fasenra yourself. You should not inject Fasenra yourself if you have \nnot received Fasenra previously and if you had previous allergic reaction with Fasenra.\n\nYou or your caregiver should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Fasenra. Read the \n\u2018Instructions for Use\u2019 for the pre-filled syringe carefully before using Fasenra.\n\nThe recommended dose is an injection of 30 mg. The first 3 injections are every 4 weeks. After this, \ninjections are 30 mg every 8 weeks. \n\nIf a dose of Fasenra is missed\nIf you have forgotten to inject a dose of Fasenra, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as \npossible.\n\nStopping treatment with Fasenra\nDo not stop treatment with Fasenra unless your doctor advises you to. Interrupting or stopping the \ntreatment with Fasenra may cause your asthma symptoms and attacks to come back.\n\nIf your asthma symptoms get worse while receiving injections of Fasenra, call your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSerious allergic reactions\nSeek medical attention immediately if you think you may be having an allergic reaction. Such \nreactions may happen within hours or days after the injection.   \n\nNot known (the frequency cannot be determined from the available data):\n\uf0b7 anaphylaxis\n\nsymptoms usually include: \no swelling of your face, tongue, or mouth \no breathing problems\no fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded (due to a drop in blood pressure)\n\nCommon (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 hives\n\uf0b7 rash\n\nOther side effects\nCommon (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\uf0b7 headache\n\uf0b7 pharyngitis (sore throat)\n\uf0b7 fever (high temperature)\n\uf0b7 injection site reaction (for example pain, redness, itching, swelling near where the injection  was \n\ngiven) \n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.

What you need to know before you use Fasenra\n3. How to use Fasenra Pen\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fasenra Pen\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n1. What Fasenra is and what it is used for   \n\nWhat Fasenra is\nFasenra is a medicine containing the active substance benralizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, \na type of protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target substance in the body. The target of \nbenralizumab is a protein called interleukin-5 receptor, which is found particularly on a type of white \nblood cell called an eosinophil.\n\nWhat Fasenra is used for\nFasenra is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adults. Eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma \nwhere patients have too many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. \n\nFasenra is used together with other medicines to treat asthma (high doses of \u2018corticosteroid inhalers\u2019\nplus other asthma medicines) when the disease is not well controlled by those other medicines alone. \n\nHow Fasenra works\nEosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. By attaching to the eosinophils, \nFasenra helps to reduce their numbers. \n\nWhat are the benefits of using Fasenra\nFasenra may reduce the number of asthma attacks you are experiencing, help you breathe better and \ndecrease your asthma symptoms. If you are taking medicines called \u2018oral corticosteroids\u2019, using\nFasenra may also allow you to reduce the daily dose or stop the oral corticosteroids you need to \ncontrol your asthma.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Fasenra\n\nDo not use Fasenra:\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to benralizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you think this applies to you.\n\n\n\n42\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Fasenra:\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a parasitic infection or if you live in an area where parasitic infections are common \nor you are travelling to such a region. This medicine may weaken your ability to fight certain \ntypes of parasitic infections,\n\n\uf0b7 if you have had an allergic reaction to an injection or medicine in the past (see section 4 for \nsymptoms of an allergic reaction).\n\nAlso, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist when you are given Fasenra:\n\uf0b7 if your asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine.\n\uf0b7 if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction (see section 4). Allergic reactions have \n\noccurred in patients receiving this medicine. \n\nLook out for signs of serious allergic reactions \nFasenra can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. You must look out for signs of these reactions \n(such as hives, rash, breathing problems, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded and/or swelling of \nyour face, tongue or mouth) while you are taking Fasenra.\n\nIt is important that you talk to your doctor about how to recognise early symptoms of serious allergic \nreactions and how to manage these reactions if they occur.\n\nOther medicines for asthma\nDo not suddenly stop taking your preventer medicines for your asthma once you have started \nFasenra. \n\nIf your response to the treatment allows it, your doctor may try to reduce the dose of some of these \nmedicines, especially ones called \u2018corticosteroids\u2019. This should be done gradually, under the direct \nsupervision of your doctor.\n\nOther medicines and Fasenra\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines before using \nFasenra.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe safety and benefits of this medicine are not known in children below the age of 18. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before using this medicine. \n\nDo not use Fasenra if you are pregnant unless your doctor tells you otherwise. It is not known whether \nFasenra could harm your unborn baby. \n\nIt is not known whether the ingredients of Fasenra can pass into breast milk. If you are \nbreast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, talk to your doctor. \n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is unlikely that Fasenra will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\n3. How to use Fasenra Pen\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or \npharmacist if you are not sure.\n\n\n\n43\n\nFasenra is given as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). You and your doctor or nurse \nshould decide if you should inject Fasenra yourself. You should not inject Fasenra yourself if you have \nnot received Fasenra previously and if you had previous allergic reaction with Fasenra.\n\nYou or your caregiver should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Fasenra. Read the \n\u2018Instructions for Use\u2019 for the Fasenra Pen carefully before using Fasenra.\n\nThe recommended dose is an injection of 30 mg. The first 3 injections are every 4 weeks. After this, \ninjections are 30 mg every 8 weeks. \n\nIf a dose of Fasenra is missed\nIf you have forgotten to inject a dose of Fasenra, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as \npossible.\n\nStopping treatment with Fasenra\nDo not stop treatment with Fasenra unless your doctor advises you to. Interrupting or stopping the \ntreatment with Fasenra may cause your asthma symptoms and attacks to come back.\n\nIf your asthma symptoms get worse while receiving injections of Fasenra, call your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSerious allergic reactions\nSeek medical attention immediately if you think you may be having an allergic reaction. Such \nreactions may happen within hours or days after the injection.   \n\nNot known (the frequency cannot be determined from the available data):\n\uf0b7 anaphylaxis\n\nsymptoms usually include: \no swelling of your face, tongue, or mouth \no breathing problems\no fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded (due to a drop in blood pressure)\n\nCommon (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 hives\n\uf0b7 rash\n\nOther side effects\nCommon (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\uf0b7 headache\n\uf0b7 pharyngitis (sore throat)\n\uf0b7 fever (high temperature)\n\uf0b7 injection site reaction (for example pain, redness, itching, swelling near where the injection was \n\ngiven) \n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n\n\n44\n\n5.

a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target substance in the body. the target of benralizumab is a protein called interleukin-5 receptor, which is found particularly on a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil. what fasenra is used for fasenra is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adults. eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma where patients have too many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. fasenra is used together with other medicines to treat asthma (high doses of 'corticosteroid inhalers' plus other asthma medicines) when the disease is not well controlled by those other medicines alone. how fasenra works eosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. by attaching to the eosinophils, fasenra helps to reduce their numbers. what are the benefits of using fasenra fasenra may reduce the number of asthma attacks you are experiencing, help you breathe better and decrease your asthma symptoms. if you are taking medicines called 'oral corticosteroids', using fasenra may also allow you to reduce the daily dose or stop the oral corticosteroids you need to control your asthma.", "Entity_Recognition":
