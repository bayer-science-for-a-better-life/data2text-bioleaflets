This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTaltz 80 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe.  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 80 mg ixekizumab in 1 ml. \n \nIxekizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody produced in CHO cells. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection). \n \nThe solution is clear and colourless to slightly yellow. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nTaltz is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates \nfor systemic therapy. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nTaltz is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children from the age \nof 6 years and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and adolescents who are candidates for \nsystemic therapy. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nTaltz, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic \narthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapies (see section 5.1). \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nAnkylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nTaltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis who have \nresponded inadequately to conventional therapy. \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nTaltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein \n(CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTaltz is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Taltz is indicated. \n \nPosology \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults \nThe recommended dose is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, \nfollowed by 80 mg (one injection) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then maintenance dosing of 80 mg \n(one injection) every 4 weeks (Q4W).  \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) \nEfficacy and safety data is not available in children below the age of 6 years (see section 5.1). \nAvailable data do not support a posology below a body weight of 25 kg. \nThe recommended dose given by subcutaneous injection in children is based on the following weight \ncategories: \n \n\nChildren’s Body \nWeight \n\nRecommended Starting \nDose (Week 0) \n\nRecommended Dose every \n4 weeks (Q4W) thereafter \n\nGreater than 50 kg  160 mg (two 80 mg injections) 80 mg \n25 to 50 kg 80 mg 40 mg \n\n \nFor children prescribed 80 mg, Taltz can be used directly from the prefilled syringe. \nFor instructions on preparation of Taltz 40 mg, see section 6.6. Doses less than 80 mg must be \nprepared by a healthcare professional. \nTaltz is not recommended for use in children with a body weight below 25 kg. Paediatric body weights \nmust be recorded and regularly re-checked prior to dosing. \n  \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe recommended dose is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, \nfollowed by 80 mg (one injection) every 4 weeks thereafter. For psoriatic arthritis patients with \nconcomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended dosing regimen is the same as for \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis (radiographic and non-radiographic) \nThe recommended dose is 160 mg (two 80 mg injections) by subcutaneous injection at Week 0, \nfollowed by 80 mg every 4 weeks (see section 5.1 for further information). \n \nFor all indications (plaque psoriasis in adults and children, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis) \nconsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after \n16 to 20 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initially partial response may subsequently improve \nwith continued treatment beyond 20 weeks. \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 75 years. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nTaltz has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (below a body weight of 25 kg and below the age of 6 years) \nThere is no relevant use of Taltz in children below a body weight of 25 kg and below the age of \n6 years in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nPaediatric psoriatic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of Taltz in children and adolescents aged 2 to less than 18 years in the \ntreatment of psoriatic arthritis (a category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis) have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. There is no relevant use of Taltz in children below 2 years for the \nindication of psoriatic arthritis. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSubcutaneous use. \n \nTaltz is for subcutaneous injection. Injection sites may be alternated. If possible, areas of the skin that \nshow psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The solution/the syringe must not be shaken. \n \nAfter proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Taltz if a healthcare \nprofessional determines that it is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate \nfollow-up of patients. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet \nand the user manual.  \n \nDoses less than 80 mg which require dose preparation should only be administered by a healthcare \nprofessional. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSerious hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nClinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nTreatment with Taltz is associated with an increased rate of infections such as upper respiratory tract \ninfection, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis, and tinea infections (see section 4.8). \n \nTaltz should be used with caution in patients with clinically important chronic infection or a history of \nrecurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms \nsuggestive of an infection occur. If an infection develops, monitor carefully and discontinue Taltz if \nthe patient is not responding to standard therapy or if the infection becomes serious. Taltz should not \nbe resumed until the infection resolves. \n \nTaltz must not be given to patients with active tuberculosis (TB). Consider anti-TB therapy prior to \ninitiation of Taltz in patients with latent TB. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including some cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria and, \nrarely, late (10-14 days following injection) serious hypersensitivity reactions including widespread \nurticaria, dyspnea and high antibody titres have been reported.  If a serious hypersensitivity reaction \noccurs, administration of Taltz should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) \n \nCases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with ixekizumab \n(see section 4.8). Ixekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a \npatient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of \npre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, ixekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical \nmanagement should be initiated. \n \nImmunisations \n \nTaltz should not be used with live vaccines. No data are available on the response to live vaccines; \nthere are insufficient data on response to inactive vaccines (see section 5.1). \n \nExcipients  \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 80 mg dose, i.e., essentially \n“sodium-free”.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn plaque psoriasis studies, the safety of Taltz in combination with other immunomodulatory agents or \nphototherapy has not been evaluated. \nIn population pharmacokinetic analyses, drug clearance of ixekizumab was not affected by \nconcomitant administration of oral corticosteroids, NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, or methotrexate. \n \nCytochrome P450 Substrates \n \nResults from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis determined \nthat 12 weeks of administration of ixekizumab with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., midazolam), \nCYP2C9 (i.e., warfarin), CYP2C19 (i.e., omeprazole), CYP1A2 (i.e., caffeine) or CYP2D6 (i.e., \ndextromethorphan) does not have a clinically significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of these \ndrugs. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment \nand for at least 10 weeks after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of ixekizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do \nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is \npreferable to avoid the use of Taltz during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether ixekizumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after \ningestion. However, ixekizumab is excreted at low levels in the milk of cynomolgus monkeys. A \ndecision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Taltz taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nFertility \n \nThe effect of ixekizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTaltz has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were injection site reactions (15.5 %) \nand upper respiratory tract infections (16.4 %) (most frequently nasopharyngitis). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nADRs from clinical studies and postmarketing reports (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ \nclass. Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent \nreactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each ADR is based on \nthe following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nA total of 8,956 patients have been treated with Taltz in blinded and open-label clinical studies in \nplaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and other autoimmune conditions. Of these, \n6,385 patients were exposed to Taltz for at least one year, cumulatively representing 19,833 \nadult  patient years of exposure and 196 children cumulatively representing 207 patient years of \nexposure.  \nIn plaque psoriasis in adults a total of 3,119 patients were evaluated in clinical trials (2,328 patients on \nixekizumab).  \nIn psoriatic arthritis in adults a total of 678 patients were evaluated in clinical trials (454 patients on \nixekizumab). \nIn axial spondyloarthritis (radiographic and non-radiographic axSpA) a total of 868 patients were \nevaluated in clinical trials (574 patients on ixekizumab). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 1.  List of adverse reactions in clinical studies and postmarketing reports \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations  \n \n\nVery Common Upper respiratory tract \ninfection \n\nCommon Tinea infection, Herpes \nsimplex (mucocutaneous) \n\nUncommon Influenza, Rhinitis, Oral \ncandidiasis, Conjunctivitis, \nCellulitis \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders  \n\nUncommon Neutropenia, \nThrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders  Uncommon  Angioedema \nRare Anaphylaxis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders  \n\nCommon Oropharyngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Common Nausea \nUncommon  Inflammatory bowel disease \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ndisorders  \n\nUncommon Urticaria, Rash, Eczema \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common Injection site reactionsa \n\na See section description of selected adverse reactions \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n(Based on adverse reactions data from 4,204 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis \n[4,729.7 patient years] and 1,117 patients with active psoriatic arthritis [1,050.6 patient years] and \n196 patients with paediatric psoriasis [207 patient years] who have received at least 1 dose of \nixekizumab.) \n \nInjection site reactions \nThe most frequent injection site reactions observed were erythema and pain. These reactions were \npredominantly mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of Taltz. \nIn the adult plaque psoriasis studies, injection site reactions were more common in subjects with a \nbody weight < 60 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 60 kg (25 % vs. 14 % for the \ncombined Q2W and Q4W groups). In the psoriatic arthritis studies, injection site reactions were more \ncommon in subjects with a body weight < 100 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 100 \nkg (24 % vs. 13 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). In the axial spondyloarthritis studies, \ninjection site reactions were similar in subjects with a body weight < 100 kg compared with the group \nwith a body weight ≥ 100 kg (14 % vs. 9 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). The increased \nfrequency of injection site reactions in the combined Q2W and Q4W groups did not result in an \nincrease in discontinuations in either the plaque psoriasis, the psoriatic arthritis or the axial \nspondyloarthritis studies. \n \nInfections \nIn the placebo-controlled period of the phase III clinical studies in plaque psoriasis in adults, infections \nwere reported in 27.2 % of patients treated with Taltz for up to 12 weeks compared with 22.9 % of \npatients treated with placebo.  \n \nThe majority of infections were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity, most of which did not \nnecessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 13 (0.6 %) of patients treated with \nTaltz and in 3 (0.4 %) of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). Over the entire treatment \nperiod infections were reported in 52.8 % of patients treated with Taltz (46.9 per 100 patient years). \nSerious infections were reported in 1.6 % of patients treated with Taltz (1.5 per 100 patient years). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nInfection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis clinical studies were similar to \nthose observed in the plaque psoriasis studies with the exception of the frequencies of the adverse \nreactions of influenza and conjunctivitis which were common in patients with psoriatic arthritis. \n \nLaboratory assessment of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia \nIn plaque psoriasis studies, 9% of patients receiving Taltz developed neutropenia. In most cases, the \nblood neutrophil count was ≥1,000 cells/mm3. Such levels of neutropenia may persist, fluctuate or be \ntransient. 0.1% of patients receiving Taltz developed a neutrophil count <1,000 cells/mm3.  In general, \nneutropenia did not require discontinuation of Taltz.  3% of patients exposed to Taltz had a shift from \na normal baseline platelet value to <150,000 platelet cells/mm3 to ≥75,000 cells/mm3. \nThrombocytopenia may persist, fluctuate or be transient. \n \nThe frequency of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis \nclinical studies is similar to that observed in the plaque psoriasis studies. \n \nImmunogenicity \nApproximately 9–17% of adult plaque psoriasis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing \nregimen developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titres and not associated with \nreduced clinical response up to 60 weeks of treatment. However, approximately 1% of patients treated \nwith Taltz had confirmed neutralising antibodies associated with low drug concentrations and reduced \nclinical response.  \n \nIn psoriatic arthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 52 weeks, \napproximately 11% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titre, and \napproximately 8% had confirmed neutralising antibodies. No apparent association between the \npresence of neutralising antibodies and impact on drug concentration or efficacy was observed. \n \nIn paediatric psoriasis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 12 weeks, \n21 patients (18%) developed anti-drug antibodies, approximately half were low titer and 5 patients \n(4%) had confirmed neutralizing antibodies associated with low drug concentrations. There was no \nassociation with clinical response or adverse events. \n \nIn radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen \nup to 16 weeks, 5.2% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titer, and 1.5% \n(3 patients) had neutralising antibodies (NAb). In these 3 patients, NAb-positive samples had low \nixekizumab concentrations and none of these patients achieved an ASAS40 response. In \nnon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing \nregimen for up to 52 weeks, 8.9% developed anti-drug antibodies, all of which were low titer; no \npatient had neutralising antibodies; and no apparent association between the presence of anti-drug \nantibodies and drug concentration, efficacy, or safety was observed. \n \nAcross all indications, an association between immunogenicity and treatment emergent adverse events \nhas not been clearly established. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile observed in children with plaque psoriasis treated with Taltz every 4 weeks is \nconsistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the \nfrequencies of conjunctivitis, influenza, and urticaria which were common. Inflammatory bowel \ndisease was also more frequent in paediatric patients, although it was still uncommon. In the paediatric \nclinical study, Crohn’s disease occurred in 0.9% of patients in the Taltz group and 0% of patients in \nthe placebo group during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period. Crohn’s disease occurred in a total \nof 4 Taltz treated subjects (2.0%) during the combined placebo-controlled and maintenance periods of \nthe paediatric clinical study. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 180 mg have been administered subcutaneously in clinical trials without dose-limiting \ntoxicity. Overdoses up to 240 mg, subcutaneously, as a single administration in clinical trials, have \nbeen reported without any serious adverse events. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the \npatient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic \ntreatment be instituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC13 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIxekizumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity (< 3 pM) and specificity to \ninterleukin 17A (both IL-17A and IL-17A/F). Elevated concentrations of IL-17A have been implicated \nin the pathogenesis of psoriasis by promoting keratinocyte proliferation and activation, as well as in \nthe pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis by driving inflammation leading to \nerosive bone damage and pathological new bone formation. Neutralisation of IL-17A by ixekizumab \ninhibits these actions. Ixekizumab does not bind to ligands IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E or \nIL-17F. \nIn vitro binding assays confirmed that ixekizumab does not bind to human Fcγ receptors I, IIa, and IIIa \nor to complement component C1q. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIxekizumab modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by IL-17A. Based on \npsoriatic skin biopsy data from a phase I study, there was a dose-related trend towards decreased \nepidermal thickness, number of proliferating keratinocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells, as well as \nreductions in local inflammatory markers from baseline to day 43. As a direct consequence treatment \nwith ixekizumab reduces erythema, induration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions. \n \nTaltz has been shown to lower (within 1 week of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, which is a \nmarker of inflammation.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdult plaque psoriasis \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Taltz were assessed in three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nphase III studies in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for \nphototherapy or systemic therapy (UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3). The efficacy and \nsafety of Taltz were also evaluated versus etanercept (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3). Patients \nrandomised to Taltz who were sPGA (0,1) responders (static Physicians Global Assessment) at \nWeek 12 were re-randomised to receive placebo or Taltz for an additional 48 weeks (UNCOVER-1 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nand UNCOVER-2); patients randomised to placebo, etanercept or Taltz who were sPGA (0,1) non-\nresponders received Taltz for up to 48 weeks. \n \nOf the 3,866 patients enrolled in these placebo-controlled studies, 64 % had received prior systemic \ntherapy (biologic, conventional systemic or psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA)), 43.5 % had received \nprior phototherapy, 49.3 % had received prior conventional systemic therapy, and 26.4 % had received \nprior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Of all patients, 14.9 % had received at least one \nanti-TNF alpha agent, and 8.7 % had received an anti-IL-12/IL-23. 23.4 % of patients had a history of \npsoriatic arthritis at baseline.  \n \nIn all three studies, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and an sPGA of 0 (“clear”) or 1 (“minimal”) response at \nWeek 12 versus placebo. Patients in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging \nfrom 17.4 to 18.3; 48.3 % to 51.2 % of patients had a baseline sPGA score of severe or very severe, \nand mean baseline itch Numeric Rating Scale (itch NRS) ranging from 6.3 to 7.1. \n \nClinical response at 12 weeks \nUNCOVER-1 enrolled 1,296 patients. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive either placebo or \nTaltz (80 mg every two or four weeks [Q2W or Q4W] following a 160 mg starting dose) for 12 weeks.  \n \nTable 2.

A significantly greater proportion of \npatients treated with Taltz achieved a DLQI 0 or 1. Across studies, Taltz was associated with \nstatistically significant improvement of itching severity assessed by the Itch NRS score. A \nsignificantly greater proportion of patients treated with Taltz achieved a reduction of Itch NRS ≥ 4 \npoints at week 12 (84.6% for Taltz Q2W, 79.2% for Taltz Q4W and 16.5% for placebo) and the \nbenefit was sustained over time up to Week 60 in patients treated with Taltz who were sPGA (0 or 1) \n\n\n\n15 \n\nresponders at Week 12. There was not any evidence of worsening of depression up to 60 weeks \ntreatment with Taltz as assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report. \n \nPostmarketing Phase 3b, direct comparative study \nEfficacy and safety of ixekizumab was also investigated in a double-blind study compared to \nustekinumab with ixekizumab being superior on the primary study objective (PASI 90 response at \nweek 12, Table 6).

Patients had at least moderate \nplaque psoriasis (defined as sPGA score of ≥ 3 and being candidates for phototherapy and/or systemic \ntherapy) for at least 6 months.  \n \nSubjects randomized to Taltz received an initial dose of 160 mg followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks for \n12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved at least a \"0\" (clear) or \n\"1\" (minimal) response on the sPGA of Genitalia (sPGA of Genitalia 0/1). At Week 12, significantly \nmore subjects in the Taltz group than placebo group achieved a sPGA of Genitalia 0/1 and a sPGA 0/1 \nindependent of baseline BSA (baseline BSA 1% - <10% resp. ≥10%: sPGA of Genitalia ‘’0” or “1”: \nTaltz 71%, resp. 75%; placebo: 0%, resp. 13%). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated \nwith Taltz achieved a reduction in the PROs of severity of genital pain, genital itch, impact of genital \npsoriasis on sexual activity, and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nTable 7.

The difference between treatment groups was \napparent from as early as Week 4. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nThere were greater improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo in nail psoriasis (as \nmeasured by the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI=0: Taltz 18% (6/34), placebo 0% (0/12)]), in \nscalp psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI=0: Taltz 69% (70/102), placebo \n16% (8/50)]) and in palmoplantar psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Palmoplantar Severity Index \n[PPASI 75: Taltz 53% (9/17), placebo 11% (1/9)]). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Taltz were assessed in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nphase III studies in 780 patients with active psoriatic arthritis (≥3 swollen and ≥3 tender joints). \nPatients in these studies had a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (Classification Criteria for Psoriatic \nArthritis [CASPAR] criteria) for a median of 5.33 years. Randomised patients also had current plaque \npsoriasis skin lesions (94.0%) or a documented history of plaque psoriasis, with 12.1% of patients with \nmoderate to severe plaque psoriasis at baseline. Over 58.9% and 22.3% of the psoriatic arthritis \npatients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively. For both studies, the primary endpoint \nwas American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at Week 24. \n \nIn Psoriatic Arthritis Study 1 (SPIRIT-P1), patients naive to biologic therapy with active psoriatic \narthritis were randomised to subcutaneous injections of placebo, adalimumab 40 mg once every \n2 weeks (active control reference arm), Taltz 80 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), or 80 mg once every \n4 weeks (Q4W). Both Taltz regimens included a 160 mg starting dose. 85.3% of patients in this study \nhad received prior treatment with ≥1 cDMARD. 53% of patients had concomitant use of MTX at a \nmean weekly dose of 15.8 mg.  67% of patients who had concomitant use of MTX had a dose of 15 mg \nor greater. Patients in all treatment groups with an inadequate response at week 16 received rescue \ntherapy (modification to background therapy). Patients on Taltz Q2W or Q4W remained on their \noriginally assigned dose of Taltz. Patients receiving adalimumab or placebo were re-randomised 1:1 to \nTaltz Q2W or Q4W at week 16 or 24 based on responder status.  \n \nPsoriatic Arthritis Study 2 (SPIRIT-P2) enrolled patients who were previously treated with an anti-TNF \nagent and discontinued the anti-TNF agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNF-IR \npatients). Patients were randomised to subcutaneous injections of placebo, Taltz 80 mg once every \n2 weeks (Q2W), or 80 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W).  Both Taltz regimens included a 160 mg \nstarting dose. 56% and 35% of patients were inadequate responders to 1 anti-TNF or 2 anti-TNF, \nrespectively.  SPIRIT-P2 evaluated 363 patients, of whom 41% had concomitant use of MTX at a mean \nweekly dose of 16.1 mg. 73.2% of patients who had concomitant use of MTX had a dose of 15 mg or \ngreater. Patients in all treatment groups with an inadequate response at week 16 received rescue \ntherapy (modification to background therapy). Patients in Taltz Q2W or Q4W remained on their \noriginally assigned dose of Taltz. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised 1:1 to Taltz Q2W or \nQ4W at week 16 or 24 based on responder status. \n\nSigns and symptoms \nTreatment with Taltz resulted in significant improvement in measures of disease activity compared to \nplacebo at Week 24 (see Table 9). \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nTable 9.

Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing \nSpondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 and total back pain ≥4 on a numeric rating scale \ndespite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Across both studies at baseline, \npatients had symptoms of axial spondyloarthritis for a mean of 17 years (median of 16 years). At \nbaseline, approximately 32% of the patients were on a concomitant cDMARD. \nCOAST-V evaluated 341 biologic-naive patients, who were treated with either Taltz 80 mg or 160 mg \nat Week 0 followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 4 weeks (Q4W), adalimumab 40 mg every \n2 weeks, or with placebo. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised at Week 16 to receive Taltz \n(160 mg starting dose, followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W). Patients receiving adalimumab were \nre-randomised at Week 16 to receive Taltz (80 mg Q2W or Q4W). \nCOAST-W evaluated 316 patients who had prior experience with 1 or 2 TNF-inhibitors (90% were \ninadequate responders and 10% were intolerant to TNF inhibitors). All patients were treated with \nTaltz 80 or 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W, or with placebo. Patients receiving \nplacebo were re-randomised at Week 16 to receive Taltz (160 mg initial dose, followed by 80 mg \nQ2W or Q4W).  \nThe primary endpoint in both studies was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of \nSpondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at Week 16. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nClinical Response \nIn both studies, patients treated with Taltz 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W demonstrated greater \nimprovements in ASAS40 and ASAS20 responses compared to placebo at Week 16 (Table 11). \nResponses were similar in patients regardless of concomitant therapies. In COAST-W, responses were \nseen regardless of the number of prior TNF inhibitors. \n\n \nTable 11.

In addition, more patients on Taltz compared \nwith placebo achieved good health status (ASAS HI ≤5) at Week 16 and Week 52. \n \nImmunisations  \nIn a study in healthy subjects, no safety concerns were identified of two inactivated vaccines (tetanus \nand pneumococcal), received after two doses of ixekizumab (160 mg followed by a second dose of 80 \nmg two weeks later). However, the data concerning immunisation were insufficient to conclude on an \nadequate immune response to these vaccines following administration of Taltz. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Taltz \nin one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis/axial spondyloarthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing a single subcutaneous dose of ixekizumab in patients with psoriasis, mean peak \nconcentrations were achieved within 4 to 7 days, across a dose range of 5 to 160 mg. The mean (SD) \nmaximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ixekizumab, after the 160 mg starting dose, was \n19.9 (8.15) µg/ml. \n \nAfter the 160 mg starting dose, steady state was achieved by Week 8 with the 80 mg Q2W dosing \nregimen. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss, and C trough,ss estimates are 21.5 (9.16) µg/ml, and 5.23 (3.19) µg/ml. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nAfter switching from the 80 mg Q2W dosing regimen to the 80 mg Q4W dosing regimen at Week 12, \nsteady state would be achieved after approximately 10 weeks. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss estimates \nare 14.6 (6.04) µg/ml, and 1.87 (1.30) µg/ml. \n \nThe average bioavailability of ixekizumab after subcutaneous administration was 54 % to 90 % across \nanalyses. \n \nDistribution \n \nFrom population pharmacokinetic analyses, the mean total volume of distribution at steady state was \n7.11 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIxekizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino \nacids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous immunoglobulins. \n \nElimination \n \nIn the population PK analysis, mean serum clearance was 0.0161 L/hr. Clearance is independent of \ndose. The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, is \n13 days in patients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nExposure (AUC) increased proportionally over a dose range of 5 to 160 mg given as a subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \nPharmacokinetic Properties Across Indications \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Taltz were similar across the plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, \nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis indications. \n \nElderly \n \nOf the 4,204 plaque psoriasis patients exposed to Taltz in clinical studies, a total of 301 were 65 years \nof age or older and 36 patients were 75 years of age or older. Of the 1,118 psoriatic arthritis patients \nexposed to Taltz in clinical studies, a total of 122 patients were 65 years of age or older and 6 patients \nwere 75 years of age or older.  \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n = 94 for \nage ≥ 65 years and n = 12 for age ≥ 75 years), clearance in elderly patients and patients less than \n65 years of age was similar. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nSpecific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic \nimpairment on the PK of ixekizumab have not been conducted. Renal elimination of intact \nixekizumab, an IgG MAb, is expected to be low and of minor importance; similarly, IgG MAbs are \nmainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence \nclearance of ixekizumab. \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nPaediatric psoriasis patients (age 6 to less than 18 years) were administered ixekizumab at the \nrecommended paediatric dosing regimen for 12 weeks. Patients weighing >50 kg and 25 to 50 kg had \n\n\n\n28 \n\na mean ±SD steady-state trough concentration of 3.8 ±2.2 µg/ml and 3.9 ±2.4 µg/ml, respectively, at \nWeek 12. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data from cynomolgus monkeys revealed no special hazards for humans based on \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies, safety pharmacology evaluations, and reproductive and developmental \ntoxicity studies.  \n \nIxekizumab administration to cynomolgus monkeys for 39 weeks at subcutaneous doses up to \n50 mg/kg weekly produced no organ toxicity or undesirable effects on immune function (e.g. T-cell \ndependent antibody response and NK cell activity). A weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg to \nmonkeys is approximately 19 times the 160 mg starting dose of Taltz and in monkeys results in \nexposure (AUC) that is at least 61-fold higher than the predicted mean steady-state exposure in \nhumans administered the recommended dose regimen.  \n \nNon-clinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of \nixekizumab.  \n \nNo effects on reproductive organs, menstrual cycles or sperm were observed in sexually mature \ncynomolgus monkeys that received ixekizumab for 13 weeks at a weekly subcutaneous dose of \n50 mg/kg. \n \nIn developmental toxicity studies, ixekizumab was shown to cross the placenta and was present in the \nblood of offspring for up to 6 months of age. A higher incidence of postnatal mortality occurred in the \noffspring of monkeys given ixekizumab compared to concurrent controls. This was related primarily \nto early delivery or maternal neglect of offspring, common findings in nonhuman primate studies, and \nconsidered clinically irrelevant. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nTaltz is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates \nfor systemic therapy. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nTaltz is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children from the age \nof 6 years and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and adolescents who are candidates for \nsystemic therapy. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nTaltz, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic \narthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapies (see section 5.1). \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nAnkylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nTaltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis who have \nresponded inadequately to conventional therapy. \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nTaltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein \n(CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTaltz is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Taltz is indicated. \n \nPosology \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults \nThe recommended dose is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, \nfollowed by 80 mg (one injection) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then maintenance dosing of 80 mg \n(one injection) every 4 weeks (Q4W). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) \nEfficacy and safety data is not available in children below the age of 6 years (see section 5.1). \nAvailable data do not support a posology below a body weight of 25 kg. \nThe recommended dose given by subcutaneous injection in children is based on the following weight \ncategories: \n \n\nChildren’s Body \nWeight \n\nRecommended Starting \nDose (Week 0) \n\nRecommended Dose every \n4 weeks (Q4W) thereafter \n\nGreater than 50 kg  160 mg (two 80 mg injections) 80 mg \n25 to 50 kg 80 mg 40 mg \n\n \nIxekizumab doses of 40 mg must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare professional \nusing the commercial Taltz 80 mg/1 ml prefilled syringe. \nUse the Taltz 80 mg pre-filled pen only in those children that require a dose of 80 mg and do not \nrequire dose preparation. \nTaltz is not recommended for use in children with a body weight below 25 kg. Paediatric body weights \nmust be recorded and regularly re-checked prior to dosing. \n  \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe recommended dose is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, \nfollowed by 80 mg (one injection) every 4 weeks thereafter. For psoriatic arthritis patients with \nconcomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended dosing regimen is the same as for \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis (radiographic and non-radiographic) \nThe recommended dose is 160 mg (two 80 mg injections) by subcutaneous injection at Week 0, \nfollowed by 80 mg every 4 weeks (see section 5.1 for further information). \n \nFor all indications (plaque psoriasis in adults and children, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis) \nconsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after \n16 to 20 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initially partial response may subsequently improve \nwith continued treatment beyond 20 weeks. \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 75 years. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nTaltz has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (below a body weight of 25 kg and below the age of 6 years) \nThere is no relevant use of Taltz in children below a body weight of 25 kg and below the age of \n6 years in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPaediatric psoriatic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of Taltz in children and adolescents aged 2 to less than 18 years in the \ntreatment of psoriatic arthritis (a category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis) have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. There is no relevant use of Taltz in children below 2 years for the \nindication of psoriatic arthritis. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSubcutaneous use. \nTaltz is for subcutaneous injection. Injection sites may be alternated. If possible, areas of the skin that \nshow psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The solution/the pen must not be shaken. \n \nAfter proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Taltz if a healthcare \nprofessional determines that it is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate \nfollow-up of patients. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet \nand the user manual.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSerious hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nClinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nTreatment with Taltz is associated with an increased rate of infections such as upper respiratory tract \ninfection, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis, and tinea infections (see section 4.8). \n \nTaltz should be used with caution in patients with clinically important chronic infection or a history of \nrecurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms \nsuggestive of an infection occur. If an infection develops, monitor carefully and discontinue Taltz if \nthe patient is not responding to standard therapy or if the infection becomes serious. Taltz should not \nbe resumed until the infection resolves. \n \nTaltz must not be given to patients with active tuberculosis (TB). Consider anti-TB therapy prior to \ninitiation of Taltz in patients with latent TB.  \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including some cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria and, \nrarely, late (10-14 days following injection) serious hypersensitivity reactions including widespread \nurticaria, dyspnea and high antibody titres have been reported.  If a serious hypersensitivity reaction \noccurs, administration of Taltz should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nInflammatory Bowel Disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) \n \nCases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with ixekizumab \n(see section 4.8). Ixekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a \npatient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of \n\n\n\n33 \n\npre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, ixekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical \nmanagement should be initiated. \n \nImmunisations \n \nTaltz should not be used with live vaccines. No data are available on the response to live vaccines; \nthere are insufficient data on response to inactive vaccines (see section 5.1). \n \nExcipients  \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 80 mg dose, i.e., essentially \n“sodium-free”.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn plaque psoriasis studies, the safety of Taltz in combination with other immunomodulatory agents or \nphototherapy has not been evaluated. \nIn population pharmacokinetic analyses, drug clearance of ixekizumab was not affected by \nconcomitant administration of oral corticosteroids, NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, or methotrexate. \n \nCytochrome P450 Substrates \n \nResults from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis determined \nthat 12 weeks of administration of ixekizumab with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., midazolam), \nCYP2C9 (i.e., warfarin), CYP2C19 (i.e., omeprazole), CYP1A2 (i.e., caffeine) or CYP2D6 (i.e., \ndextromethorphan) does not have a clinically significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of these \ndrugs. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment \nand for at least 10 weeks after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of ixekizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do \nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is \npreferable to avoid the use of Taltz during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether ixekizumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after \ningestion. However, ixekizumab is excreted at low levels in the milk of cynomolgus monkeys. A \ndecision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Taltz taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of ixekizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTaltz has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were injection site reactions (15.5 %) \nand upper respiratory tract infections (16.4 %) (most frequently nasopharyngitis).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nADRs from clinical studies and postmarketing reports (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ \nclass. Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent \nreactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each ADR is based on \nthe following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nA total of 8,956 patients have been treated with Taltz in blinded and open-label clinical studies in \nplaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and other autoimmune conditions. Of these, \n6,385 patients were exposed to Taltz for at least one year, cumulatively representing \n19,833 adult patient years of exposure and 196 children cumulatively representing 207 patient years of \nexposure.  \nIn plaque psoriasis in adults a total of 3,119 patients were evaluated in clinical trials (2,328 patients on \nixekizumab).  \nIn psoriatic arthritis in adults a total of 678 patients were evaluated in clinical trials (454 patients on \nixekizumab). \nIn axial spondyloarthritis (radiographic and non-radiographic axSpA) a total of 868 patients were \nevaluated in clinical trials (574 patients on ixekizumab). \n \nTable 1.  List of adverse reactions in clinical studies and postmarketing reports \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations  \n \n\nVery Common Upper respiratory tract \ninfection \n\nCommon Tinea infection, Herpes \nsimplex (mucocutaneous) \n\nUncommon Influenza, Rhinitis, Oral \ncandidiasis, Conjunctivitis, \nCellulitis \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders  \n\nUncommon Neutropenia, \nThrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders  Uncommon  Angioedema \nRare Anaphylaxis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders  \n\nCommon Oropharyngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Common Nausea \nUncommon  Inflammatory bowel disease \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ndisorders  \n\nUncommon Urticaria, Rash, Eczema \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common Injection site reactionsa \n\na See section description of selected adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n(Based on adverse reactions data from 4,204 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis \n[4,729.7 patient years] and 1,117 patients with active psoriatic arthritis [1,050.6 patient years] and \n196  patients with paediatric psoriasis [207 patient years] who have received at least 1 dose of \nixekizumab.)   \n \nInjection site reactions \nThe most frequent injection site reactions observed were erythema and pain. These reactions were \npredominantly mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of Taltz. \nIn the adult plaque psoriasis studies, injection site reactions were more common in subjects with a \nbody weight < 60 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 60 kg (25 % vs. 14 % for the \ncombined Q2W and Q4W groups).  In the psoriatic arthritis studies, injection site reactions were more \ncommon in subjects with a body weight < 100 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 100 \nkg (24 % vs. 13 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). In the axial spondyloarthritis studies, \ninjection site reactions were similar in subjects with a body weight < 100 kg compared with the group \nwith a body weight ≥ 100 kg (14 % vs. 9 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). The increased \nfrequency of injection site reactions in the combined Q2W and Q4W groups did not result in an \nincrease in discontinuations in either the plaque psoriasis, the psoriatic arthritis or the axial \nspondyloarthritis studies. \n \nInfections \nIn the placebo-controlled period of the phase III clinical studies in plaque psoriasis in adults, infections \nwere reported in 27.2 % of patients treated with Taltz for up to 12 weeks compared with 22.9 % of \npatients treated with placebo.  \n \nThe majority of infections were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity, most of which did not \nnecessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 13 (0.6 %) of patients treated with \nTaltz and in 3 (0.4 %) of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). Over the entire treatment \nperiod infections were reported in 52.8 % of patients treated with Taltz (46.9 per 100 patient years). \nSerious infections were reported in 1.6 % of patients treated with Taltz (1.5 per 100 patient years). \n \nInfection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis clinical studies were similar to \nthose observed in the plaque psoriasis studies with the exception of the frequencies of the adverse \nreactions of influenza and conjunctivitis which were common in patients with psoriatic arthritis. \n \nLaboratory assessment of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia \nIn plaque psoriasis studies, 9% of patients receiving Taltz developed neutropenia. In most cases, the \nblood neutrophil count was ≥1,000 cells/mm3. Such levels of   neutropenia may persist, fluctuate or be \ntransient. 0.1% of patients receiving Taltz developed a neutrophil count <1,000 cells/mm3.  In general, \nneutropenia did not require discontinuation of Taltz.  3% of patients exposed to Taltz had a shift from \na normal baseline platelet value to <150,000 platelet cells/mm3 to ≥75,000 cells/mm3. \nThrombocytopenia may persist, fluctuate or be transient. \n \nThe frequency of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis \nclinical studies is similar to that observed in the plaque psoriasis studies. \n \nImmunogenicity \nApproximately 9–17% of adult plaque psoriasis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing \nregimen developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titres and not associated with \nreduced clinical response up to 60 weeks of treatment. However, approximately 1% of patients treated \nwith Taltz had confirmed neutralising antibodies associated with low drug concentrations and reduced \nclinical response.  \n \nIn psoriatic arthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 52 weeks, \napproximately 11% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titre, and \n\n\n\n36 \n\napproximately 8% had confirmed neutralising antibodies. No apparent association between the \npresence of neutralising antibodies and impact on drug concentration or efficacy was observed. \n \nIn paediatric psoriasis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 12 weeks, \n21 patients (18%) developed anti-drug antibodies, approximately half were low titer and 5 patients \n(4%) had confirmed neutralizing antibodies associated with low drug concentrations.  There was no \nassociation with clinical response or adverse events. \n \nIn radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen \nup to 16 weeks, 5.2% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titer, and 1.5% \n(3 patients) had neutralising antibodies (NAb). In these 3 patients, NAb-positive samples had low \nixekizumab concentrations and none of these patients achieved an ASAS40 response. In \nnon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing \nregimen for up to 52 weeks, 8.9% developed anti-drug antibodies, all of which were low titer; no \npatient had neutralising antibodies; and no apparent association between the presence of anti-drug \nantibodies and drug concentration, efficacy, or safety was observed. \n \nAcross all indications, an association between immunogenicity and treatment emergent adverse events \nhas not been clearly established. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile observed in children with plaque psoriasis treated with Taltz every 4 weeks is \nconsistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the \nfrequencies of conjunctivitis, influenza, and urticaria which were common. Inflammatory bowel \ndisease was also more frequent in paediatric patients, although it was still uncommon. In the paediatric \nclinical study, Crohn’s disease occurred in 0.9% of patients in the Taltz group and 0% of patients in \nthe placebo group during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period. Crohn’s disease occurred in a total \nof 4 Taltz treated subjects (2.0%) during the combined placebo-controlled and maintenance periods of \nthe paediatric clinical study. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 180 mg have been administered subcutaneously in clinical trials without dose-limiting \ntoxicity. Overdoses up to 240 mg, subcutaneously, as a single administration in clinical trials, have \nbeen reported without any serious adverse events. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the \npatient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic \ntreatment be instituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC13 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIxekizumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity (< 3 pM) and specificity to \ninterleukin 17A (both IL-17A and IL-17A/F). Elevated concentrations of IL-17A have been implicated \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n37 \n\nin the pathogenesis of psoriasis by promoting keratinocyte proliferation and activation, as well as in \nthe pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis by driving inflammation leading to \nerosive bone damage and pathological new bone formation. Neutralisation of IL-17A by ixekizumab \ninhibits these actions. Ixekizumab does not bind to ligands IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E or \nIL-17F. \n \nIn vitro binding assays confirmed that ixekizumab does not bind to human Fcγ receptors I, IIa, and IIIa \nor to complement component C1q. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIxekizumab modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by IL-17A. Based on \npsoriatic skin biopsy data from a phase I study, there was a dose-related trend towards decreased \nepidermal thickness, number of proliferating keratinocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells, as well as \nreductions in local inflammatory markers from baseline to day 43. As a direct consequence treatment \nwith ixekizumab reduces erythema, induration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions. \n \nTaltz has been shown to lower (within 1 week of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, which is a \nmarker of inflammation.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdult plaque psoriasis \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Taltz were assessed in three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nphase III studies in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for \nphototherapy or systemic therapy (UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3). The efficacy and \nsafety of Taltz were also evaluated versus etanercept (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3). Patients \nrandomised to Taltz who were sPGA (0,1) responders (static Physicians Global Assessment) at \nWeek 12 were re-randomised to receive placebo or Taltz for an additional 48 weeks (UNCOVER-1 \nand UNCOVER-2); patients randomised to placebo, etanercept or Taltz who were sPGA (0,1) non-\nresponders received Taltz for up to 48 weeks. \n \nOf the 3,866 patients enrolled in these placebo-controlled studies, 64 % had received prior systemic \ntherapy (biologic, conventional systemic or psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA)), 43.5 % had received \nprior phototherapy, 49.3 % had received prior conventional systemic therapy, and 26.4 % had received \nprior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Of all patients, 14.9 % had received at least one \nanti-TNF alpha agent, and 8.7 % had received an anti-IL-12/IL-23. 23.4 % of patients had a history of \npsoriatic arthritis at baseline.  \n \nIn all three studies, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and an sPGA of 0 (“clear”) or 1 (“minimal”) response at \nWeek 12 versus placebo. Patients in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging \nfrom 17.4 to 18.3; 48.3 % to 51.2 % of patients had a baseline sPGA score of severe or very severe, \nand mean baseline itch Numeric Rating Scale (itch NRS) ranging from 6.3 to 7.1. \n \nClinical response at 12 weeks \nUNCOVER-1 enrolled 1,296 patients. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive either placebo or \nTaltz (80 mg every two or four weeks [Q2W or Q4W] following a 160 mg starting dose) for 12 weeks.  \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nTable 2.

Among these patients, 71.5 % regained at least an sPGA (0,1) response within 12 weeks of \nrestarting treatment with Taltz 80 mg Q4W. \n \nSignificantly greater improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo and etanercept \nwere demonstrated in nail psoriasis (as measured by the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI]), in \nscalp psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI]) and in palmoplantar psoriasis \n(as measured by Psoriasis Palmoplantar Severity Index [PPASI]). These improvements in nail, scalp \nand palmoplantar psoriasis were maintained at Week 60 in patients treated with Taltz who were sPGA \n(0,1) responders at Week 12. \n \nQuality of Life/Patient-Reported Outcomes \nAt Week 12 and across studies, Taltz was associated with statistically significant improvement in \nHealth-related Quality of Life as assessed by mean decrease ranges from baseline in the Dermatology \nLife Quality Index (DLQI) (Taltz 80 mg Q2W from -10.2 to -11.1, Taltz 80 mg Q4W from -9.4 to -\n10.7, etanercept from  -7.7 to -8.0 and placebo -1.0 to -2.0). A significantly greater proportion of \npatients treated with Taltz achieved a DLQI 0 or 1. Across studies, Taltz was associated with \nstatistically significant improvement of itching severity  assessed by the Itch NRS score. A \nsignificantly greater proportion of patients treated with Taltz achieved a reduction of Itch NRS ≥ 4 \npoints at week 12 (84.6% for Taltz Q2W, 79.2% for Taltz Q4W and 16.5% for placebo) and the \nbenefit was sustained over time up to Week 60 in patients treated with Taltz who were sPGA (0 or 1) \n\n\n\n43 \n\nresponders at Week 12. There was not any evidence of worsening of depression up to 60 weeks \ntreatment with Taltz as assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report. \n \nPostmarketing Phase 3b, direct comparative study \nEfficacy and safety of ixekizumab was also investigated in a double-blind study compared to \nustekinumab with ixekizumab being superior on the primary study objective (PASI 90 response at \nweek 12, Table 6). Onset of response was superior on PASI 75 as early as week 2 (p < 0.001) and on \nPASI 90 and PASI 100 by week 4 (p < 0.001). Superiority of ixekizumab versus ustekinumab was also \ndemonstrated in the subgroups stratified by weight. \n \nTable 6.

Patients had at least moderate \nplaque psoriasis (defined as sPGA score of ≥ 3 and being candidates for phototherapy and/or systemic \ntherapy) for at least 6 months.  \n \nSubjects randomized to Taltz received an initial dose of 160 mg followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks for \n12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved at least a \"0\" (clear) or \n\"1\" (minimal) response on the sPGA of Genitalia (sPGA of Genitalia 0/1). At Week 12, significantly \nmore subjects in the Taltz group than placebo group achieved a sPGA of Genitalia 0/1 and a sPGA 0/1 \nindependent of baseline BSA (baseline BSA 1% - <10% resp. ≥10%: sPGA of Genitalia ‘’0” or “1”: \nTaltz 71%, resp. 75%; placebo: 0%, resp. 13%). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated \nwith Taltz achieved a reduction in the PROs of severity of genital pain, genital itch, impact of genital \npsoriasis on sexual activity, and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI). \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nTable 7.

The difference between treatment groups was \napparent from as early as Week 4. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nThere were greater improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo in nail psoriasis (as \nmeasured by the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI=0: Taltz 18% (6/34), placebo 0% (0/12)]), in \nscalp psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI=0: Taltz 69% (70/102), placebo \n16% (8/50)]) and in palmoplantar psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Palmoplantar Severity Index \n[PPASI 75: Taltz 53% (9/17), placebo 11% (1/9)]). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Taltz were assessed in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nphase III studies in 780 patients with active psoriatic arthritis (≥3 swollen and ≥3 tender joints). \nPatients in these studies had a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (Classification Criteria for Psoriatic \nArthritis [CASPAR] criteria) for a median of 5.33 years. Randomised patients also had current plaque \npsoriasis skin lesions (94.0%) or a documented history of plaque psoriasis, with 12.1% of patients with \nmoderate to severe plaque psoriasis at baseline. Over 58.9% and 22.3% of the psoriatic arthritis \npatients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively. For both studies, the primary endpoint \nwas American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at Week 24. \n \nIn Psoriatic Arthritis Study 1 (SPIRIT-P1), patients naive to biologic therapy with active psoriatic \narthritis were randomised to subcutaneous injections of placebo, adalimumab 40 mg once every \n2 weeks (active control reference arm), Taltz 80 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), or 80 mg once every \n4 weeks (Q4W). Both Taltz regimens included a 160 mg starting dose. 85.3% of patients in this study \nhad received prior treatment with ≥1 cDMARD. 53% of patients had concomitant use of MTX at a \nmean weekly dose of 15.8 mg.  67% of patients who had concomitant use of MTX had a dose of 15 mg \nor greater. Patients in all treatment groups with an inadequate response at week 16 received rescue \ntherapy (modification to background therapy). Patients on Taltz Q2W or Q4W remained on their \noriginally assigned dose of Taltz. Patients receiving adalimumab or placebo were re-randomised 1:1 to \nTaltz Q2W or Q4W at week 16 or 24 based on responder status.  \n \nPsoriatic Arthritis Study 2 (SPIRIT-P2) enrolled patients who were previously treated with an anti-TNF \nagent and discontinued the anti-TNF agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNF-IR \npatients). Patients were randomised to subcutaneous injections of placebo, Taltz 80 mg once every \n2 weeks (Q2W), or 80 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W).  Both Taltz regimens included a 160 mg \nstarting dose. 56% and 35% of patients were inadequate responders to 1 anti-TNF or 2 anti-TNF, \nrespectively.  SPIRIT-P2 evaluated 363 patients, of whom 41% had concomitant use of MTX at a mean \nweekly dose of 16.1 mg. 73.2% of patients who had concomitant use of MTX had a dose of 15 mg or \ngreater. Patients in all treatment groups with an inadequate response at week 16 received rescue \ntherapy (modification to background therapy).

Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing \nSpondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 and total back pain ≥4 on a numeric rating scale \ndespite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Across both studies at baseline, \npatients had symptoms of axial spondyloarthritis for a mean of 17 years (median of 16 years). At \nbaseline, approximately 32% of the patients were on a concomitant cDMARD.  \nCOAST-V evaluated 341 biologic-naive patients, who were treated with either Taltz 80 mg or 160 mg \nat Week 0 followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 4 weeks (Q4W), adalimumab 40 mg every \n2 weeks, or with placebo. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised at Week 16 to receive Taltz \n(160 mg starting dose, followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W). Patients receiving adalimumab were \nre-randomised at Week 16 to receive Taltz (80 mg Q2W or Q4W). \nCOAST-W evaluated 316 patients who had prior experience with 1 or 2 TNF-inhibitors (90% were \ninadequate responders and 10% were intolerant to TNF inhibitors). All patients were treated with \nTaltz 80 or 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W, or with placebo. Patients receiving \nplacebo were re-randomised at Week 16 to receive Taltz (160 mg initial dose, followed by 80 mg \nQ2W or Q4W).  \nThe primary endpoint in both studies was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of \nSpondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at Week 16. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \nClinical Response \nIn both studies, patients treated with Taltz 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W demonstrated greater \nimprovements in ASAS40 and ASAS20 responses compared to placebo at Week 16 (Table 11). \nResponses were similar in patients regardless of concomitant therapies.

An \nASAS40 response is defined as a ≥40% improvement and an absolute improvement from baseline of \n≥2 units in ≥3 of 4 domains without any worsening in the remaining domain. \n\ne Primary endpoint at Week 16. \nf The numbers of ITT patients with MRI data at baseline and Week 16 are as follows: Taltz, n = 85; \n\nPBO, n = 90.  \ng Patients with missing data were counted as non-responders. Percentages are based on the number of \n\npatients in the ITT population with baseline ASDAS ≥2.1. \nh The reported values are difference in %( 95% CI) for categorical variables, and difference in \n\nLSM(95% CI) for continuous variables. \n* p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001 compared with placebo. \n \nThe improvement in the main components of the ASAS40 response criteria (spinal pain, BASFI, \npatient global assessment, stiffness) and other measures of disease activity demonstrated significant \nclinical improvement at Week 16. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nThe percent of patients achieving ASAS40 response by visit is shown in Figure 6. \n \nFigure 6. ASAS40 Response through Week 16 in COAST-X, NRIa \n\n \n\na Patients with missing data were counted as non-responders. \n** p<0.01 compared with placebo. \n \nIn COAST-X efficacy was maintained up to Week 52 as assessed by the endpoints presented in \nTable 12.  \n \nHealth-Related Outcomes \nSpinal pain showed improvements versus placebo as early as Week 1 and was maintained through \nWeek 16 [Taltz vs placebo: COAST-X: -2.4 vs -1.5]. In addition, more patients on Taltz compared \nwith placebo achieved good health status (ASAS HI ≤5) at Week 16 and Week 52. \n \nImmunisations  \nIn a study in healthy subjects, no safety concerns were identified of two inactivated vaccines (tetanus \nand pneumococcal), received after two doses of ixekizumab (160 mg followed by a second dose of \n80  mg two weeks later). However, the data concerning immunisation were insufficient to conclude on \nan adequate immune response to these vaccines following administration of Taltz. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Taltz \nin one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis/axial spondyloarthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing a single subcutaneous dose of ixekizumab in patients with psoriasis, mean peak \nconcentrations were achieved within 4 to 7 days, across a dose range of 5 to 160 mg. The mean (SD) \nmaximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ixekizumab, after the 160 mg starting dose, was \n19.9 (8.15) µg/ml. \n \nAfter the 160 mg starting dose, steady state was achieved by Week 8 with the 80 mg Q2W dosing \nregimen. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss, and C trough,ss estimates are 21.5 (9.16) µg/ml, and 5.23 (3.19) µg/ml. \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \nAfter switching from the 80 mg Q2W dosing regimen to the 80 mg Q4W dosing regimen at Week 12, \nsteady state would be achieved after approximately 10 weeks. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss estimates \nare 14.6 (6.04) µg/ml, and 1.87 (1.30) µg/ml. \n \nThe average bioavailability of ixekizumab after subcutaneous administration was 54 % to 90 % across \nanalyses. \n \nDistribution \n \nFrom population pharmacokinetic analyses, the mean total volume of distribution at steady state was \n7.11 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIxekizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino \nacids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous immunoglobulins. \n \nElimination \n \nIn the population PK analysis, mean serum clearance was 0.0161 L/hr. Clearance is independent of \ndose. The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, is \n13 days in patients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nExposure (AUC) increased proportionally over a dose range of 5 to 160 mg given as a subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \nPharmacokinetic Properties Across Indications \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Taltz were similar across the plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, \nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis indications. \n \nElderly \n \nOf the 4,204 plaque psoriasis patients exposed to Taltz in clinical studies, a total of 301 were 65 years \nof age or older and 36 patients were 75 years of age or older. Of the 1,118 psoriatic arthritis patients \nexposed to Taltz in clinical studies, a total of 122 patients were 65 years of age or older and 6 patients \nwere 75 years of age or older.  \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n = 94 for \nage ≥ 65 years and n = 12 for age ≥ 75 years), clearance in elderly patients and patients less than \n65 years of age was similar. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nSpecific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic \nimpairment on the PK of ixekizumab have not been conducted. Renal elimination of intact \nixekizumab, an IgG MAb, is expected to be low and of minor importance; similarly, IgG MAbs are \nmainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence \nclearance of ixekizumab. \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nPaediatric psoriasis patients (age 6 to less than 18 years) were administered ixekizumab at the \nrecommended paediatric dosing regimen for 12 weeks. Patients weighing >50 kg and 25 to 50 kg had \n\n\n\n56 \n\na mean ±SD steady-state trough concentration of 3.8 ±2.2 µg/ml and 3.9 ±2.4 µg/ml, respectively, at \nWeek 12. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data from cynomolgus monkeys revealed no special hazards for humans based on repeat-\ndose toxicity studies, safety pharmacology evaluations, and reproductive and developmental toxicity \nstudies.  \n \nIxekizumab administration to cynomolgus monkeys for 39 weeks at subcutaneous doses up to \n50 mg/kg weekly produced no organ toxicity or undesirable effects on immune function (e.g. T-cell \ndependent antibody response and NK cell activity). A weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg to \nmonkeys is approximately 19 times the 160 mg starting dose of Taltz and in monkeys results in \nexposure (AUC) that is at least 61-fold higher than the predicted mean steady-state exposure in \nhumans administered the recommended dose regimen.  \n \nNon-clinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of \nixekizumab.  \n \nNo effects on reproductive organs, menstrual cycles or sperm were observed in sexually mature \ncynomolgus monkeys that received ixekizumab for 13 weeks at a weekly subcutaneous dose of \n50 mg/kg. \n \nIn developmental toxicity studies, ixekizumab was shown to cross the placenta and was present in the \nblood of offspring for up to 6 months of age. A higher incidence of postnatal mortality occurred in the \noffspring of monkeys given ixekizumab compared to concurrent controls. This was related primarily \nto early delivery or maternal neglect of offspring, common findings in nonhuman primate studies, and \nconsidered clinically irrelevant. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n69 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nTaltz 80 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe  \nixekizumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Taltz is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Taltz \n3. How to use Taltz \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Taltz \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Taltz is and what it is used for \n \nTaltz contains the active substance ixekizumab.  \n \nTaltz is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: \n\n• Plaque psoriasis in adults \n• Plaque psoriasis in children from the age of 6 and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in \n\nadolescents \n• Psoriatic arthritis in adults \n• Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis \n• Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis  \n\n \nIxekizumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine \nworks by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which promotes psoriasis and \ninflammatory disease of the joints and the spine. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nTaltz is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis” in adults and in children from the age \nof 6 years and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents with moderate to severe \ndisease. Taltz reduces the signs and symptoms of the disease.  \n \nUsing Taltz will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms \nsuch as scaling, itching and pain. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \nTaltz is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis” in adults, an inflammatory disease of the \njoints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other \nmedicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Taltz to reduce the \n\n\n\n70 \n\nsigns and symptoms of the disease. Taltz can be used alone or with another medicine named \nmethotrexate. \n \nUsing Taltz will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the disease, improving physical \nfunction (ability to do normal daily activities), and slowing down the damage to the joints. \n \nAxial Spondyloarthritis \nTaltz is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which causes \ninflammation of the spinal joints, called Axial Spondyloarthritis. If the condition is visible using \nX-rays, it is referred to as “radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis”; if it occurs in patients with no \nvisible signs on X-rays, it is referred to as “non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis”. If you have \nAxial Spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce \ninflammation and improve your physical function. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Taltz \n \nDo not use Taltz \n- if you are allergic to ixekizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice before using Taltz. \n- if you have an infection which your doctor thinks is important (for example, active \n\ntuberculosis). \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Taltz:  \n \n- if you currently have an infection or if you have long-term or repeated infections. \n- if you have an inflammatory disease affecting the gut named Crohn’s disease. \n- if you have an inflammation of the large intestine named ulcerative colitis. \n- if you are receiving any other treatment for psoriasis (such as immunosuppressant or \n\nphototherapy with ultraviolet light) or for psoriatic arthritis. \n \nInflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) \nStop using Taltz and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice abdominal \ncramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool (any signs of bowel problems). \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or nurse before using Taltz. \n \nLook out for infections and allergic reactions \nTaltz can potentially cause serious side effects, including infections and allergic reactions. You must \nlook out for signs of these conditions while you are using Taltz. \n \nStop using Taltz and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs of a \nserious infection or an allergic reaction. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in \nsection 4. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTaltz is not recommended for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in children under 6 years of age \nbecause it has not been studied in this age group. \n \nTaltz is not recommended for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis in children and adolescents under \n18 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group. \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\nOther medicines and Taltz \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse  \n- if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicine. \n- if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain \n\ntypes of vaccines while using Taltz. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before using this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Taltz in pregnancy. The effects \nof this medicine in pregnant women are not known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you \nare advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Taltz and for at \nleast 10 weeks after the last Taltz dose.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. \nYou and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Taltz.

What Taltz is and what it is used for \n \nTaltz contains the active substance ixekizumab.  \n \nTaltz is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: \n\n• Plaque psoriasis in adults \n• Plaque psoriasis in children from the age of 6 and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in \n\nadolescents \n• Psoriatic arthritis in adults \n• Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis \n• Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis  \n\n \nIxekizumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine \nworks by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which promotes psoriasis and \ninflammatory disease of the joints and the spine. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nTaltz is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis” in adults and in children from the age \nof 6 years and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents with moderate to severe \ndisease. Taltz reduces the signs and symptoms of the disease.  \n \nUsing Taltz will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms \nsuch as scaling, itching and pain. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \nTaltz is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis” in adults, an inflammatory disease of the \njoints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other \nmedicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Taltz to reduce the \n\n\n\n83 \n\nsigns and symptoms of the disease. Taltz can be used alone or with another medicine named \nmethotrexate. \n \nUsing Taltz will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the disease, improving physical \nfunction (ability to do normal daily activities), and slowing down the damage to the joints. \n \nAxial Spondyloarthritis \nTaltz is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which causes \ninflammation of the spinal joints, called Axial Spondyloarthritis. If the condition is visible using \nX-rays, it is referred to as “radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis”; if it occurs in patients with no \nvisible signs on X-rays, it is referred to as “non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis”. If you have \nAxial Spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce \ninflammation and improve your physical function. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Taltz \n \nDo not use Taltz \n- if you are allergic to ixekizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice before using Taltz. \n- if you have an infection which your doctor thinks is important (for example, active \n\ntuberculosis). \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Taltz:  \n \n- if you currently have an infection or if you have long-term or repeated infections. \n- if you have an inflammatory disease affecting the gut named Crohn’s disease. \n- if you have an inflammation of the large intestine named ulcerative colitis. \n- if you are receiving any other treatment for psoriasis (such as immunosuppressant or \n\nphototherapy with ultraviolet light) or for psoriatic arthritis. \n \nInflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) \nStop using Taltz and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice abdominal \ncramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool (any signs of bowel problems). \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or nurse before using Taltz. \n \nLook out for infections and allergic reactions \nTaltz can potentially cause serious side effects, including infections and allergic reactions. You must \nlook out for signs of these conditions while you are using Taltz. \n \nStop using Taltz and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs of a \nserious infection or an allergic reaction. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in \nsection 4. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTaltz is not recommended for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in children under 6 years of age \nbecause it has not been studied in this age group. \n \nTaltz is not recommended for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis in children and adolescents under \n18 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group. \n \n\n\n\n84 \n\nOther medicines and Taltz \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse  \n- if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicine. \n- if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain \n\ntypes of vaccines while using Taltz. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before using this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Taltz in pregnancy. The effects \nof this medicine in pregnant women are not known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you \nare advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Taltz and for at \nleast 10 weeks after the last Taltz dose.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. \nYou and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Taltz. You should not do both.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nTaltz is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nTaltz contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 80 mg dose, i.e., essentially “sodium-\nfree”.  \n \n \n3. How to use Taltz \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you.
