CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKyprolis in combination with either lenalidomide and dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone is \nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one \nprior therapy (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKyprolis treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapy. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose is calculated using the patient’s baseline body surface area (BSA). Patients with a BSA \ngreater than 2.2 m2 should receive a dose based upon a BSA of 2.2 m2. Dose adjustments do not need \nto be made for weight changes of less than or equal to 20%. \n \nKyprolis in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone \n \nWhen combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, Kyprolis is administered intravenously as a \n10 minute infusion, on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16), \nfollowed by a 12-day rest period (days 17 to 28) as shown in table 1. Each 28-day period is considered \none treatment cycle. \n \nKyprolis is administered at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 (maximum dose 44 mg) in cycle 1 on days 1 \nand 2. If tolerated, the dose should be increased on day 8 of cycle 1 to 27 mg/m2 (maximum dose \n60 mg). From cycle 13, the day 8 and 9 doses of Kyprolis are omitted. \n \nTreatment may be continued until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n \nTreatment with Kyprolis combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for longer than 18 cycles \nshould be based on an individual benefit/risk assessment, as the data on the tolerability and toxicity of \ncarfilzomib beyond 18 cycles are limited (see section 5.1). \n \nIn combination with Kyprolis, lenalidomide is administered as 25 mg orally on days 1-21 and \ndexamethasone is administered as 40 mg orally or intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the 28-day \ncycles. Appropriate dose reduction for the starting dose of lenalidomide should be considered \naccording to the recommendations in the current lenalidomide summary of product characteristics, for \nexample for patients with baseline renal impairment. Dexamethasone should be administered \n30 minutes to 4 hours before Kyprolis. \n \nTable 1.

Infusion time is 30 minutes and remains consistent throughout the regimen \n \nConcomitant medicinal products \n \nAntiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients being treated with Kyprolis to decrease the risk \nof herpes zoster reactivation (see section 4.8). \n \nThromboprophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with Kyprolis in combination with \ndexamethasone or with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, and should be based on an assessment of the \npatient’s underlying risks and clinical status. For other concomitant medicinal products that may be \n\n\n\n5 \n\nrequired, such as the use of antacid prophylaxis, refer to the current lenalidomide and dexamethasone \nsummary of product characteristics. \n \nHydration, fluid and electrolyte monitoring \n \nAdequate hydration is required before dose administration in cycle 1, especially in patients at high risk \nof tumour lysis syndrome or renal toxicity. All patients should be monitored for evidence of volume \noverload and fluid requirements should be tailored to individual patient needs. The total volume of \nfluids may be adjusted as clinically indicated in patients with baseline cardiac failure or who are at risk \nfor cardiac failure (see section 4.4). \n \nRecommended hydration includes both oral fluids (30 mL/kg/day for 48 hours before day 1 of cycle 1) \nand intravenous fluids (250 mL to 500 mL of appropriate intravenous fluid before each dose in \ncycle 1). Give an additional 250 mL to 500 mL of intravenous fluids as needed following Kyprolis \nadministration in cycle 1. Oral and/or intravenous hydration should be continued, as needed, in \nsubsequent cycles. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored monthly, or more frequently during treatment with \nKyprolis as clinically indicated and will depend on the potassium levels measured before the start of \ntreatment, concomitant therapy used (e.g. medicinal products known to increase the risk of \nhypokalaemia) and associated comorbidities. \n \nRecommended dose modifications \n \nDosing should be modified based on Kyprolis toxicity. Recommended actions and dose modifications \nare presented in table 3. Dose level reductions are presented in table 4. \n \nTable 3. Dose modifications during Kyprolis treatment \n \n\nHaematologic toxicity Recommended action \n Absolute neutrophil count \n\n< 0.5 × 109/L (see section 4.4)  \n Stop dose \n\n- If recovered to ≥ 0.5 × 109/L, continue at same dose \nlevel \n\n For subsequent drops to < 0.5 × 109/L, follow the same \nrecommendations as above and consider 1 dose level \nreduction when restarting Kyprolisa\n\n Febrile neutropenia \n Absolute neutrophil count \n\n< 0.5 × 109/L and an oral \ntemperature > 38.5°C or two \nconsecutive readings of > 38.0°C \nfor 2 hours \n\n Stop dose \n If absolute neutrophil count returns to baseline grade and \n\nfever resolves, resume at the same dose level \n\n Platelet count < 10 × 109/L or \nevidence of bleeding with \nthrombocytopenia (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n Stop dose \n- If recovered to ≥ 10 × 109/L and/or bleeding is \n\ncontrolled continue at same dose level \n For subsequent drops to < 10 × 109/L, follow the same \n\nrecommendations as above and consider 1 dose level \nreduction when restarting Kyprolisa\n\nNon-haematologic toxicity (renal) Recommended action \n Serum creatinine equal to or \n\ngreater than 2 × baseline; or \n Creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min \n\n(or creatinine clearance decreases \nto ≤ 50% of baseline) or need for \ndialysis (see section 4.4) \n\n Stop dose and continue monitoring renal function (serum \ncreatinine or creatinine clearance) \n- Kyprolis should be resumed when renal function has \n\nrecovered to within 25% of baseline; consider \nresuming at 1 dose level reductiona \n\n For patients on dialysis receiving Kyprolis, the dose is to be \nadministered after the dialysis procedure \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOther non-haematologic toxicity Recommended action \n All other grade 3 or 4 \n\nnon-haematologic toxicities  \n(see section 4.4) \n\n Stop until resolved or returned to baseline \n Consider restarting the next scheduled treatment at 1 dose \n\nlevel reductiona\na.

If symptoms do not resolve, discontinue Kyprolis treatment \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPatients with moderate or severe renal impairment were enrolled in Kyprolis-dexamethasone \ncombination studies, but were excluded from Kyprolis-lenalidomide combination studies. Thus, there \nare limited data for Kyprolis in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with \ncreatinine clearance (CrCL < 50 mL/min). Appropriate dose reduction for the starting dose of \nlenalidomide in patients with baseline renal impairment should be considered according to the \nrecommendations in the lenalidomide summary of product characteristics. \n \nNo starting dose adjustment for Kyprolis is recommended in patients with baseline mild, moderate, or \nsevere renal impairment or patients on chronic dialysis based on available pharmacokinetic data (see \nsection 5.2). However, in phase 3 clinical studies, the incidence of adverse events of acute renal failure \nwas higher in patients with lower baseline creatinine clearance than that among patients with higher \nbaseline creatinine clearance. \n \nRenal function should be assessed at treatment initiation and monitored at least monthly or in \naccordance with accepted clinical practice guidelines, particularly in patients with lower baseline \ncreatinine clearance (CrCL < 30 mL/min). Appropriate dose modifications based on toxicity should be \nmade (see table 3). There are limited efficacy and safety data on patients with baseline creatinine \nclearance < 30 mL/min. \n \nSince dialysis clearance of Kyprolis concentrations has not been studied, the medicinal product should \nbe administered after the dialysis procedure. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPatients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were excluded from Kyprolis studies in \ncombination with either lenalidomide and dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of Kyprolis has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nNo starting dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \nbased on available pharmacokinetic data. However, higher subject incidence of hepatic function \nabnormalities, ≥ grade 3 adverse events and serious adverse events have been reported in patients with \nmild or moderate baseline hepatic impairment compared with patients with normal hepatic function \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Liver enzymes and bilirubin should be assessed at treatment initiation and \nmonitored monthly during treatment with carfilzomib, regardless of baseline values, and appropriate \ndose modifications based on toxicity should be made (see table 3). Special attention should be paid to \n\n\n\n7 \n\npatients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment in view of the very limited efficacy and safety \ndata on this population. \n \nElderly patients \n \nOverall, the subject incidence of certain adverse events (including cardiac failure) in clinical studies \nwas higher for patients who were ≥ 75 years of age compared to patients who were < 75 years of age \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Kyprolis in paediatric patients have not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nKyprolis is to be administered by intravenous infusion. The 20/27 mg/m2 dose is administered over \n10 minutes. The 20/56 mg/m2 dose must be administered over 30 minutes. \n \nKyprolis must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nThe intravenous administration line should be flushed with normal sodium chloride solution or \n5% glucose solution for injection immediately before and after Kyprolis administration. \n \nDo not mix Kyprolis with or administer as an infusion with other medicinal products. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n Women who are breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \nAs Kyprolis is administered in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their summaries of \nproduct characteristics for additional contraindications. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs Kyprolis is administered in combination with other medicinal products, the summary of product \ncharacteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment with \nKyprolis. As lenalidomide may be used in combination with Kyprolis, particular attention to the \nlenalidomide pregnancy testing and prevention requirements is needed (see section 4.6). \n \nCardiac disorders \n \nNew or worsening cardiac failure (e.g. congestive cardiac failure, pulmonary oedema, decreased \nejection fraction), myocardial ischaemia and infarction have occurred following administration of \nKyprolis. Death due to cardiac arrest has occurred within a day of Kyprolis administration and fatal \noutcomes have been reported with cardiac failure and myocardial infarction. For potential dose-related \neffects, see section 4.8. \n \nWhile adequate hydration is required prior to dosing in cycle 1, all patients should be monitored for \nevidence of volume overload, especially patients at risk for cardiac failure. The total volume of fluids \nmay be adjusted as clinically indicated in patients with baseline cardiac failure or who are at risk for \ncardiac failure (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nStop Kyprolis for grade 3 or 4 cardiac events until recovery and consider whether to restart Kyprolis at \n1 dose level reduction based on a benefit/risk assessment (see section 4.2). \n \nThe risk of cardiac failure is increased in elderly patients (≥ 75 years). The risk of cardiac failure is \nalso increased in Asian patients. \n \nA thorough assessment for cardiovascular risk factors prior to starting treatment is recommended. \n \nPatients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV heart failure, recent myocardial \ninfarction, and conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by medicinal products were not eligible for the \nclinical studies. These patients may be at greater risk for cardiac complications. Patients with signs or \nsymptoms of NYHA Class III or IV cardiac failure, recent history of myocardial infarction (in the last \n4 months), and in patients with uncontrolled angina or arrhythmias, should have a comprehensive \ncardiological assessment, prior to starting treatment with Kyprolis. This assessment should optimise \nthe patient’s status, with particular attention to blood pressure control and fluid management. \nSubsequently patients should be treated with caution and remain under close follow-up. \n \nElectrocardiographic changes \n \nThere have been cases of QT interval prolongation reported in clinical studies. An effect of Kyprolis \non QT interval cannot be excluded (see section 5.1). \n \nPulmonary toxicity \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and acute diffuse infiltrative \npulmonary disease such as pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease have occurred in patients \nreceiving Kyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. Evaluate and stop Kyprolis until resolved \nand consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment (see section 4.2). \n \nPulmonary hypertension \n \nPulmonary hypertension has been reported in patients treated with Kyprolis. Some of these events \nhave been fatal. Evaluate as appropriate. Stop Kyprolis for pulmonary hypertension until resolved or \nreturned to baseline and consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDyspnoea \n \nDyspnoea was commonly reported in patients treated with Kyprolis. Evaluate dyspnoea to exclude \ncardiopulmonary conditions including cardiac failure and pulmonary syndromes. Stop Kyprolis for \ngrade 3 and 4 dyspnoea until resolved or returned to baseline and consider whether to restart Kyprolis \nbased on a benefit/risk assessment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nHypertension \n \nHypertension, including hypertensive crisis and hypertensive emergency, has been observed with \nKyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. It is recommended to control hypertension prior to \nstarting and during treatment. All patients should be routinely evaluated for hypertension while on \nKyprolis and treated as needed. If the hypertension cannot be controlled, the Kyprolis dose should be \nreduced. In case of hypertensive crises, stop Kyprolis until resolved or returned to baseline and \nconsider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment (see section 4.2). \n \nAcute renal failure \n \nCases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. Some of these \nevents have been fatal. Acute renal failure was reported more frequently in patients with advanced \nrelapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who received Kyprolis monotherapy. In phase 3 clinical \n\n\n\n9 \n\nstudies the incidence of adverse events of acute renal failure was higher in subjects with lower \nbaseline creatinine clearance than that among subjects with higher baseline creatinine \nclearance. Creatinine clearance was stable over time for the majority of patients. Renal function should \nbe monitored at least monthly or in accordance with accepted clinical practice guidelines, particularly \nin patients with lower baseline creatinine clearance. Reduce or stop dose as appropriate (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \n \nCases of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), including with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients \nwho received Kyprolis. Patients with a high tumour burden should be considered to be at greater risk \nfor TLS. Ensure that patients are well hydrated before administration of Kyprolis in cycle 1, and in \nsubsequent cycles as needed (see section 4.2). Uric acid lowering medicinal products should be \nconsidered in patients at high risk for TLS. Evidence of TLS during treatment should be monitored \nfor, including regular measurement of serum electrolytes, and managed promptly. Stop Kyprolis until \nTLS is resolved (see section 4.2). \n \nInfusion reactions \n \nInfusion reactions, including life-threatening reactions, have been reported in patients who received \nKyprolis. Symptoms may include fever, chills, arthralgia, myalgia, facial flushing, facial oedema, \nvomiting, weakness, shortness of breath, hypotension, syncope, chest tightness, or angina. These \nreactions can occur immediately following or up to 24 hours after administration of Kyprolis. \nDexamethasone should be administered prior to Kyprolis to reduce the incidence and severity of \nreactions (see section 4.2). \n \nHaemorrhage and thrombocytopenia \n \nCases of haemorrhage (e.g. gastrointestinal, pulmonary and intracranial haemorrhage) have been \nreported in patients treated with Kyprolis, often associated with thrombocytopenia. Some of these \nevents have been fatal (see section 4.8). \n \nKyprolis causes thrombocytopenia with platelet nadirs observed on day 8 or day 15 of each 28-day \ncycle with recovery to baseline platelet count by the start of the next cycle (see section 4.8). Platelet \ncounts should be monitored frequently during treatment with Kyprolis. Reduce or stop dose as \nappropriate (see section 4.2). \n \nVenous thromboembolic events \n \nCases of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism \nwith fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. \n \nPatients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – including prior thrombosis – should be \nclosely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimise all modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, \nhypertension and hyperlipidaemia). Caution should be used in the concomitant administration of other \nagents that may increase the risk of thrombosis (e.g. erythropoietic agents or hormone replacement \ntherapy). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of \nthromboembolism. Patients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such \nas shortness of breath, chest pain, haemoptysis, arm or leg swelling or pain. \n \nThromboprophylaxis should be considered based on an individual benefit/risk assessment. \n \nHepatic toxicity \n \nCases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported. Kyprolis can cause elevations of \nserum transaminases (see section 4.8). Reduce or stop dose as appropriate (see section 4.2). Liver \n\n\n\n10 \n\nenzymes and bilirubin should be monitored at treatment initiation and monthly during treatment with \ncarfilzomib, regardless of baseline values. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (TTP/HUS) have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. \nSome of these events have been fatal. Signs and symptoms of TTP/HUS should be monitored for. If \nthe diagnosis is suspected, stop Kyprolis and evaluate patients for possible TTP/HUS. If the diagnosis \nof TTP/HUS is excluded, Kyprolis can be restarted. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in \npatients previously experiencing TTP/HUS is not known. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported in patients \nreceiving Kyprolis. PRES, formerly termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome \n(RPLS), is a rare, neurological disorder, which can present with seizure, headache, lethargy, \nconfusion, blindness, altered consciousness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, along with \nhypertension, and the diagnosis is confirmed by neuro-radiological imaging. Kyprolis should be \ndiscontinued if PRES is suspected. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously \nexperiencing PRES is not known. \n \nHepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation \n \nCases of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation have been reported in patients receiving carfilzomib. \n \nAll patients should be screened for HBV before initiation of treatment with carfilzomib. For patients \nwith positive HBV serology, prophylaxis with antivirals should be considered. They should be \nmonitored for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV reactivation during and after the end of treatment. \nExperts in the treatment of HBV infection should be consulted, as necessary. The safety of resuming \ncarfilzomib, after HBV reactivation is adequately controlled, is not known. Therefore, resumption of \ntherapy should be discussed with experts in managing HBV. \n \nProgressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy \n \nCases of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported in patients receiving \ncarfilzomib who have had prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nPatients receiving carfilzomib should be monitored for any new or worsening neurologic, cognitive or \nbehavioural signs and symptoms that may be suggestive of PML as part of the differential diagnosis of \nCNS disorders. \n \nIf PML is suspected, further administration must be suspended until PML has been excluded by a \nspecialist with appropriate diagnostic testing. If PML is confirmed, carfilzomib must be discontinued. \n \nContraception \n \nFemale patients of childbearing potential (and/or their partners) must use effective contraception \nmeasures during and for one month following treatment. Male patients must use effective \ncontraception measures during and for 3 months following treatment if their partner is pregnant or of \nchildbearing potential and not using effective contraception (refer to section 4.6). Carfilzomib may \ndecrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives (refer to section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSodium content \n \nKyprolis 10 mg powder for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 37 mg sodium per 10 mg vial which is equivalent to 1.9% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nKyprolis 30 mg powder for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 109 mg sodium per 30 mg vial which is equivalent to 5.5% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nKyprolis 60 mg powder for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 216 mg sodium per 60 mg vial which is equivalent to 11% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nCyclodextrin content \n \nKyprolis 10 mg powder for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 500 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 10 mg vial \nwhich is equivalent to 88 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. \n \nKyprolis 30 mg powder for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 1,500 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 30 mg \nvial which is equivalent to 88 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. \n \nKyprolis 60 mg powder for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 3,000 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 60 mg \nvial which is equivalent to 88 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCarfilzomib is primarily metabolised via peptidase and epoxide hydrolase activities, and as a result, \nthe pharmacokinetic profile of carfilzomib is unlikely to be affected by concomitant administration of \ncytochrome P450 inhibitors and inducers. \n \nIn vitro studies indicated that carfilzomib did not induce human CYP3A4 in cultured human \nhepatocytes. A clinical study using oral midazolam as a CYP3A probe conducted with carfilzomib at a \ndose of 27 mg/m2 (2-10 minute infusion) demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of midazolam were \nunaffected by concomitant carfilzomib administration, indicating that carfilzomib is not expected to \ninhibit the metabolism of CYP3A4/5 substrates and is not a CYP3A4 inducer in human subjects. No \nclinical study was conducted with a dose of 56 mg/m2. However, it is unknown whether carfilzomib is \nan inducer of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6 at therapeutic concentrations. Caution should be \nobserved when carfilzomib is combined with medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes, \nsuch as oral contraceptives. Effective measures to avoid pregnancy should be taken (see section 4.6, \nand refer also to the current lenalidomide summary of product characteristics), an alternative method \nof effective contraception should be used if the patient is using oral contraceptives. \n \nCarfilzomib does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 in vitro and is therefore not \nexpected to influence exposure of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes as a result \nof inhibition. \n \nCarfilzomib is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not a BCRP substrate. However, given that Kyprolis is \nadministrated intravenously and is extensively metabolised, the pharmacokinetic profile of carfilzomib \nis unlikely to be affected by P-gp or BCRP inhibitors or inducers. In vitro, at concentrations (3 µM) \nlower than those expected at therapeutic doses, carfilzomib inhibits the efflux transport of digoxin, a \nP-gp substrate, by 25%. Caution should be observed when carfilzomib is combined with substrates of \nP-gp (e.g. digoxin, colchicine). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn vitro, carfilzomib inhibits OATP1B1 with an IC50 = 2.01 µM whereas it is unknown whether \ncarfilzomib may or not inhibit other transporters OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 and BSEP, at the \nsystemic level. Carfilzomib does not inhibit human UGT2B7 but inhibits human UGT1A1 with an \nIC50 of 5.5 µM. Nonetheless, considering the fast elimination of carfilzomib, notably a rapid decline in \nsystemic concentration 5 minutes after the end of infusion, the risk of clinically relevant interactions \nwith substrates of OATP1B1 and UGT1A1 is probably low. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child bearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nFemale patients of child bearing potential treated with Kyprolis (and/or their partners) must use \neffective contraception measures during and for one month following treatment. \n \nIt cannot be excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during carfilzomib \ntreatment (see section 4.5). In addition, due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events \nassociated with carfilzomib, females should avoid the use of hormonal contraceptives that are \nassociated with a risk of thrombosis during treatment with carfilzomib (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If a \npatient is currently using oral contraceptives or a hormonal method of contraception that is associated \nwith a risk of thrombosis, the patient should switch to an alternative method of effective contraception. \n \nMale patients must use effective contraception measures during and for 3 months following treatment \nif their partner is pregnant or of child bearing potential not using effective contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of carfilzomib in pregnant women. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nBased on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Kyprolis can cause foetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman. Kyprolis should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential \nbenefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. If Kyprolis is used during pregnancy, or if the patient \nbecomes pregnant while taking this medicinal product, the patient should be apprised of the potential \nhazard to the foetus. \n \nLenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active \nsubstance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a \nteratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected. The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention \nProgramme for lenalidomide must be fulfilled for all patients unless there is reliable evidence that the \npatient does not have child bearing potential. Please refer to the current lenalidomide summary of \nproduct characteristics. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether carfilzomib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Based on its \npharmacological properties, a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Consequently, as a \nprecautionary measure, breast-feeding is contra-indicated during and for at least 2 days after treatment \nwith Kyprolis. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility studies have been performed in animals (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKyprolis has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nFatigue, dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, somnolence and/or a drop in blood pressure have been \nobserved in clinical studies. Patients being treated with Kyprolis should be advised not to drive or \noperate machines in the event that they experience any of these symptoms. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nSerious adverse reactions that may occur during Kyprolis treatment include: cardiac failure, \nmyocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocardial ischaemia, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, \nacute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, dyspnoea, \nhypertension including hypertensive crises, acute kidney injury, tumour lysis syndrome, infusion \nrelated reaction, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage, pulmonary haemorrhage, \nthrombocytopenia, hepatic failure, hepatitis B virus reactivation, PRES, thrombotic microangiopathy \nand TTP/HUS. In clinical studies with Kyprolis, cardiac toxicity and dyspnoea typically occurred \nearly in the course of Kyprolis therapy (see section 4.4). The most common adverse reactions \n(occurring in > 20% of subjects) were: anaemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, nausea, diarrhoea, \npyrexia, dyspnoea, respiratory tract infection, cough and neutropenia. \n \nFollowing initial doses of carfilzomib at 20 mg/m2, the dose was increased to 27 mg/m2 in study \nPX-171-009 and to 56 mg/m2 in study 2011-003 (see section 5.1). A cross-study comparison of the \nadverse reactions occurring in the Kyprolis and dexamethasone (Kd) arm of study 2011-003 vs the \nKyprolis, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) arm of study PX-171-009 suggest that there may be \na potential dose relationship for the following adverse reactions: cardiac failure (Kd 8.2%, KRd 6.4%), \ndyspnoea (Kd 30.9%, KRd 22.7%), hypertension (Kd 25.9%, KRd 15.8%), and pulmonary \nhypertension (Kd 1.3%, KRd 0.8%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are presented below by system organ class and frequency category (see table 5). \nFrequency categories were determined from the crude incidence rate reported for each adverse \nreaction in a dataset of pooled clinical studies (n = 2,944). Within each system organ class and \nfrequency category, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 5.

These events typically occurred early in the \ncourse of Kyprolis therapy (< 5 cycles). For clinical management of cardiac disorders during Kyprolis \ntreatment, see section 4.4. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nDyspnoea \n \nDyspnoea was reported in approximately 30% of subjects in clinical studies with Kyprolis. The \nmajority of dyspnoea adverse reactions were non-serious (< 5% of subjects had grade ≥ 3 events), \nresolved, rarely resulted in treatment discontinuation, and had an onset early in the course of study \n(< 3 cycles). For clinical management of dyspnoea during Kyprolis treatment, see section 4.4. \n \nHypertension including hypertensive crises \n \nHypertensive crises (hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency) have occurred following \nadministration of Kyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. In clinical studies, hypertension \nadverse events occurred in approximately 20% of subjects and 7.5% of subjects had grade ≥ 3 \nhypertension events, but hypertensive crises occurred in < 0.5% of subjects. The incidence of \nhypertension adverse events was similar between those with or without a prior medical history of \nhypertension. For clinical management of hypertension during Kyprolis treatment, see section 4.4. \n \nThrombocytopenia \n \nThrombocytopenia was reported in approximately 34% of subjects in clinical studies with Kyprolis \nand approximately 20% of subjects had grade ≥ 3 events. Kyprolis causes thrombocytopenia through \ninhibition of platelet budding from megakaryocytes resulting in a classic cyclical thrombocytopenia \nwith platelet nadirs occurring on day 8 or 15 of each 28-day cycle and usually associated with \nrecovery to baseline by the start of the next cycle. For clinical management of thrombocytopenia \nduring Kyprolis treatment, see section 4.4. \n \nVenous thromboembolic events \n \nCases of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism \nwith fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis (see section 4.4). The \noverall incidence of venous thromboembolic events was higher in the Kyprolis arms of two phase 3 \nstudies. In study PX-171-009 the incidence of venous thromboembolic events was 15.6% in the KRd \narm and 9.0% in the Rd arm. Grade ≥ 3 venous thromboembolic events were reported in 5.6% of \npatients in the KRd arm and 3.9% of patients in the Rd arm. In study 2011-003 the incidence of \nvenous thromboembolic events was 12.5% in the Kd arm and 3.3% in the bortezomib plus \ndexamethasone (Vd) arm. Grade ≥ 3 venous thromboembolic events were reported in 3.5% of patients \nin the Kd arm and 1.8% of patients in the Vd arm. \n \nHepatic failure \n \nCases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported in < 1% of subjects in clinical \nstudies with Kyprolis. For clinical management of hepatic toxicity during Kyprolis treatment, see \nsection 4.4. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \n \nIn a randomised, open-label multicentre study in patients receiving Kyprolis 20/56 mg/m2 infused over \n30 minutes in combination with dexamethasone (Kd, n = 464) vs bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd, \nn = 465), cases of grade 2 and higher peripheral neuropathy were reported in 7% of patients with \nrelapsed multiple myeloma in the Kd arm, compared with 35% in the Vd arm at the time of the \npre-planned OS analysis. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nOther special populations \n \nElderly patients (≥ 75 years) \n \nOverall, the subject incidence of certain adverse events (including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure \n(see section 4.4), dyspnoea, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) in clinical studies with Kyprolis was \nhigher for patients who were ≥ 75 years of age compared to patients who were < 75 years of age. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the safety of doses higher than \nthose evaluated in clinical studies. Acute onset of chills, hypotension, renal insufficiency, \nthrombocytopenia and lymphopenia has been reported following a dose of 200 mg of Kyprolis \nadministered in error. \n \nThere is no known specific antidote for carfilzomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient \nshould be monitored, specifically for the adverse reactions to Kyprolis listed in section 4.8. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX45 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nCarfilzomib is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor that selectively and irreversibly binds \nto the N terminal threonine containing active sites of the 20S proteasome, the proteolytic core particle \nwithin the 26S proteasome, and displays little to no activity against other protease classes. Carfilzomib \nhad antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in preclinical models in haematologic tumours. In \nanimals, carfilzomib inhibited proteasome activity in blood and tissue and delayed tumour growth in \nmodels of multiple myeloma. In vitro, carfilzomib was found to have minimal neurotoxicity and \nminimal reaction to non-proteasomal proteases. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIntravenous carfilzomib administration resulted in suppression of proteasome chymotrypsin-like \n(CT-L) activity when measured in blood 1 hour after the first dose. Doses of ≥ 15 mg/m2 consistently \ninduced an (≥ 80%) inhibition of the CT-L activity of the proteasome. In addition, carfilzomib \nadministration resulted in inhibition of the latent membrane protein 2 (LMP2) and multicatalytic \nendopeptidase complex-like 1 (MECL1) subunits of the immunoproteasome ranging from 26% to 32% \nand 41% to 49%, respectively, at 20 mg/m2. Proteasome inhibition was maintained for ≥ 48 hours \nfollowing the first dose of carfilzomib for each week of dosing. Combination dosing with \nlenalidomide and dexamethasone did not affect proteasome inhibition. \n \nAt the higher dose of 56 mg/m2, there was not only a greater inhibition of CT-L subunits (≥ 90%) \ncompared to those at 15 to 20 mg/m2, but also a greater inhibition of other proteasome subunits \n(LMP7, MECL1, and LMP2). There was an approximately 8%, 23% and 34% increase in the \ninhibition of LMP7, MECL1, and LMP2 subunits respectively at the dose of 56 mg/m2 compared to \n\n\n\n18 \n\nthose at 15 to 20 mg/m2. Similar proteasome inhibition by carfilzomib was achieved with \n2 to 10 minute and 30 minute infusions at the 2 dose levels (20 and 36 mg/m2) at which it was tested. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nKyprolis in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with \nrelapsed multiple myeloma – study PX-171-009 (ASPIRE) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Kyprolis were evaluated in a randomised, open-label, multicentre study of \n792 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, which evaluated the combination of Kyprolis with \nlenalidomide and dexamethasone versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone, randomised 1:1. \n \nThis study evaluated Kyprolis at an initial dose of 20 mg/m2, which was increased to 27 mg/m2 on \ncycle 1, day 8, administered twice weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks as a 10 minute infusion. Kyprolis \ntreatment was administered for a maximum of 18 cycles unless discontinued early for disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity. Lenalidomide and dexamethasone administration could continue \nuntil progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n \nPatients who had the following were excluded from the study: creatinine clearance rates < 50 mL/min, \nNYHA Class III to IV congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within the last 4 months, \ndisease progression during the treatment with a bortezomib-containing regimen, or progression during \nthe first 3 months of initiating treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or progression at any \ntime during treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone if this was the subject’s most recent line \nof therapy. Study eligibility criteria allowed a small subset of patients with myeloma refractory to \nbortezomib (n = 118) or lenalidomide (n = 57) to be enrolled. Enrolled subjects were defined as \nrefractory to a therapy if they met any of the following 3 criteria: nonresponsive (< minimal response) \nto any regimen; progression during any regimen; or progression within 60 days of completion of any \nregimen. This study did not evaluate the benefit/risk ratio in the broader refractory population. \n \nThe disease status and other baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two arms, \nincluding age (64 years, range 31-91 years), gender (56% male), ECOG performance status (48% with \nperformance status 1), high risk genetic mutations, consisting of the genetic subtypes t(4;14), t(14;16), \nor deletion 17p in ≥ 60% of plasma cells (13%), unknown-risk genetic mutations, which included \nsubjects with results not collected or not analysed (47%), and baseline ISS stage III disease (20%). \nSubjects had received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy (median of 2), including prior treatment with \nbortezomib (66%), thalidomide (44%) and lenalidomide (20%). \n \nThe results of study PX-171-009 are summarised in table 6 and in figure 1 and figure 2. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nTable 6.

A total of \n929 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 prior lines of \ntherapy were enrolled and randomised (464 in the Kd arm; 465 in the Vd arm). \n \nThis study evaluated Kyprolis at an initial dose of 20 mg/m2, which was increased to 56 mg/m2 on \ncycle 1, day 8, administered twice weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks as a 30 minute infusion until \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity. \n \nPatients randomised to the Vd arm could receive bortezomib either by the intravenous (n = 108) or \nsubcutaneous (n = 357) route. Patients who had the following were excluded from the study: creatinine \nclearance rates < 15 mL/min, NYHA Class III to IV congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction \nwithin the last 4 months or those with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%.

Study PX-171-011 was an open-label randomised phase 3 study \n(N = 315; exposure to ≥ 3 prior therapies required). Patients enrolled to study PX-171-011 were more \nheavily pre-treated with lower organ and marrow function as compared to those enrolled in study \nPX-171-009. PX-171-011 evaluated Kyprolis monotherapy versus a control arm (corticosteroids and \ncyclophosphamide). The study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating superiority \nof Kyprolis monotherapy over the active control arm in overall survival (HR = 0.975 \n[95% CI: 0.760, 1.249]). PX-171-003A1 was a single-arm phase 2 study (N = 266; exposure to ≥ 2 \nprior therapies required), which met its primary efficacy endpoint of IRC-assessed ORR (22.9%). \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nAn evaluation of possible effects of carfilzomib on cardiac function was performed by analysing, via \ncentral blind reading, triplicate ECG in 154 subjects with advanced malignancies, including multiple \nmyeloma. The effect of carfilzomib on cardiac repolarisation using the QT interval with Fridericia’s \ncorrection (QTcF interval) and the analysis of concentration-QTc relationships show no clear signal of \nany dose-related effect. The upper bound of one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for predicted \neffect on QTcF at Cmax was 4.8 msec. With Bazett’s correction (QTcB interval), the upper bound of \none-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for predicted effect on QTcB at Cmax was 5.9 msec. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKyprolis in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe Cmax and AUC following a 2 to 10 minute intravenous infusion of 27 mg/m2 was 4,232 ng/mL and \n379 ng•hr/mL, respectively. Following repeated doses of Kyprolis at 15 and 20 mg/m2, systemic \nexposure (AUC) and half-life were similar on days 1 and 15 or 16 of cycle 1, suggesting there was no \nsystemic carfilzomib accumulation. At doses between 20 and 56 mg/m2, there was a dose-dependent \nincrease in exposure. \n \nA 30 minute infusion resulted in a similar half-life and AUC, but 2- to 3-fold lower Cmax compared to \nthat observed with a 2 to 10 minute infusion of the same dose. Following a 30 minute infusion of the \n56 mg/m2 dose, the AUC (948 ng•hr/mL) was approximately 2.5-fold that observed at the 27 mg/m2 \nlevel, and Cmax (2,079 ng/mL) was lower compared to that of 27 mg/m2 over the 2 to 10 minute \ninfusion. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean steady-state volume of distribution of a 20 mg/m2 dose of carfilzomib was 28 L. When \ntested in vitro, the binding of carfilzomib to human plasma proteins averaged 97% over the \nconcentration range of 0.4 to 4 micromolar. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nCarfilzomib was rapidly and extensively metabolised. The predominant metabolites measured in \nhuman plasma and urine, and generated in vitro by human hepatocytes, were peptide fragments and \nthe diol of carfilzomib, suggesting that peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis were the principal \npathways of metabolism. Cytochrome P450 mediated mechanisms played a minor role in overall \ncarfilzomib metabolism. The metabolites have no known biologic activity. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of doses ≥ 15 mg/m2, carfilzomib was rapidly cleared from the \nsystemic circulation with a half-life of ≤ 1 hour on day 1 of cycle 1. The systemic clearance ranged \nfrom 151 to 263 L/hour, and exceeded hepatic blood flow, suggesting that carfilzomib was largely \ncleared extrahepatically. Carfilzomib is eliminated primarily via metabolism with subsequent \nexcretion of its metabolites in urine. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate there are no effects of age, gender or race on the \npharmacokinetics of carfilzomib. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nA pharmacokinetic study evaluated 33 patients with relapsed or progressive advanced malignancies \n(solid tumours; n = 31 or haematologic malignancies; n = 2) who had normal hepatic function \n(bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN]; aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤ ULN, n = 10), mild \nhepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1-1.5 × ULN or AST > ULN, but bilirubin ≤ ULN, n = 14), or \nmoderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1.5-3 × ULN; any AST, n = 9). The pharmacokinetics of \ncarfilzomib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 × ULN and \nany AST). Kyprolis, as a single agent, was administered intravenously over 30 minutes at 20 mg/m2 on \ndays 1 and 2 and at 27 mg/m2 on days 8, 9, 15 and 16 of cycle 1. If tolerated, patients received \n56 mg/m2 starting in cycle 2. Baseline hepatic function status had no marked effect on the total \nsystemic exposure (AUClast) of carfilzomib following single or repeat-dose administration (geometric \nmean ratio in AUClast at the 27 mg/m2 dose in cycle 1, day 16 for mild and moderate impairment \nversus normal hepatic function were 144.4% and 126.1%, respectively; and at the 56 mg/m2 dose in \ncycle 2, day 1 were 144.7% and 121.1%). However, in patients with mild or moderate baseline hepatic \nimpairment, all of whom had solid tumours, there was a higher subject incidence of hepatic function \nabnormalities, ≥ grade 3 adverse events and serious adverse events compared with subjects with \nnormal hepatic function (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib was studied in two dedicated renal impairment studies. \n \nThe first study was conducted in 50 multiple myeloma patients with normal renal function \n(CrCL > 80 mL/min, n = 12), mild (CrCL 50-80 mL/min, n = 12), moderate (CrCL 30-49 mL/min, \nn = 10), and severe (CrCL < 30 mL/min, n = 8) renal impairment, and patients on chronic dialysis \n(n = 8). Kyprolis, as a single agent, was administered intravenously over 2 to 10 minutes at doses up to \n20 mg/m2. Pharmacokinetic data were collected from patients following the 15 mg/m2 dose in cycle 1 \nand the 20 mg/m2 dose in cycle 2. The second study was conducted in 23 relapsed multiple myeloma \npatients with creatinine clearance ≥ 75 mL/min (n = 13) and patients with end stage renal disease \n(ESRD) requiring dialysis (n = 10). Pharmacokinetic data were collected from patients following \nadministration of a 27 mg/m2 dose as a 30 minute infusion on cycle 1, day 16 and the 56 mg/m2 dose \non cycle 2, day 1. \n \nResults from both studies show that renal function status had no marked effect on the exposure of \ncarfilzomib following single or repeat-dose administration. The geometric mean ratio in AUClast at the \n\n\n\n26 \n\n15 mg/m2 dose cycle 1, day 1 for mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and chronic dialysis versus \nnormal renal function were 124.36%, 111.07%, 84.73% and 121.72%, respectively. The geometric \nmean ratios in AUClast at the 27 mg/m2 dose cycle 1, day 16 and at the 56 mg/m2 dose cycle 2, day 1 \nfor ESRD versus normal renal function were 139.72% and 132.75%, respectively. In the first study the \nM14 metabolite, a peptide fragment and the most abundant circulating metabolite, increased 2- and \n3-fold in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, and 7-fold in patients \nrequiring dialysis (based on AUClast). In the second study, the exposures for M14 were greater \n(approximately 4-fold) in subjects with ESRD than in subjects with normal renal function. This \nmetabolite has no known biological activities. Serious adverse events related to worsening renal \nfunction were more common in subjects with baseline renal dysfunction (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarfilzomib was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in peripheral blood \nlymphocytes. Carfilzomib was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test and \nwas not clastogenic in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nMonkeys administered a single bolus intravenous dose of carfilzomib at 3 mg/kg (which corresponds \nto 36 mg/m2 and is similar to the recommended dose in humans of 27 mg/m2 based on BSA) \nexperienced hypotension, increased heart rate, and increased serum levels of troponin T. The repeated \nbolus intravenous administration of carfilzomib at ≥ 2 mg/kg/dose in rats and 2 mg/kg/dose in \nmonkeys using dosing schedules similar to those used clinically resulted in mortalities that were due to \ntoxicities occurring in the cardiovascular (cardiac failure, cardiac fibrosis, pericardial fluid \naccumulation, cardiac haemorrhage/degeneration), gastrointestinal (necrosis/haemorrhage), renal \n(glomerulonephropathy, tubular necrosis, dysfunction), and pulmonary (haemorrhage/inflammation) \nsystems. The dose of 2 mg/kg/dose in rats is approximately half the recommended dose in humans of \n27 mg/m2 based on BSA. The highest non-severely toxic dose of 0.5 mg/kg in monkeys resulted in \ninterstitial inflammation in the kidney along with slight glomerulopathy and slight heart inflammation. \nThose findings were reported at 6 mg/m2 which are below the recommended dose in humans of \n27 mg/m2. \n \nFertility studies with carfilzomib have not been conducted. No effects on reproductive tissues were \nnoted during 28-day repeat-dose rat and monkey toxicity studies or in 6-month rat and 9-month \nmonkey chronic toxicity studies. Carfilzomib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rabbits at \ndoses that were lower than in patients receiving the recommended dose. Carfilzomib administered to \npregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day, \nwhich is approximately half the recommended dose in humans of 27 mg/m2 based on BSA. \n \n \n6.

The elapsed time from \nreconstitution to administration should not exceed 24 hours. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and should not be \nlonger than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nKyprolis 10 mg powder for solution for infusion \n10 mL type I clear glass vial, closed with fluoropolymer laminated elastomeric stopper and aluminium \nseal with a light blue plastic flip off cap. \n \nKyprolis 30 mg powder for solution for infusion \n30 mL type I clear glass vial, closed with fluoropolymer laminated elastomeric stopper and aluminium \nseal with an orange plastic flip off cap. \n \nKyprolis 60 mg powder for solution for infusion \n50 mL type I clear glass vial, closed with fluoropolymer laminated elastomeric stopper and aluminium \nseal with a purple plastic flip off cap. \n \nPack size of one vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nGeneral precautions \n \nCarfilzomib is a cytotoxic agent. Therefore, caution should be used during handling and preparation of \nKyprolis. Use of gloves and other protective equipment is recommended. \n \nReconstitution and preparation for intravenous administration \n \nKyprolis vials contain no antimicrobial preservatives and are intended for single use only. Proper \naseptic technique must be observed. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThe reconstituted solution contains carfilzomib at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Read the complete \npreparation instructions prior to reconstitution: \n \n1. Calculate the dose (mg/m2) and number of vials of Kyprolis required using the patient’s BSA at \n\nbaseline. Patients with a BSA greater than 2.2 m2 should receive a dose based upon a BSA of \n2.2 m2. Dose adjustments do not need to be made for weight changes of ≤ 20%. \n\n \n2. Remove vial from refrigerator just prior to use. \n \n3. Use only a 21-gauge or larger gauge needle (0.8 mm or smaller external diameter needle) to \n\naseptically reconstitute each vial by slowly injecting 5 mL (for 10 mg vial), 15 mL (for 30 mg \nvial) or 29 mL (for 60 mg vial) sterile water for injections through the stopper and directing the \nsolution onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL to minimise foaming. \n\n \n4. Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for approximately 1 minute, or until complete \n\ndissolution. DO NOT SHAKE. If foaming occurs, allow the solution to settle in the vial until \nfoaming subsides (approximately 5 minutes) and the solution is clear. \n\n \n5. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. The \n\nreconstituted product should be a clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution and should not be \nadministered if any discolouration or particulate matter is observed. \n\n \n6. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. \n \n7. Kyprolis can be administered directly by intravenous infusion or optionally administered in an \n\nintravenous bag. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \n8. When administering in an intravenous bag, use only a 21-gauge or larger gauge needle (0.8 mm \n\nor smaller external diameter needle) to withdraw the calculated dose from the vial and dilute \ninto a 50 or 100 mL intravenous bag containing 5% glucose solution for injection. \n\n \nDisposal \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Kyprolis is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Kyprolis \n3. How to use Kyprolis \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Kyprolis \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Kyprolis is and what it is used for \n \nKyprolis is a medicine that contains the active substance carfilzomib. \n \nCarfilzomib works by blocking the proteasome. The proteasome is a system within the cells that \nbreaks down proteins when they are damaged or no longer needed. By preventing the breakdown of \nproteins in cancer cells, which are more likely to contain more abnormal proteins, Kyprolis causes the \ndeath of cancer cells. \n \nKyprolis is used to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma who have had at least one previous \ntreatment for this disease. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells (a type of white blood cell). \n \nKyprolis will be given to you together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or only with \ndexamethasone. Lenalidomide and dexamethasone are other medicines used to treat multiple \nmyeloma. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Kyprolis \n \nYour doctor will examine you and review your full medical history. You will be monitored closely \nduring treatment. Before starting Kyprolis, and during treatment, you will undergo blood testing. This \nis to check that you have enough blood cells and your liver and kidneys are working properly. Your \ndoctor or nurse will check if you are getting enough fluids. \n \nYou must read the package leaflet of all medicines that you take in combination with Kyprolis so that \nyou understand the information related to those medicines. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nDo not use Kyprolis if you are allergic to carfilzomib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using Kyprolis if you have any of the conditions listed below. \nYou may need extra tests to check that your heart, kidneys and liver are working properly. \n \n Heart problems, including a history of chest pain (angina), heart attack, irregular heartbeat, high \n\nblood pressure or if you have ever taken a medicine for your heart \n Lung problems, including a history of shortness of breath at rest or with activity (dyspnoea) \n Kidney problems, including kidney failure or if you have ever received dialysis \n Liver problems, including a history of hepatitis, fatty liver, or if you have ever been told your \n\nliver is not working properly \n Unusual bleeding, including easy bruising, bleeding from an injury, such as a cut, that takes \n\nlonger than expected to stop, or internal bleeding such as coughing up blood, vomiting up \nblood, dark tarry stools, or bright red blood in your stools; or bleeding in the brain leading to \nsudden numbness or paralysis on one side of the face, legs or arms, sudden severe headache or \ntrouble seeing or difficulty speaking or swallowing. This can indicate you have low numbers of \nplatelets (cells that help the blood to clot) \n\n A history of blood clots in your veins \n Leg or arm pain or swelling (which could be a symptom of blood clots in the deep veins of the \n\nleg or arm), chest pain or shortness of breath (which may be a symptom of blood clots in the \nlungs) \n\n Any other major disease for which you were hospitalised or received any medicine. \n \nConditions you need to look out for \n \nYou must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking Kyprolis to reduce the risk of any \nproblems. Kyprolis can make some conditions worse or cause serious side effects, which may be fatal, \nsuch as heart problems, lung problems, kidney problems, tumour lysis syndrome (a life-threatening \ncondition that occurs when cancer cells break and release their content to the bloodstream), reactions \nto the Kyprolis infusion, unusual bruising or bleeding, (including internal bleeding), blood clots in \nyour veins, liver problems, certain blood conditions, or a neurological condition known as PRES. See \n‘Conditions you need to look out for’ in section 4. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because this \nmedicine could cause hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will check you for signs of \nthis infection before, during and for some time after treatment with this medicine. Tell your doctor \nright away if you get worsening tiredness, or yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes. \n \nAt any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you: experience \nblurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way \nyou walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of \nsensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal \nbrain condition known as Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these \nsymptoms prior to treatment with carfilzomib, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. \n \nOther medicines and Kyprolis \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This \nincludes any medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins or herbal remedies. \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking medicines used to prevent pregnancy such as oral \ncontraceptives or other hormonal contraceptives, as these may not be suitable for use with Kyprolis. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nFor women taking Kyprolis \n \nDo not take Kyprolis if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. \nTreatment with Kyprolis has not been evaluated in pregnant women. While taking Kyprolis, and for \n30 days after stopping treatment you should use a suitable method of contraception to ensure you do \nnot become pregnant. You should talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception. \n \nIf you become pregnant while taking Kyprolis, notify your doctor or nurse immediately. \n \nDo not take Kyprolis if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if Kyprolis passes into breast milk in \nhumans. \n \nLenalidomide is expected to be harmful to the unborn child. As Kyprolis is given in combination with \nlenalidomide, you must follow the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (see package leaflet for \nlenalidomide for information on pregnancy prevention and discuss with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse). \n \nFor men taking Kyprolis \n \nWhile taking Kyprolis and for 90 days after stopping treatment, you should use a condom even if your \npartner is pregnant. \n \nIf your partner becomes pregnant whilst you are taking Kyprolis or within 90 days after stopping \ntreatment, notify your doctor or nurse immediately. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nWhile you are being treated with Kyprolis you may experience fatigue, dizziness, fainting, and/or a \ndrop in blood pressure. This may impair your ability to drive or operate machines. Do not drive a car \nor operate machines if you have these symptoms. \n \nKyprolis contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains 37 mg sodium per 10 mg vial. This is equivalent to 1.9% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nThis medicine contains 109 mg sodium per 30 mg vial. This is equivalent to 5.5% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nThis medicine contains 216 mg sodium per 60 mg vial. This is equivalent to 11% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nKyprolis contains cyclodextrin \n \nThis medicine contains 500 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 10 mg vial. This is \nequivalent to 88 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. \n \nThis medicine contains 1,500 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 30 mg vial. This \nis equivalent to 88 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. \n \nThis medicine contains 3,000 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 60 mg vial. This \nis equivalent to 88 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. \n \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n3. How to use Kyprolis \n \nKyprolis will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. The dose will be calculated based on your height \nand weight (body surface area). Your doctor or nurse will determine the dose of Kyprolis that you \nreceive. \n \nKyprolis will be given as an infusion into a vein. The infusion may last up to 30 minutes. Kyprolis is \ngiven 2 days in a row each week, for 3 weeks, followed by one week without treatment. \n \nEach 28-day period is one treatment cycle. This means that Kyprolis will be given to you on days 1, 2, \n8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle. The doses on day 8 and 9 of each cycle will not be given from \ncycle 13 onwards if you are treated with Kyprolis in combination with lenalidomide and \ndexamethasone. \n \nMost patients will receive treatment for as long as their disease improves or remains stable. However, \nKyprolis treatment may also be stopped if you experience side effects that cannot be managed. \n \nTogether with Kyprolis you will also be given either lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or only \ndexamethasone. You may also be given other medicines. \n \nIf you are given too much Kyprolis \n \nAs this medicine is being given by a doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. \nHowever, if you are given too much Kyprolis your doctor will monitor you for side effects. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Therefore, caution should be used during handling and preparation of \nKyprolis. Use of gloves and other protective equipment is recommended. \n \nKyprolis vials contain no antimicrobial preservatives and are intended for single use only. Proper \naseptic technique must be observed. \n \nThe reconstituted solution contains carfilzomib at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Read the complete \npreparation instructions prior to reconstitution: \n \n1. Calculate the dose (mg/m2) and number of vials of Kyprolis required using the patient’s BSA at \n\nbaseline. Patients with a BSA greater than 2.2 m2 should receive a dose based upon a BSA of \n2.2 m2. Dose adjustments do not need to be made for weight changes of ≤ 20%. \n\n \n2. Remove vial from refrigerator just prior to use. \n \n3. Use only a 21-gauge or larger gauge needle (0.8 mm or smaller external diameter needle) to \n\naseptically reconstitute each vial by slowly injecting 5 mL (for 10 mg vial), 15 mL (for 30 mg \nvial) or 29 mL (for 60 mg vial) sterile water for injections through the stopper and directing the \nsolution onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL to minimise foaming. \n\n \n4. Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for approximately 1 minute, or until complete \n\ndissolution. DO NOT SHAKE. If foaming occurs, allow the solution to settle in the vial until \nfoaming subsides (approximately 5 minutes) and the solution is clear. \n\n \n5. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. The \n\nreconstituted product should be a clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution and should not be \nadministered if any discolouration or particulate matter is observed. \n\n \n6. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. \n \n7. Kyprolis can be administered directly by intravenous infusion or optionally administered in an \n\nintravenous bag. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \n8. When administering in an intravenous bag, use only a 21-gauge or larger gauge needle (0.8 mm \n\nor smaller external diameter needle) to withdraw the calculated dose from the vial and dilute \ninto a 50 or 100 mL intravenous bag containing 5% glucose solution for injection. \n\n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and should not be \nlonger than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
