NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nALISADE 27.5 micrograms/spray  \nnasal spray suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach spray actuation delivers 27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nNasal spray, suspension. \n \nWhite suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAdults, adolescents (12 years and over) and children (6 \u2013 11 years)  \n \nAlisade is indicated for the treatment of: \n\u2022 the symptoms of allergic rhinitis \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFluticasone furoate nasal spray is for administration by the intranasal route only.  \n \nFor full therapeutic benefit regular, scheduled usage is recommended. Onset of action has been \nobserved as early as 8 hours after initial administration. However, it may take several days of \ntreatment to achieve maximum benefit, and the patient should be informed that their symptoms will \nimprove with continuous regular use (see section 5.1). The duration of treatment should be restricted \nto the period that corresponds to allergenic exposure. \n \nAdults and Adolescents (12 years and over) \nThe recommended starting dose is two spray actuations (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per \nspray actuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 110 micrograms).  \n \nOnce adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril \n(total daily dose 55 micrograms) may be effective for maintenance. \n The dose should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. \n \nChildren (6 to 11 years of age) \nThe recommended starting dose is one spray actuation (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per \nspray actuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms).  \n \nPatients not adequately responding to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, \n55 micrograms) may use two spray actuations in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, \n110 micrograms). Once adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray \nactuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms) is recommended. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n\nChildren under 6 years of age: The experience in children under the age of 6 years is limited (see \nsection 5.1 and 5.2). Safety and efficacy in this group has not been well established. \n \nElderly Patients: No dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal Impaired Patients: No dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic Impaired Patients: No dose adjustment is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nThe intranasal device should be shaken before use. The device is primed by pressing the mist release \nbutton for at least six spray actuations (until a fine mist is seen), whilst holding the device upright. Re-\npriming (approximately 6 sprays until a fine mist is seen) is only necessary if the cap is left off for 5 \ndays or the intranasal device has not been used for 30 days or more. \nThe device should be cleaned after each use and the cap replaced. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Alisade. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, therefore the systemic exposure of \nintranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with severe liver disease is likely to be increased. This may \nresult in a higher frequency of systemic adverse events (see section 4.2 and 5.2). Caution is advised \nwhen treating these patients. \n \nRitonavir \nConcomitant administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased \nsystemic exposure of fluticasone furoate (see section 4.5). \n \nSystemic effects of nasal corticosteroid may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged \nperiods. These effects vary between patients and different corticosteroids (see section 5.2). \n \nTreatment with higher than recommended doses of nasal corticosteroids may result in clinically \nsignificant adrenal suppression. If there is evidence for higher than recommended doses being used, \nthen additional systemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress or elective \nsurgery.  Fluticasone furoate 110 micrograms once daily was not associated with hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression in adult, adolescent or paediatric subjects. However the dose \nof intranasal fluticasone furoate should be reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of the \nsymptoms of rhinitis is maintained. As with all intranasal corticosteroids, the total systemic burden of \ncorticosteroids should be considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed \nconcurrently. \n \nGrowth retardation has been reported in children receiving some nasal corticosteroids at licensed \ndoses. It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with nasal \ncorticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of \nreducing the dose of nasal corticosteroid if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of \nsymptoms is maintained. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a \npaediatric specialist (see section 5.1). \n \nIf there is any reason to believe that adrenal function is impaired, care must be taken when transferring \npatients from systemic steroid treatment to fluticasone furoate. \n \nNasal and inhaled corticosteriods may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. \nTherefore close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history if \nincreased pressure, glaucoma and/or cataracts. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n\n \nAlisade contains benzalkonium chloride. It may cause irritation of the nasal mucosa. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by the cytochrome \nP450 3A4.  \n \nBased on data with another glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), that is metabolised by CYP3A4, \nco-administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic \nexposure of fluticasone furoate. \n \nCaution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors as \nan increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out. In a drug interaction study of intranasal \nfluticasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole there were more subjects with \nmeasurable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the ketoconazole group (6 of the 20 subjects) \ncompared to placebo (1 out of 20 subjects). This small increase in exposure did not result in a \nstatistically significant difference in 24 hour serum cortisol levels between the two groups (see section \n4.4). \n \nThe enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that there is no theoretical basis for anticipating \nmetabolic interactions between fluticasone furoate and the cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of \nother compounds at clinically relevant intranasal doses. Therefore, no clinical studies have been \nconducted to investigate interactions of fluticasone furoate on other drugs. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of fluticasone furoate in pregnant women. In animal studies \nglucocorticoids have been shown to induce malformations including cleft palate and intra-uterine \ngrowth retardation. This is not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended nasal doses which \nresults in minimal systemic exposure (see section 5.2). Fluticasone furoate should be used in \npregnancy only if the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the foetus or child. \n \nIt is unknown whether nasal administered fluticasone furoate is excreted in human breast milk. \nAdministration of fluticasone furoate to women who are breastfeeding should only be considered if the \nexpected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed as fluticasone \nfuroate is not expected to affect this ability. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nData from large clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions.  \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of frequencies: Very common >1/10; \nCommon >1/100 to <1/10; Uncommon >1/1000 to <1/100; Rare >1/10,000 to <1/1000; Very rare \n<1/10,000. \n \n\nImmune system disorders \nRare Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and \n\nurticaria. \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery common *Epistaxis \nCommon Nasal ulceration \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n5 \n\n \n \n*Epistaxis was generally mild to moderate in intensity. In adults and adolescents, the incidence of \nepistaxis was higher in longer-term use (more than 6 weeks) than in short-term use (up to 6 weeks).  In \npaediatric clinical studies of up to 12 weeks duration the incidence of epistaxis was similar between \npatients receiving fluticasone furoate and patients receiving placebo. \n \nSystemic effects of nasal corticosteroids may occur, particularly when prescribed at high doses for \nprolonged periods. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn a bioavailability study, intranasal doses of up to 2640 micrograms per day were administered over \nthree days with no adverse systemic effects observed (see section 5.2). \nAcute overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids. ATC code: R01AD12 \n \nFluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid that possesses a very high affinity for the \nglucocorticoid receptor and has a potent anti-inflammatory action. \n \nClinical experience: \nSeasonal Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents \nCompared with placebo, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly \nimproved nasal symptoms (comprising rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, sneezing and nasal itching) and \nocular symptoms (comprising itching/burning, tearing/watering and redness of the eyes) in all 4 \nstudies. Efficacy was maintained over the full 24-hours dosing period with once daily administration. \n \nOnset of therapeutic benefit was observed as early as 8 hours after initial administration, with further \nimprovement observed for several days afterwards.   \nFluticasone furoate nasal spray significantly improved the patients\u2019 perception of overall response to \ntherapy, and the patients\u2019 disease-related quality of life (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life \nQuestionnaire \u2013 RQLQ), in all 4 studies. \n \nPerennial Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents: \nFluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms as \nwell as patients\u2019 perception of overall response to therapy compared to placebo in three studies.  \nFluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved ocular symptoms as \nwell as improving patients\u2019 disease-related quality of life (RQLQ) compared to placebo in one study. \nEfficacy was maintained over the full 24-hour dosing period with once daily administration.  \n \nSeasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children: \nThe paediatric posology is based on assessment of the efficacy data across the allergic rhinitis \npopulation in children. \nIn seasonal allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily was effective \nbut no significant differences were observed between fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms \nonce daily and placebo on any endpoint. \nIn perennial allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily exhibited a \nmore consistent efficacy profile than fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily over 4 \nweeks\u2019 treatment. Post-hoc analysis over 6 and 12 weeks in the same study, as well as 6-week HPA \naxis safety study, supported the efficacy of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n6 \n\nA 6-week study that assessed the effect of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily \non adrenal function in children aged 2 to 11 years showed that there was no significant effect on 24-\nhour serum cortisol profiles, compared with placebo. \nResults from a placebo-controlled knemometry study of fluticasone furoate nasal spray \n110 micrograms once daily revealed no clinically relevant effects on short-term lower leg growth rate \nin children (6 to 11 years). \n \nSeasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children (under 6 years): \nSafety and efficacy studies were performed in a total of 271 patients from 2 to 5 years of age in both \nseasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, of whom 176 were exposed to fluticasone furoate. \n Safety and efficacy in this group has not been well established. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption: Fluticasone furoate undergoes incomplete absorption and extensive first-pass metabolism \nin the liver and gut resulting in negligible systemic exposure. The intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms \nonce daily does not typically result in measurable plasma concentrations (<10 pg/ml). The absolute \nbioavailability for intranasal fluticasone furoate is 0.50 %, such that less than 1 microgram of \nfluticasone furoate would be systemically available after administration of 110 micrograms (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nDistribution: The plasma protein binding of fluticasone furoate is greater than 99 %. Fluticasone \nfuroate is widely distributed with volume of distribution at steady-state of, on average, 608 l.  \n \nMetabolism: Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared (total plasma clearance of 58.7 l/h) from systemic \ncirculation principally by hepatic metabolism to an inactive 17\u03b2-carboxylic metabolite (GW694301X), \nby the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. The principal route of metabolism was hydrolysis of the S-\nfluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid metabolite. In vivo studies have \nrevealed no evidence of cleavage of the furoate moiety to form fluticasone. \n \nElimination: Elimination was primarily via the faecal route following oral and intravenous \nadministration indicative of excretion of fluticasone furoate and its metabolites via the bile. Following \nintravenous administration, the elimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hours. Urinary excretion \naccounted for approximately 1 % and 2 % of the orally and intravenously administered dose, \nrespectively. \n \nChildren:  \nIn the majority of patients fluticasone furoate is not quantifiable (< 10 pg/ml) following intranasal \ndosing of 110 micrograms once daily. Quantifiable levels were observed in 15.1 % of paediatric \npatients following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily and only 6.8 % of paediatric \npatients following 55 micrograms once daily.  There was no evidence for higher quantifiable levels of \nfluticasone furoate in younger children (less than 6 years of age). Median fluticasone furoate \nconcentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels at 55 micrograms were 18.4 pg/ml and \n18.9 pg/ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively. At 110 micrograms, median concentrations in those \nsubjects with quantifiable levels were 14.3 pg/ml and 14.4 pg/ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively. \nThe values are similar to those seen in adults (12+) where median concentrations in those subjects \nwith quantifiable levels were 15.4 pg/ml and 21.8 pg/ml at 55 micrograms and 110 micrograms, \nrespectively. \n \nElderly: \nOnly a small number of elderly patients (\u2265 65 years, n=23/872; 2.6 %) provided pharmacokinetic data. \nThere was no evidence for a higher incidence of patients with quantifiable fluticasone furoate \nconcentrations in the elderly, when compared with the younger patients. \n \nRenal Impairment:  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n7 \n\nFluticasone furoate is not detectable in urine from healthy volunteers after intranasal dosing. Less than \n1 % of dose-related material is excreted in urine and therefore renal impairment would not be expected \nto affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate. \n \nHepatic Impairment:  \nThere are no data with intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with hepatic impairment. A study of a \nsingle 400 microgram dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment resulted in increased Cmax (42 %) and AUC(0-\u221e) (172 %) and a modest (on average \n23 %) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects. From this study the average \npredicted exposure of 110 micrograms of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate \nhepatic impairment would not be expected to result in suppression of cortisol. Therefore moderate \nhepatic impairment is not predicted to result in a clinically relevant effect for the normal adult dose. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The exposure of fluticasone furoate is \nlikely to be further increased in such patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nFindings in general toxicology studies were similar to those observed with other glucocorticoids and \nare associated with exaggerated pharmacological activity. These findings are not likely to be relevant \nfor humans given recommended nasal doses which results in minimal systemic exposure. No \ngenotoxic effects of fluticasone furoate have been observed in conventional genotoxicity tests. Further, \nthere were no treatment-related increases in the incidence of tumours in two year inhalation studies in \nrats and mice. \n \n \n6.

It will contain \neither 30, 60 or 120 sprays, depending on the pack size that has been prescribed for you. \n \n\n \n \nThe window in the plastic casing lets you see how much Alisade is left in the bottle. You will be able \nto see the liquid level for a new 30 or 60 spray bottle, but not in a new 120 spray bottle because the \nliquid level is above the window.  \n\nSix important things you need to know about using the nasal spray \n\n\u2022 Alisade comes in a brown bottle. If you need to check how much is left hold the nasal spray \nupright against a bright light. You will then be able to see the level through the window.   \n\n\u2022 When you first use the nasal spray you will need to shake it vigorously with the cap on for \nabout 10 seconds. This is important as Alisade is a thick suspension that becomes liquid when \nyou shake it well - see picture b. It will only spray when it becomes liquid. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n25 \n\n\u2022 The mist-release button must be pressed firmly all the way in, to release the mist through the \nnozzle - see picture c.  \n\n \n\n \n\u2022 If you have difficulty pressing the button with your thumb, you can use two hands \u2013 see picture \n\nd \n \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 Always keep the cap on the nasal spray when you are not using it. The cap keeps the dust out, \nseals in the pressure and stops the nozzle from blocking up. When the cap is in place the mist-\nrelease button cannot be pressed accidentally. \n\n\u2022 Never use a pin or anything sharp to clear the nozzle. It will damage the nasal spray. \n\n \n\nPreparing the nasal spray for use \n \nYou must prepare the nasal spray: \n \n\u2022 before you use it for the first time \n\n\u2022 if you have left the cap off \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n26 \n\nPreparing the nasal spray helps to make sure you always get the full dose of medicine. Follow these \nsteps: \n\n1 Shake the nasal spray vigorously with the cap on for about 10 seconds.   \n\n2 Remove the cap by squeezing firmly on the sides of the cap with your thumb and forefinger\u2013 \nsee picture e.  \n\n \n \n3 Hold the nasal spray upright, then tilt and point the nozzle away from you.  \n\n4 Press the button firmly all the way in. Do this at least 6 times until it releases a fine mist of \nspray into the air  \u2013 see picture f. \n\n \n \nThe nasal spray is now ready for use. \n\n \nUsing the nasal spray \n\n1 Shake the nasal spray vigorously.  \n\n2 Remove the cap.  \n\n3 Blow your nose to clear your nostrils, then tilt your head forward a little bit. \n\n4 Place the nozzle in one of your nostrils \u2013 see picture g.  Point the end of the nozzle slightly \noutwards, away from the centre ridge of your nose. This helps to get the medicine to the correct part of \nyour nose. \n\n5 Press the button firmly all the way in, while you breathe in through your nose \u2013 see picture \nh.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n27 \n\n \n6 Take the nozzle out and breathe out through your mouth. \n\n7 If your dose is two sprays in each nostril repeat steps 4 to 6. \n\n8 Repeat steps 4 to 7 to treat the other nostril. \n\n9 Replace the cap on the nasal spray. \n\n \nCleaning the nasal spray \n\nAfter each use: \n\n1 Wipe the nozzle and inside of the cap with a clean, dry tissue \u2013 see pictures i and j.  \n\n \n2 Do not use water to clean it.  \n\n3 Never use a pin or anything sharp on the nozzle.  \n\n4 Always replace the cap once you have finished. \n\n If the nasal spray does not seem to be working: \n\n\u2022 Check you still have medicine left. Look at the level through the window. If the level is very \nlow there may not be enough left to work the nasal spray. \n\n\u2022 Check the nasal spray for damage  \n\n\u2022 If you think the nozzle may be blocked, do not use a pin or anything sharp to clear it.  \n\n\u2022 Try to reset it by following the instructions under \u2018Preparing the nasal spray for use\u2019.  \n\nIf it is still not working, or if it produces a jet of liquid, take the nasal spray back to the \npharmacy to get advice. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
