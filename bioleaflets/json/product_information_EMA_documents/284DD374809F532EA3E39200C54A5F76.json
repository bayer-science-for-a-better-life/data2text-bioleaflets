PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSuspension for injection. \n\nColourless and opalescent suspension. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of influenza in individuals 60 years of age and over, especially in those who run an \n\nincreased risk of associated complications. \n\n \n\nThe use of INTANZA should be based on official recommendations. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nIndividuals 60 years of age and over: 0.1 ml. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nINTANZA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to insufficient \n\ndata on safety and efficacy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \n\nImmunisation should be carried out by intradermal route. \n\nThe recommended site of administration is the region of the deltoid. \n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n\nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to any \n\nresidues such as eggs (ovalbumin, chicken proteins), neomycin, formaldehyde and octoxinol 9.  \n\n \n\nImmunisation shall be postponed in subjects with febrile illness or acute infection. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \n\nreadily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nINTANZA should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n\n \n\nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n\n \n\nVery limited data in immunocompromised patients are available for INTANZA. \n\n \n\nIn case of presence of liquid at the injection site after vaccine administration, re-vaccination is not \n\nrequired. \n\n \n\nInterference with serological testing: See section 4.5. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nINTANZA may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Immunisation should be carried out on \n\nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n\n \n\nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to \n\ndetect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed. The Western \n\nBlot technique disproves the false-positive ELISA test results. The transient false positive reactions \n\ncould be due to the IgM response by the vaccine. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nThis vaccine is intended for individuals 60 years of age and over. Therefore, this information is not \n\napplicable. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nINTANZA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\na. Summary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety of INTANZA has been assessed in 3 open-label randomised clinical trials, 3,372 vaccinees \n\nreceived an injection of INTANZA. \n\n \n\nSafety evaluation was performed for all subjects during the first 3 weeks following vaccination and \n\nserious adverse reactions were collected during six months of follow-up for 2,974 subjects \n\n(population of two out of the three clinical trials). \n\n \n\nThe most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were local reactions at injection \n\nsite. \n\nApparent local reactions after intradermal administration were more frequent than after intramuscular \n\nadministration of an adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine. \n\nMost reactions resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days after onset. \n\n \n\nSystemic safety profile of INTANZA is similar to the comparator vaccine, adjuvanted or non-\n\nadjuvanted, administered intramuscularly. \n\n \n\nAfter repetitive yearly injections the safety profile of INTANZA is similar to the previous injections. \n\n \n\nb. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe data below summarizes the frequencies of the adverse reactions that were recorded following \n\nvaccination during clinical trials and worldwide post-marketing experience, using the following \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nOrgan class Very \n\ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \n\nrare \n\nNot known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n     Allergic \n\nreactions \n\nincluding \n\ngeneralized \n\nskin reactions \n\nsuch as \n\nurticaria, \n\nanaphylactic \n\nreactions, \n\nangioedema, \n\nshock \n\n \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nHeadache   Paresthesia, \n\nneuritis \n\n \n\n  \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n  Sweating Pruritus, \n\nrash \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \n\nand connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\nMyalgia  Arthralgia    \n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions \n\nLocal \n\nreactions: \n\nredness*, \n\ninduration \n\nswelling, \n\npruritus, \n\npain \n\n \n\nMalaise, \n\nshivering, \n\nfever, \n\n \n\nLocal \n\nreactions: \n\necchymosis \n\nFatigue    \n\n*In some cases, local redness lasted up to 7 days. \n\n \n\nc.

The vaccine was \n\nimmunogenic in mice and rabbits. In repeated-dose toxicity studies in rabbits there was no significant \n\nevidence of systemic toxicity. Nevertheless, single and repeated administrations led to transient local \n\nerythema and oedema. Genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential were not assessed because these \n\nstudies are not appropriate for a vaccine. Fertility and toxicity studies to reproduction in females have \n\nnot identified any specific potential hazard for humans. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This vaccine is recommended to help to protect you against flu. \n\nThe vaccine may be administered to individuals of 60 years of age and over, especially in those who \n\nrun an increased risk of associated complications. \n\n \n\nWhen an injection of INTANZA is given, the immune system (body's natural defences) will develop \n\nprotection against flu infection. \n\nINTANZA will help to protect you against the three strains of virus contained in the vaccine, or other \n\nstrains closely related to them. Full effect of the vaccine is generally achieved 2-3 weeks after the \n\nvaccination. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use INTANZA \n\n \n\nDo not use INTANZA: \n\n- If you are allergic to: \n\n The active substances, \n\n Any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6), \n\n Any component that may be present in very small amounts such as eggs (ovalbumin, \n\nchicken proteins), neomycin, formaldehyde and octoxinol 9. \n\n- If you have an illness with fever or acute infection, the vaccination shall be postponed until \n\nafter you have recovered. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using INTANZA. \n\n \n\n- You should tell your doctor before vaccination if you have a poor immune response \n\n(immunosuppression) due to disease or medicines, because the vaccine may not work very well \n\nin this case. \n\n \n\n- This vaccine should under no circumstances be administered into a vein (intravascularly). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n- If, for any reason, you have a blood test within a few days following an influenza vaccination, \n\nplease tell your doctor. Tests for HIV-1, hepatitis C virus and HTLV-1 may be affected. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nINTANZA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther vaccines or medicines and INTANZA \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\n- Other vaccines: INTANZA can be given at the same time as other vaccines by using separate \n\nlimbs. It should be noted that the side effects may be intensified. \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have been treated with medicines that may reduce your immune \n\nresponse such as corticosteroids (for example cortisone), medicines against cancer \n\n(chemotherapy), radiotherapy or other medicines affecting the immune system. In this case, the \n\nvaccine may not work very well. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nThis vaccine is intended for individuals 60 years of age and over. Therefore, this information is not \n\napplicable. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis vaccine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use INTANZA  \n\n \n\nAlways use this vaccine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 0.1 ml for individuals 60 years of age and over. \n\n \n\nINTANZA is administered to you by your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nINTANZA is given as an injection into the upper layer of the skin (preferably the muscle of the upper \n\narm). \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
