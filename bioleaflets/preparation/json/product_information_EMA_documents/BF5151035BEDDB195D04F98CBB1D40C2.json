This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZynquista 200 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 200 mg sotagliflozin. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nOval, blue, film-coated tablet printed with “2456” on one side in black ink (tablet length: 14.2 mm, \ntablet width: 8.7 mm). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZynquista is indicated as an adjunct to insulin therapy to improve glycaemic control in adults with \ntype 1 diabetes mellitus with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m2, who have failed to achieve \nadequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy. \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy with Zynquista should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of type 1 diabetes mellitus. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 200 mg sotagliflozin once daily before the first meal of the day. After at \nleast three months, if additional glycaemic control is needed, in patients tolerating sotagliflozin \n200 mg, the dose may be increased to 400 mg once daily. \n \nBefore initiating treatment with sotagliflozin 200 mg and before increasing dose to sotagliflozin 400 \nmg: \n \n\n- Risk factors for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) should be assessed and ketone levels should be \nevaluated as normal. If ketones are elevated (blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) reading is \ngreater than 0.6 mmol/L or urine ketones one plus (+)) treatment with sotagliflozin should not \nbe initiated nor the dose should be increased to sotagliflozin 400 mg until the ketone levels are \nnormal (see sections 4.4). \n\n- It is recommended that patients obtain several baseline blood or urine ketone levels over one \nto two weeks prior to initiation of sotagliflozin therapy, and, patients should become familiar \nwith how their behaviours and circumstances affect their ketone levels. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n- Patients must be able to perform self-management of the day-to-day aspects of their disease \nincluding self-monitoring of glucose and ketones.  \n\n- Patients should be informed, in a dedicated education session, on the risk of DKA, how to \nrecognize DKA risk factors, signs or symptoms, how and when to monitor ketone levels and \nwhat actions to take when ketone levels are elevated (see section 4.4). \n\n- Correction of volume depletion prior to initiation of sotagliflozin is recommended in patients \nwith this condition (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSotagliflozin must only be administered as an adjunct to insulin. In order to avoid hypoglycaemia with \nthe first dose of sotagliflozin a 20% reduction in the first mealtime bolus insulin may be considered.  \nSubsequent bolus doses should be adjusted individually based on blood glucose results. No reduction \nin basal insulin is recommended when initiating sotagliflozin. Subsequently, basal insulin should be \nadjusted based on blood glucose results. When needed, insulin dose reduction should be done \ncautiously to avoid ketosis and DKA. \n \nKetone monitoring during treatment: \nDuring the initial one to two weeks of treatment with sotagliflozin, ketones should be monitored on a \nregular basis. After starting therapy, the frequency of ketone level testing (either blood or urine) \nshould be individualized, according to the patient's lifestyle and/or risk factors (see section 4.4). \nPatients should be informed about what actions to take if ketone levels are elevated. The \nrecommended actions are listed in Table 1. Measurement of blood ketone levels is preferred over \nurine. \n \nTable 1: Actions to take in case of elevated ketone levels  \nClinical \nstage \n\nBlood Ketone (beta-\nhydroxybutyrate) \n\nUrine Ketone  Actions  \n\nKetonaemia \nor Ketonuria \n\n0.6-1.5 mmol/L  \n  \n\nTrace or Small  \n+  \n  \n\nThe patient may need to take \nextra rapid-acting insulin and \ndrink water. Extra carbohydrates \nshould be taken if the glucose \nlevels are normal or low.  \n \nKetone levels should be \nmeasured again after two hours. \nCheck glucose levels frequently \nto avoid hyperglycaemia or \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nThe patient should immediately \nseek medical advice and stop \ntaking sotagliflozin if levels \npersist and symptoms present.  \n\nImpending \nDKA \n\n> 1.5-3.0 mmol/L  \n  \n\nModerate  \n++  \n  \n\nThe patient should immediately \nseek medical advice and stop \ntaking sotagliflozin. \n  \nThe patient may need to take \nextra rapid acting insulin and \ndrink water. Extra carbohydrates \nshould be taken if the glucose \nlevels are normal or low.  \n \nKetone levels should be \nmeasured again after two hours.  \nCheck glucose levels frequently \nto avoid hyperglycaemia or \n\n\n\n4 \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\nProbable \nDKA \n\n> 3.0 mmol/L  \n  \n\nLarge to very large  \n+++ / ++++  \n  \n\nThe patient should go to \nemergency department without \ndelay and stop taking \nsotagliflozin. \n \nThe patient may need to take \nextra rapid-acting insulin and \ndrink water. Extra carbohydrates \nshould be taken if the glucose \nlevels are normal or low. \n  \n\n  \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers the missed dose. A double \ndose should not be taken on the same day. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dosage adjustment is recommended based on age.  \nIn patients 65 years and older, renal function and an increased risk for volume depletion should be \ntaken into account (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Due to the limited therapeutic experience in patients \naged 75 years and older, initiation of sotagliflozin therapy is not recommended.  \n \nRenal impairment \nAssessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of sotagliflozin and periodically \nthereafter (see section 4.4). \n \nInitiation of sotagliflozin is not recommended when eGFR is less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and should \nbe discontinued if eGFR is persistently less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nSotagliflozin should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment, end stage renal disease \n(ESRD) or in patients on dialysis as it has not been studied in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment.  Sotagliflozin is not \nrecommended in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of sotagliflozin in children and adolescents has not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. \nSotagliflozin should be taken once daily before the first meal of the day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDiabetic ketoacidosis \n \nSodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with \nincreased risk of DKA. In the clinical trials (pool of two 52-week placebo-controlled trials) of \nsotagliflozin, the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was higher in the sotagliflozin treatment \ngroup compared with the placebo group (see section 4.8). \n \nBefore initiating sotagliflozin \nBefore starting treatment, patients should be evaluated with respect to DKA risk.  \nSotagliflozin should not be initiated when patients are at a higher risk of DKA, such as: \n- Patients with low insulin needs. \n- Patient not on optimal insulin dose or who have recent issues with noncompliance or recurrent \n\nerrors with insulin dosing and who are unlikely to maintain adequate insulin dosing. \n- Patients with recent or recurrent history of DKA (e.g.1 episode in the past 3 months or more than \n\n1 episode in the past 6 months).  \n- Patients with increased insulin requirements due to acute medical illness or surgery.  \n- Patients with elevated ketones levels (BHB reading is greater than 0.6 mmol/L or urine ketones \n\none plus (+)). If ketones are elevated (BHB reading is greater than 0.6 mmol/L), treatment with \nsotagliflozin should not be started until the ketone levels are normal (see section 4.2). \n\n- Patients unable or unwilling to monitor ketones. \n- Patients who insist on maintaining caloric restriction, carbohydrate restriction or ketogenic diet or \n\nwho chronically under-dose insulin (e.g. in order to remain in a lipolytic state).  \n- Patients with excessive alcohol consumption or who use illicit drugs. \n \nPatients using an insulin infusion pump have a higher risk of DKA and should be experienced with \npump use, common trouble-shooting strategies when interruptions of insulin delivery via pump occur \n(issues with insertion site, clogged tubing, empty reservoir, etc.) and use of supplemental insulin \ninjections with pen or syringe as needed in case of pump failure.  Patients should consider monitoring \nketones levels three to four hours after changing pump materials. Patients using a pump should also \ncheck their ketone levels with any suspected insulin interruption, regardless of blood glucose levels. \nInsulin injections should be given within 2 hours of an unexplained high blood glucose value and \nsotagliflozin treatment should be interrupted. If ketones are high follow instructions given above in \nTable 1 (see section 4.2). \n \nSotagliflozin should only be given to patients: \n\n- with access to ketone testing materials and immediate access to a clinician if blood or urine \nketones are elevated. \n\n- who are able to monitor ketone levels and are educated in when it is most appropriate to do so.  \n \nDuring a dedicated counselling session with the patient at the time of first prescription of sotagliflozin \nthe Patient/Carer Guide and Patient Alert card, also available via the QRcode or website, should be \npresented. The Patient Alert Card is also provided in the product packaging. \n \nThe patient should be informed: \n\n- how to recognize the risk factors which can predispose to ketosis and DKA (including, but not \nlimited to, recent or recurrent history of DKA, missed or reduced insulin doses, decreased \ncaloric intake or severe dehydration, vigorous exercise, intercurrent illness, surgery, alcohol \nabuse, and in patients using an insulin infusion pump, insulin infusion interruption),  \n\n- how to recognize DKA signs or symptoms, emphasizing that DKA could occur even when \nblood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL), \n\n- when to discontinue sotagliflozin therapy (see section 4.2),  \n- what actions to take when ketosis/DKA is suspected.  \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIt is recommended that patients obtain several baseline blood or urine ketone levels over one to two \nweeks period prior to initiation of sotagliflozin therapy, and patients should become familiar with the \nbehaviours/circumstances associated with elevated ketone levels and how to address them.  \n \nManagement of DKA risk \nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue or sleepiness.  It is possible that adverse effects occurring with sotagliflozin may be similar to \npresenting symptoms of DKA. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these \nsymptoms occur, by measuring the urine or blood ketones, regardless of blood glucose level. DKA \nepisodes during sotagliflozin use can be atypical, with patients not having blood sugar levels as high \nas expected. This atypical presentation of DKA (i.e. normal or slightly elevated blood glucose levels) \ncan delay diagnosis and treatment. \n \nDuring treatment with sotagliflozin \n\n- The patient should remain on optimal insulin dosing.  \n- When needed to prevent hypoglycaemia, insulin dose reduction should be done cautiously to \n\navoid ketosis and DKA (see section 4.2). \n- Consider discontinuing sotagliflozin if adequate insulinisation cannot be achieved on \n\ntreatment. \n \nTreatment with sotagliflozin should be stopped in patients who are hospitalized for major surgical \nprocedures or acute serious medical illnesses. \n \nKetone monitoring during treatment \nAfter initiating sotagliflozin ketones should be monitored on a regular basis during the initial one to \ntwo weeks, then the frequency of ketone level testing should be individualised, according to the \npatient's lifestyle and/or risk factors. For all patients, it is recommended that ketones should be \nmeasured with changes to the normal routine, including reduced carbohydrate intake, intercurrent \nillness, reductions in total daily insulin dosing, physical activity and stress. Ketones should be \nmeasured repetitively when any signs or symptoms consistent with DKA or euglycaemic DKA are \npresent. Measurement of blood ketone levels is preferred over urine.  \n \nPatients must be informed about what actions to take if ketone levels are elevated. The recommended \nactions are listed in Table 1 (see section 4.2). \n \nManagement of DKA \nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with sotagliflozin should be discontinued \nimmediately. \n \nWith sotagliflozin DKA may be present with low, normal or high blood glucose levels. DKA should \nbe treated as per standard of care. Supplemental carbohydrate may be required based on glucose levels \nin addition to hydration and additional rapid acting insulin (see Table 1 in section 4.2).  \n \nRestarting sotagliflozin is not recommended, unless a cause for the ketoacidosis is identified and \nresolved (e.g., pump malfunction, acute intercurrent illness, excessive reduction of insulin). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRenal function abnormalities (increased serum creatinine and decreased eGFR) can occur after \ninitiating sotagliflozin (see section 4.8). Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these \nchanges.  \n \nSotagliflozin should not be initiated in patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min and should be \ndiscontinued at eGFR persistently below 45 mL/min (see section 4.2 and 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSotagliflozin should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment, end stage renal disease \n(ESRD) or in patients on dialysis as it has not been studied in these patients (see section 4.2). \n \nMonitoring of renal function is recommended as follows: \n\n- Prior to initiation of sotagliflozin and monitored periodically, at least yearly, thereafter (see \nsection 4.2).  \n\n- Prior to initiation of concomitant medicinal products that may reduce renal function and \nperiodically thereafter. \n\n- More frequent, at least 2 to 4 times per year, renal function monitoring is recommended in \npatients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere is limited experience in clinical trials in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. \nSotagliflozin is not recommended in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, as \nsotagliflozin exposure is increased in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nHypotension/ volume depletion \n \nBased on the mode of action of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, by increasing \nurinary glucose excretion (UGE), sotagliflozin induces an osmotic diuresis which may reduce \nintravascular volume and decrease blood pressure (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Sotagliflozin may cause \nintravascular volume contraction (see section 4.8). Symptomatic hypotension may occur after \ninitiating sotagliflozin particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low \nsystolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating sotagliflozin, volume contraction \nshould be assessed and volume status should be corrected if indicated. Patients should be monitored \nfor signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy. \n \nIn case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g., gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of \nvolume status (e.g., physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including \nhaematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving sotagliflozin. Temporary \ninterruption of treatment with sotagliflozin should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected. \n \nGenital mycotic infections  \n \nConsistent with the mechanism of SGLT2 inhibition with increased UGE, sotagliflozin increases the \nrisk for genital mycotic infections as reported in clinical trials (see section 4.8). \nPatients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections are more likely to develop \ngenital mycotic infections. Patients should be monitored and treated as appropriate. \n \nUrinary tract infections \nTemporary interruption of sotagliflozin should be considered when treating pyelonephritis and \nurosepsis. \n \nElderly patients \n \nElderly may be at an increased risk of volume depletion (see section 4.2). \n \nLower limb amputations \n \nAn increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in ongoing \nlong-term, clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class \neffect. Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot-\ncare.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) \n \nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), \nhave been reported in female and male patients taking other SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but \nserious and potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic \ntreatment. \n \nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotizing fasciitis. If Fournier’s \ngangrene is suspected, sotagliflozin should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including \nantibiotics and surgical debridement) should be instituted. \n \nUrine laboratory assessments  \n \nDue to its mechanism of action, patients taking sotagliflozin will test positive for glucose in their \nurine. \n \nDrug/Laboratory test interference  \n \nInterference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay \nMonitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are \nunreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking medicinal products that inhibit SGLT2. \nAlternative methods should be used to monitor glycaemic control. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on sotagliflozin   \n The coadministration of a multiple dosing regimen of rifampicin, an inducer of various UGT and \nCYP metabolizing enzymes, with a single dose of 400 mg sotagliflozin resulted in a decrease in the \nAUC0-inf (60%) and Cmax (40%) of sotagliflozin. This decrease in exposure to sotagliflozin may \ndecrease efficacy. If an enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) must be \nco-administered with sotagliflozin, consider frequent monitoring of glucose level. \n \nInteraction studies in healthy volunteers showed that metformin, metoprolol, midazolam, rosuvastatin \nand oral contraceptives had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin. \n \nEffects of sotagliflozin on other medicinal products   \nThere is an increase in AUC0-inf and Cmax of digoxin (27% and 52% respectively) when co-\nadministered with sotagliflozin 400mg, due to inhibition of P-gp by sotagliflozin. Patients taking \nsotagliflozin with concomitant digoxin should be monitored appropriately.  \n \nAn increase in total exposure and Cmax of rosuvastatin of ca 1.2- and 1.4-fold, respectively, was \ndemonstrated when co-administered with sotagliflozin and is not deemed clinically relevant. However, \nthe mechanism behind the limited increase in exposure is not completely elucidated as sotagliflozin \nand M19 (sotagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide) are characterized as BCRP inhibitors in vitro and M19 also \nas an inhibitor OATP1B3 and OAT3. Rosuvastatin is a known OATP, BCRP and OAT3 substrate. It \ncannot be ruled out that sotagliflozin may interact with other sensitive OAT3, OATP- and/or BCRP-\nsubstrates (e.g.: fexofenadine, paclitaxel, bosentan, methotrexate, furosemide, benzylpenicillin) \nresulting in potentially larger increases of exposure than seen for rosuvastatin. It should be evaluated if \nadditional safety monitoring is needed when using these substrates. \n \nBased on in-vitro data, induction of CYP2C9, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 cannot be ruled out. Substrates \nof these enzymes should be monitored for decreases in efficacy. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy volunteers show that sotagliflozin had no clinically relevant \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, metoprolol, midazolam and oral contraceptives. \n \nInsulin \nInsulin may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.  A lower dose of insulin may be required to minimise \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with sotagliflozin (see section 4.2). \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of sotagliflozin in pregnant women.  \nAnimal studies have shown that sotagliflozin crosses the placenta.  \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility and pregnancy \n(see section 5.3).  Pharmacologically-related reversible renal changes were observed in a rat postnatal \nstudy, corresponding to the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, sotagliflozin is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.  \nAs a precautionary measure, when pregnancy is detected, treatment with sotagliflozin should be \ndiscontinued. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNo data in humans are available on excretion of sotagliflozin into milk.  \nAvailable toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of sotagliflozin into milk.  \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \nSotagliflozin should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for sotagliflozin. Animal studies do \nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSotagliflozin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \nHowever, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia as sotagliflozin is used in \ncombination with insulin. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were genital mycotic infections, diabetic ketoacidosis \nand diarrhoea. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in the pool of two 52-week placebo-controlled \nclinical trials described above.  Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency \nand system organ class (SOC). Frequency categories are defined according to the following \nconvention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions  \nSystem Organ class Frequency of occurrence \n  Very common Common Uncommon \nInfections and infestations Female genital \n\nmycotic \ninfections*,a, † \n\nMale genital mycotic \ninfections*,b, † \nurinary tract infections*’ † \n \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\n  \nDiabetic ketoacidosis*’ †  \n \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  Volume depletion*, c, †  \nGastrointestinal disorders  Diarrhoea, flatulence \n\n \n \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders  Increased urinationd,  \nblood creatinine increased/ \nglomerular filtration \ndecreased† \n\n \n\nInvestigations  Blood ketone body \nincreased, serum lipids \nincreasede, haematocrit \nincreasedf \n\n \n\n* See section 4.4 \n† See subsections below for additional information. \na Adverse event grouping, including, but not limited to, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vaginal \ninfection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, genital infection, genital candidiasis, genital infection \nfungal, vulvovaginitis, urogenital infection fungal.  \nb Adverse event grouping, including, but not limited to, balanoposthitis, genital infections fungal, \nbalanitis candida, epididymitis. \n c Adverse events grouping, including dehydration, hypovolaemia, postural dizziness, orthostatic \nhypotension, hypotension, syncope and presyncope when reported in context of volume depletion. \ndAdverse events grouping, including urine output increased, polydipsia, micturition urgency, nocturia, \npollakiuria and polyuria \neMean percent changes from baseline for sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg versus placebo, \nrespectively, were HDL-C 3.3% and 4.2% versus 0.5%; LDL-C 5.0% and 6.1% versus 3.3%; \ntriglycerides 5.7% and 5.4% versus 2.7%. \nfThe proportion of subjects that met the criteria haematocrit >50% was higher in the sotagliflozin 200 \nmg and 400 mg groups (6.7% and 8.2%) compared to the placebo group (2.7%) \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDiabetic ketoacidosis \nIn placebo-controlled clinical trials of sotagliflozin, patients were advised to monitor urine or blood \nketones in case of suspected symptoms of DKA and seek medical advice/attention if their self-\nmeasured blood ketone reading was > 0.6 mmol/l. In the pooled 52-week data, the incidence of DKA \nwas increased in a dose-dependent manner for sotagliflozin (2.9% and 3.8% for sotagliflozin 200 mg \nand 400 mg, respectively) compared to placebo (0.2%). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate was \n3.12, 4.19 and 0.21 subjects per 100 patient-years for sotagliflozin 200 mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg and \nplacebo. Fifteen of the 35 cases (43%) experienced DKA with glucose values in the glycaemic range 8 \nto 14 mmol/L. In the broader pool, including all type 1 diabetes mellitus patients in phase 2 and 3 \nstudies, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate was 3.07, 5.29 and 0.76 subjects per 100 patient-years for \nsotagliflozin 200 mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nVolume depletion  \nSotagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and \nadverse reactions related to volume depletion. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., \nhypovolemia, blood pressure decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, \northostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 2.7%, 1.1% and 1.0% of patients treated with \nsotagliflozin 200mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo. Sotagliflozin may increase the risk of \nhypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction (see section 4.4). \n \nGenital mycotic infections \nThe incidence of female genital infections (e.g. vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, \nvulvovaginal candidiasis and vulvitis) was increased in the sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg group \n(15% and 17%, respectively) as compared to placebo (4.7%). Most of the events were mild or \nmoderate and no serious case was reported. Discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred \nin 1.2%, 1.1% and 0.8% of patients treated with sotagliflozin 200 mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg and \nplacebo, respectively.  \n \nThe incidence of male genital infections (e.g. balanoposthitis, genital infection fungal) was increased \nfor sotagliflozin 200 mg (3.0%), sotagliflozin 400 mg (6.3%) compared to placebo (1.1%). All events \nwere mild or moderate in intensity and no serious cases. Discontinuation due to genital mycotic \ninfections occurred in 0%, 0.4% and 0.4% of patients treated with sotagliflozin 200 mg, sotagliflozin \n400 mg and placebo, respectively.  \n \nUrinary tract infections \nThe overall frequency of urinary tract infections reported were 7.1% and 5.5% for sotagliflozin 200 \nmg and sotagliflozin 400 mg compared to 6.1% for placebo. The incidence of UTI in female subjects \nwas 12%, 7.0% and 11% and the incidence of UTI in male subjects was 2.3%, 4.0% and 1.8% for \nsotagliflozin 200 mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo, respectively. All UTI events were mild or \nmoderate in intensity except for one severe case (male subject in the sotagliflozin 400 mg group). Two \ncases (2 cases of cystitis) were serious; both occurred in male subjects in the sotagliflozin 400 mg \ngroup. \n \nBlood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration decreased and renal-related events \nSotagliflozin was associated with decreases in mean eGFR at week 4 (-4.0% and -4.3% for \nsotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg) versus placebo (-1.3%) that were generally reversible during \ncontinuous treatment. Mean increases in serum creatinine from baseline to week 4 was 4.0%, 4.3% \nand 1.4% for sotagliflozin 200mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo, respectively. At week 24 and 52 \nthe change from baseline in creatinine was equal to or less than 0.02 mg/dL for both sotagliflozin 200 \nand sotagliflozin 400 mg. \n \nThe incidence of renal-related events was low and similar across the groups (1.5%, 1.5% and 1.3% for \nsotagliflozin 200 mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 3: Changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFR in the pool of two 52-week placebo-\ncontrolled studies \n Placebo \n\n(N=526) \nSotagliflozin  \n200mg \n(N=524) \n\n Sotagliflozin  \n400 mg \n(N=525) \n\nMean baseline \nvalues \n\nN 526 524 525 \nCreatinine (mg/dL) 0.85 0.85 0.85 \neGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) 90.2 89.3 89.1 \n\nMean change from \nbaseline at week 4 \n\nN 511 502 505 \nCreatinine (mg/dL) 0.01 0.03 0.04 \neGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -1.15 -3.57 -3.81 \n\nMean change from \nbaseline at week 24 \n\nN 481 479 477 \nCreatinine (mg/dL) 0.01 0.02 0.02 \neGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -1.06 -1.79 -1.66 \n\nMean change from \nbaseline at week 52 \n\nN 374 392 380 \nCreatinine (mg/dL) 0.01 0.02 0.01 \neGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -0.70 -2.14 -0.57 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nMultiple doses of 800 mg once daily were administrated in healthy volunteers and these doses were \nwell tolerated. \nIn the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the \npatient's clinical status.  \nThe removal of sotagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) \ninhibitors, ATC code: A10BK06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of sodium glucose cotransporter type 1 (SGLT1) and SGLT2. Local \nintestinal inhibition of SGLT1, the major transporter for glucose absorption, delays and reduces \nglucose absorption in the proximal intestine, resulting in a blunting and delay of postprandial \nhyperglycaemia. SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from \nthe glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, sotagliflozin reduces renal \nreabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases \nurinary glucose excretion. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nUrinary glucose excretion  \nIn a 12-week dose ranging study, consistent with SGLT2 inhibition, 24-h placebo corrected change \nfrom baseline Urinary Glucose Excretion (UGE) increased by 57.7 grams (p<0.001) and 70.5 grams \n(p<0.001) in patients with type 1 diabetes taking 200 mg and 400 mg sotagliflozin respectively, which \nis consistent with SGLT2 inhibition.  \n \nPost prandial glucose reduction  \nIn a 12 week dose ranging study, consistent with SGLT1 inhibition, placebo corrected change from \nbaseline 2-hour post prandial glucose (PPG), measured after a standardised mixed meal, was reduced \nby 1.52 mmol/L (p=0.15) and 2.73 mmol/L (p=0.006) in patients taking 200 mg and 400 mg \nsotagliflozin respectively, which is consistent with SGLT1 inhibition.   \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nThe efficacy and safety of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes not adequately controlled on \ntheir current insulin therapy was evaluated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In \nInTandem1 (study 1) and in InTandem2 (study 2) sotagliflozin was used as add on to optimised insulin \nand in InTandem3 (Study 3) sotagliflozin was used as add on to any existing insulin regimen in \npatients not on HbA1c goal. \n \nStudy 1 and study 2 \nOn a background of optimised insulin, the efficacy and safety of sotagliflozin 200 mg or 400 mg once \ndaily versus insulin alone were evaluated in two double-blind, placebo controlled studies (study 1 \nand 2) performed in 1575 patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or multiple daily injection \ntherapy. Each study was of 52 weeks duration, with primary and key secondary endpoints at 24 weeks.  \nBeginning 6 weeks prior to randomization, insulin dose was adjusted (optimised) to achieve the \nfollowing glycaemic goals fasting/preprandial, self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) 4.4-7.2 mmol/L \nand 2-hour/peak postprandial SMBG glucose <10 mmol/L.  \nPatients were then maintained on optimised insulin and randomized to sotagliflozin 200 mg, \nsotagliflozin 400 mg or insulin alone. For the first meal on Day 1, patients were instructed to decrease \ntheir calculated (or usual) mealtime carbohydrate bolus insulin by 30%. Insulin optimisation was \ncontinued throughout the study.  \n \nIn study 1, a total of 793 patients entered the study. The mean age of patients was 46 years, 8.1% were \n65 years or older. Mean duration of diabetes was 24.4 years, 60% of patients were using insulin pump \nand 40% were using multiple daily injections.  In the study 48% were male and 92% were White and \n84% of randomised patients completed the study. The mean eGFR was 87 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 5.7% \nof patients had eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was 30 kg/m2 and 23% of \npatients had SBP ≥ 130 mmHg. At screening the HbA1c was 8.21%, 8.26% and 8.20% for insulin, \ninsulin+sotagliflozin 200 mg and insulin+sotagliflozin 400 mg. \n \nIn study 2, a total of 782 patients entered the study. The mean age of patients was 41 years, 4.2% were \n65 years or older. Mean duration of diabetes was 18 years, 26% of patients were using insulin pump \nand 74% were using multiple daily injections. In the study 52% were male and 96.2% were White and \n87% of randomised patients completed the study. The mean eGFR was 92 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 3.3% \nhad eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

No clinically relevant differences were noted between the two populations.   \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe median Tmax ranged from 1.25 to 3 hours, over a single-dose range of 400 to 2000 mg. Following \nadministration of multiple doses (400 and 800 mg dose), the median Tmax values ranged from 2.5 to 4 \nhours.  \nThe fraction of drug absorbed following administration of a single dose of [14C]-sotagliflozin was \nestimated to be at least 71%, based on the detected percentage of dose of radioactivity in the urine and \nfor the metabolites of sotagliflozin in the faeces.  \nWhen sotagliflozin tablets were administered with a high-caloric breakfast, plasma exposure to \nsotagliflozin as measured by Cmax and AUC0 inf was about 2.5- and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, \ncompared to fasted condition.  \n \nDistribution \n \nBoth sotagliflozin and its major human metabolite 3-O-glucuronide (M19), exhibited high binding to \nhuman plasma proteins in vitro (fraction unbound approx. 2%) which was not dependent on the \nconcentration of sotagliflozin and M19. In clinical studies the high protein binding was confirmed and \nwas not influenced by reduced renal or hepatic function.  \nThe apparent volume of distribution of sotagliflozin following administration of a single 400 mg oral \ndose of [14C]-sotagliflozin was found to be very high with a mean value of 9392 L.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn healthy subjects following the administration of a single dose of 400 mg [14C]-sotagliflozin \nindicated that sotagliflozin was extensively metabolized predominantly to M19 which represented \n94% of the radioactivity in plasma.  \nThe primary route of metabolism of sotagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5’-\ndiphospho-glucuronosyltransferases primarly by UGT1A9, and to a much lesser extent by UGT1A1 \nand UGT2B7 as well as oxidation, by CYP3A4. \nWhen sotagliflozin is incubated with UGT1A9, M19 was the main conjugate observed. No acyl \nglucuronides of sotagliflozin were identified. \n \nIn in vitro studies, sotagliflozin did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor induced CYP \n1A2, 2B6, or 3A4.   \nSotagliflozin and M19 have no significant potential to inhibit OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1 \nand OATP1B3.   \nM19 is an inducer and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of CYP2D6. \nIn vitro sotagliflozin was shown to have inhibitory effects on P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP). M19 demonstrated inhibitory effects against OATP1B1/B3 and MRP2 in-vitro. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nElimination/excretion \n \nFollowing the administration of a single dose of 400 mg [14C]-sotagliflozin, showed 57% and 37% of \nthe radioactivity were excreted in the urine and faeces, respectively. These results indicate that the \nmain route of elimination of drug related material was renal.   \nThe predominant metabolite detected in urine was M19, representing a mean of 33% of the \nadministered radioactive dose. Unchanged [14C]-sotagliflozin was the predominant radioactive peak \ndetected in faecal extracts representing a mean of 23% of the total administered radioactive dose. In \nhealthy volunteers, mean apparent total body clearance (CL/F) of sotagliflozin ranged from 261 to \n374 L/hr. The CL/F estimated using a population PK, which mostly evaluated T1DM patients, was \n239 L/hr. Mean terminal T1/2 ranged from 21 to 35 hours for sotagliflozin and from 19 to 26 hours for \nM19. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe PK of sotagliflozin appeared to be dose proportional in the therapeutic dose range of 200 mg to \n400 mg QD.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nExposure of sotagliflozin was evaluated in a dedicated study of subjects with mild (creatinine \nclearance [CLcr]: 60 to less than 90 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr: 30 to less than 60 mL/min) renal \nimpairment and with normal renal function. In subjects with renal impairment, exposure to \nsotagliflozin following a single dose of 400 mg was approximately 1.7 fold higher in subjects with \nmild and up to 2.7 fold higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function.   \nThe apparent clearance of sotagliflozin decreases with decreasing renal function. A population PK \nmodel integrating data from renally impaired patients and healthy subjects estimated for subjects with \nCKD Stage II (eGFR ≥60 and <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and CKD Stage IIIa (eGFR ≥45 and <60 \nmL/min/1.73 m2) that sotagliflozin exposures were 1.5 fold higher compared to subjects with normal \nrenal function. For subjects with CKD Stage IIIb (eGFR ≥30 and <45 mL/min/1.73 m2) and CKD \nStage IV (eGFR ≥15 and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) sotagliflozin exposures were 1.95 and 2.25 fold higher \ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nIn a study with subjects with reduced hepatic function, AUC of sotagliflozin was not increased in mild \n(Child Pugh A) hepatic impaired subjects, but was increased by ~3 fold in moderate (Child Pugh B) \nand ~ 6 fold in severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impaired subjects.  \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment.  \n \nElderly \nBased on a population PK analysis, age had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nsotagliflozin. \n \nBody weight  \nBased on a population PK analysis, sotagliflozin exposure was found to decrease with increased body \nweight. Consequently, low-weight patients may have somewhat increased exposure and patients with \nhigh weight somewhat decreased exposure. However, the differences in exposure were not considered \nclinically meaningful and therefore no dose adjustment is required based on weight. \n \nGender and race  \nBased on a population PK analysis gender and race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of \nsotagliflozin. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPaediatric patients \nNo data are available. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn a rat carcinogenicity study, a statistically significant increase in thyroid follicular cell carcinoma \nwas observed in males at 75 mg/kg/day, approx. 14 times the MRHD, the highest dose evaluated.  In a \nrepeat-dose study evaluating potential mechanisms responsible for the increase incidence of thyroid \ncarcinoma observed in the rat carcinogenicity study, it was concluded that the increase was associated \nwith a sotagliflozin-related increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In the rat, TSH was \nconsidered the primary carcinogen with sotagliflozin functioning as a secondary carcinogen. These \nchanges were not considered relevant for humans as TSH is not carcinogenic in humans. \n \nSotagliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic. \n \nIn a fertility study in rats, sotagliflozin had no effect on reproductive performance, fertility, and \nembryo/fetal viability. \n \nIn a juvenile toxicology study in rats, renal changes were observed when sotagliflozin was \nadministered during a period of renal development corresponding to the late second and third \ntrimesters of human pregnancy.  Exposure was approximately 5 times (males) and 11 times (females) \nthe clinical exposure at the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) and caused reversible \nrenal tubular dilation.   \nIn embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, sotagliflozin was orally administered at doses \nup to 350 mg/kg in rats and 200 mg/kg in rabbits.  In the rat study, embryo-lethality, effects on fetal \ngrowth along with cardiovascular and skeletal abnormalities were observed at an exposure multiple of \n158-times the human exposure at 400 mg/day. The adverse effects on embryo-fetal development at \n350 mg/kg/day were associated with maternal toxicity (body weight loss/decreased body weight gain \nand decreased food consumption during gestation day (GD) 6 to 8). Exposure at the rat no-observed-\neffect level was 40-times the exposure at the MRHD.  No developmental toxicity was observed at \ndoses up to 200 mg/kg/day in the rabbit, which was up to 9-times the human exposure at the MRHD. \n \nIn a pre-/post-natal development study, no sotagliflozin-related adverse effects in pregnant and \nlactating females and offspring development were observed in rats  \nIn a study evaluating the potential effects of sotagliflozin on the development of juvenile rats, no \nsotagliflozin-related toxicity was observed following the administration of oral doses up to \napproximately 18 and 31 fold that of the MRHD (400 mg/day) for males and females, respectively. \n \n \n6.

Read the Zynquista package leaflet for full information and \ninstructions for use. \n \nInformation for healthcare professionals: \nThis patient is using ZYNQUISTA for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). This \ntreatment is indicated as an adjunct to insulin therapy to improve glycaemic control in adults with \nT1DM with a BMI ≥27 kg/m2, who have failed to achieve adequate glycaemic control despite optimal \ninsulin therapy. \n \n• ZYNQUISTA increases the risk of DKA. DKA may occur in patients treated with Zynquista even \n\nif blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl). This atypical presentation of DKA can \ndelay diagnosis and treatment.  \n\n• For patients taking ZYNQUISTA, glucose is not a reliable marker for DKA and must be \nsupplemented with ketone monitoring \n\n• Signs and symptoms of DKA include: \n- nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain \n- anorexia \n- excessive thirst \n- unusual fatigue or sleepiness  \n- difficulty breathing \n- confusion \n\n• Hold Zynquista immediately if patient’s BHB level is > 0.6 mmol/L (1+ urine ketone) with \nsymptoms or if BHB > 1.5 mmol/L (2+ urine ketone) with or without symptoms. \n\n• Patients with euglycaemic DKA should receive glucose, insulin and fluids for DKA management, \nsotagliflozin should be discontinued. \n\n• ZYNQUISTA should be temporarily stopped before surgical procedures or hospitalisation for \nacute serious illness. \n \n \nPatient name:-------------------------- \nDate ZYNQUISTA first prescribed:--------------------------- \nCenter name:--------------------------- \nTreating HCP name:------------------ \nTreating HCP contact number:---------------------- \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB. PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n40 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nZynquista 200 mg film-coated tablets \nsotagliflozin \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Zynquista is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Zynquista  \n3. How to take Zynquista  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Zynquista  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zynquista is and what it is used for \n \nZynquista contains the active substance sotagliflozin, a medicine which lowers blood glucose (blood \nsugar) levels. Sotagliflozin works by slowing and reducing the absorption of glucose from food, and \nby increasing the amount of glucose that is passed out in urine. Together these actions help to lower \nthe increased amount of glucose in the blood that occurs in patients with diabetes. \n \nZynquista is used as an addition to insulin treatment in adults with type 1 diabetes with a body mass \nindex (BMI) greater than or equal to 27. BMI is a measure of your weight in relation to your \nheight.Type 1 diabetes is a disease where your body’s immune system destroys the insulin-producing \ncells in the pancreas and the body produces little to no insulin, the hormone that normally controls the \nlevel of your blood sugar. \n \nIt is important that you also continue with your diet and exercise plan and insulin treatment as agreed \nwith your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Zynquista  \n \nDo not take Zynquista: \n• if you are allergic to sotagliflozin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes \nbecause of increased levels of “ketone bodies” in your urine or blood, seen in tests. If you develop \nsymptoms contact your doctor or go to the nearest hospital right away. \n\n\n\n41 \n\nThe risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive \nalcohol consumption, drug abuse, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need for \ninsulin due to major surgery, serious illness or infection. See also section 4. \nIn addition to this leaflet, a patient alert card is included in the packaging which contains important \nsafety information that you need before and during treatment with Zynquista. Your doctor will \nschedule a dedicated education session, to discuss the risk of DKA, how to recognize DKA risk \nfactors, signs or symptoms, how and when to monitor ketone levels and what actions to take when \nketone levels are elevated. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Zynquista, and during treatment: \n• if you have the following symptoms, which may be a sign of a serious condition, diabetic \n\nketoacidosis (see also section 4): \no nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain  \no excessive thirst  \no constantly feeling tired  \no high levels of ketones in urine tests or beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in blood tests  \no difficulty breathing/rapid, deep breathing  \no breath with fruity odour  \no difficulty paying attention, or confusion  \no rapid weight loss  \n\n• if you have an acute medical illness or surgery \n• if you have no access to ketone testing materials or no immediate access to a doctor if blood or \n\nurine ketones are elevated \n• if you are using a low dose of insulin \n• if you are on caloric restriction, carbohydrate restriction or ketogenic diet  \n• if you had a recent or recurrent history of diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. 1 episode in the past 3 months \n\nor more than 1 episode in the past 6 months) \n• if you have kidney problems  \n• if you have liver problems  \n• if you have an infection of the kidney or the urinary tract. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking \n\nZynquista until you have recovered \n• if you have a history of chronic or recurrent yeast infections of the genitals (thrush)  \n• if you might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine \n\nproduction [diuretics] or lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old).
