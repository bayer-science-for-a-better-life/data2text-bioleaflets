NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nXaluprine 20 mg/ml oral suspension \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne ml of suspension contains 20 mg mercaptopurine (as monohydrate). \n\nExcipients with known effect \nOne ml of suspension contains 3 mg aspartame, 1 mg methyl hydroxybenzoate (as the sodium salt), \n0.5 mg ethyl hydroxybenzoate (as the sodium salt) and sucrose (trace). \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral suspension. \n\nThe suspension is pink to brown in colour. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nXaluprine is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents \nand children.  \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nXaluprine treatment should be supervised by a physician or other healthcare professionals experienced \nin the management of patients with ALL. \n\nPosology \nThe dose is governed by cautiously monitored haematotoxicity and the dose should be carefully \nadjusted to suit the individual patient in accordance with the employed treatment protocol. Depending \non phase of treatment, starting or target doses generally vary between 25-75 mg/m2 body surface area \n(BSA) per day, but should be lower in patients with reduced or absent Thiopurine Methyl Transferase \n(TPMT) enzyme activity (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n25 mg/m2 50 mg/m2 75 mg/m2 \n\nBSA (m2) Dose (mg) \nVolume \n\n(ml) BSA (m\n2) Dose (mg) \n\nVolume \n(ml) BSA (m\n\n2) Dose (mg) \nVolume \n\n(ml) \n\n0.20 - 0.29 6 0.3 0.20 - 0.23 10 0.5 0.20 - 0.23 16 0.8 \n\n0.30 - 0.36 8 0.4 0.24 \u2013 0.26 12 0.6 0.24 - 0.26 20 1.0 \n\n0.37 - 0.43 10 0.5 0.27 - 0.29 14 0.7 0.27 - 0.34 24 1.2 \n\n0.44 - 0.51 12 0.6 0.30 - 0.33 16 0.8 0.35 - 0.39 28 1.4 \n\n0.52 - 0.60 14 0.7 0.34 - 0.37 18 0.9 0.40 - 0.43 32 1.6 \n\n0.61 - 0.68 16 0.8 0.40 - 0.44 20 1.0 0.44 - 0.49 36 1.8 \n\n0.69 - 0.75 18 0.9 0.45 - 0.50 24 1.2 0.50 - 0.55 40 2.0 \n\n0.76 - 0.84 20 1.0 0.51 - 0.58 28 1.4 0.56 - 0.60 44 2.2 \n\n0.85 - 0.99 24 1.2 0.59 - 0.66 32 1.6 0.61 - 0.65 48 2.4 \n\n1.0 - 1.16 28 1.4 0.67 - 0.74 36 1.8 0.66 - 0.70 52 2.6 \n\n1.17 - 1.33 32 1.6 0.75 - 0.82 40 2.0 0.71 - 0.75 56 2.8 \n\n1.34 - 1.49 36 1.8 0.83 - 0.90 44 2.2 0.76 - 0.81 60 3.0 \n\n1.50 - 1.64 40 2.0 0.91 - 0.98 48 2.4 0.82 - 0.86 64 3.2 \n\n1.65 - 1.73 44 2.2 0.99 - 1.06 52 2.6 0.87 - 0.92 68 3.4 \n   1.07 - 1.13 56 2.8 0.93 - 0.97 72 3.6 \n   1.14 - 1.22 60 3.0 0.98 - 1.03 76 3.8 \n   1.23 - 1.31 64 3.2 1.04 - 1.08 80 4.0 \n   1.32 - 1.38 68 3.4 1.09 - 1.13 84 4.2 \n   1.39 - 1.46 72 3.6 1.14 - 1.18 88 4.4 \n   1.47 - 1.55 76 3.8 1.19 - 1.24 92 4.6 \n   1.56 - 1.63 80 4.0 1.25 - 1.29 96 4.8 \n   1.64 - 1.70 84 4.2 1.30 - 1.35 100 5.0 \n   1.71 - 1.73 88 4.4 1.36 - 1.40 104 5.2 \n      1.41 - 1.46 108 5.4 \n      1.47 - 1.51 112 5.6 \n      1.52 - 1.57 116 5.8 \n      1.58 - 1.62 120 6.0 \n      1.63 - 1.67 124 6.2 \n      1.68 - 1.73 128 6.4 \n\n \n6-mercaptopurine is metabolised by the polymorphic TPMT enzyme. Patients with little or no \ninherited TPMT activity are at increased risk for severe toxicity from conventional doses of \nmercaptopurine and generally require substantial dose reduction. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping \ncan be used to identify patients with absent or reduced TPMT activity. TPMT testing cannot substitute \nfor haematological monitoring in patients receiving Xaluprine. The optimal starting dose for \nhomozygous deficient patients has not been established (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nNo specific studies have been carried out in the elderly. However, it is advisable to monitor renal and \nhepatic function in these patients, and if there is any impairment, consideration should be given to \nreducing the Xaluprine dose. \n\nRenal impairment \nSince 6-mercaptopurine pharmacokinetics has not been formally studied in renal impairment, no \nspecific dose recommendations can be given. Since impaired renal function may result in slower \nelimination of mercaptopurine and its metabolites and therefore a greater cumulative effect, \nconsideration should be given to reduced starting doses in patients with impaired renal function. \nPatients should be closely monitored for dose related adverse reactions. \n\nHepatic impairment \nSince 6-mercaptopurine pharmacokinetics has not been formally studied in hepatic impairment, no \nspecific dose recommendations can be given. Since there is a potential for reduced elimination of \nmercaptopurine, consideration should be given to reduced starting doses in patients with impaired \nhepatic function. Patients should be closely monitored for dose related adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nSwitching between tablet and oral suspension and vice versa \nA tablet form of 6-mercaptopurine is also available. The 6-mecaptopurine oral suspension and tablet \nare not bioequivalent with respect to peak plasma concentration, and therefore intensified \nhaematological monitoring of the patient is advised on switching formulations (see section 5.2). \n\nCombination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors \nAllopurinol and other xanthine oxidase inhibitors decrease the rate of catabolism of 6-mercaptopurine.  \nWhen allopurinol and 6-mercaptopurine are administered concomitantly it is essential that only a \nquarter of the usual dose of 6-mercaptopurine is given. Other xanthine oxidase inhibitors should be \navoided (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients with NUDT15 variant \nPatients with inherited mutated NUDT15 gene are at increased risk for severe 6-mercaptopurine \ntoxicity, (see 4.4). These patients generally require dose reduction; particularly those being NUDT15 \nvariant homozygotes (see 4.4). Genotypic testing of NUDT15 variants may be considered before \ninitiating 6-mercaptopurine therapy. In any case, close monitoring of blood counts is necessary. \n\nMethod of administration \nXaluprine is for oral use and requires redispersing (by shaking vigorously at least for 30 seconds) prior \nto dosing. \n\nTwo dosing syringes (a purple syringe graduated to 1 ml and a white syringe graduated to 5 ml) are \nprovided for accurate measurement of the prescribed dose of the oral suspension. It is recommended \nthat the healthcare professional advises the patient or carer which syringe to use to ensure that the \ncorrect volume is administered. \n\nXaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach, but patients should standardise the method \nof administration. The dose should not be taken with milk or dairy products (see section 4.5).  \nXaluprine should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after milk or dairy products. \n\n6-mercaptopurine displays diurnal variation in pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Administration in the\nevening compared to morning administration may lower the risk of relapse. Therefore the daily dose\nof Xaluprine should be taken in the evening.\n\nTo assist accurate and consistent dose delivery to the stomach water should be taken after each dose of \nXaluprine. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant use with yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCytotoxicity and haematological monitoring \nTreatment with 6-mercaptopurine causes bone marrow suppression leading to leucopenia and \nthrombocytopenia and, less frequently, to anaemia. Careful monitoring of haematological parameters \nshould be conducted during therapy. The leucocyte and platelet counts continue to fall after treatment \nis stopped, so at the first sign of an abnormally large fall in the counts, treatment should be interrupted \nimmediately. Bone marrow suppression is reversible if 6-mercaptopurine is withdrawn early enough. \n \nThere are individuals with an inherited deficiency of the TPMT enzyme activity who are very \nsensitive to the myelosuppresive effect of 6-mercaptopurine and prone to developing rapid bone \nmarrow depression following the initiation of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine. This problem could be \nexacerbated by coadministration with active substances that inhibit TPMT, such as olsalazine, \nmesalazine or sulfasalazine. Some laboratories offer testing for TPMT deficiency, although these tests \nhave not been shown to identify all patients at risk of severe toxicity. Therefore close monitoring of \nblood counts is necessary. Substantial dose reductions are generally required for homozygous-TPMT \ndeficiency patients to avoid the development of life threatening bone marrow suppression. \n \nA possible association between decreased TPMT activity and secondary leukaemias and \nmyelodysplasia has been reported in individuals receiving 6-mercaptopurine in combination with other \ncytotoxics (see section 4.8). \n \nImmunosuppression \nImmunisation using a live organism vaccine has the potential to cause infection in \nimmunocompromised hosts. Therefore, immunisations with live organism vaccines are not \nrecommended. \n \nHepatotoxicity \nXaluprine is hepatotoxic and liver function tests should be monitored weekly during treatment. More \nfrequent monitoring may be advisable in those with pre-existing liver disease or receiving other \npotentially hepatotoxic therapy. The patient should be instructed to discontinue Xaluprine immediately \nif jaundice becomes apparent (see section 4.8).  \n \nRenal toxicity \nDuring remission induction when rapid cell lysis is occurring, uric acid levels in blood and urine \nshould be monitored as hyperuricaemia and/or hyperuricosuria may develop, with the risk of uric acid \nnephropathy. Hydration and urine alkalinisation may minimize potential renal complications. \n \nPancreatitis in off-label treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease \nPancreatitis has been reported to occur at a frequency of \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10 (\u201ccommon\u201d) in patients \ntreated for the unlicensed indication inflammatory bowel disease.  \n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of \ndeveloping lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma \nand non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The \nincreased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been \nreported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the \nlymphoproliferative disorder. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nA treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore \nbe used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. \nA combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of \nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. \n\nIncreases in chromosomal aberrations were observed in the peripheral lymphocytes of leukaemic \npatients, in a renal cell carcinoma patient who received an unstated dose of 6-mercaptopurine and in \npatients with chronic renal disease treated at doses of 0.4 \u2013 1.0 mg/kg/day.  \n\nIn view of its action on cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 6-mercaptopurine is potentially \ncarcinogenic and consideration should be given to the theoretical risk of carcinogenesis with this \ntreatment.  \n\nHepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease* \ntreated with azathioprine (the prodrug to 6-mercaptopurine) or 6-mercaptopurine, either with or \nwithout concomitant treatment with anti-TNF alpha antibody. This rare type of T cell lymphoma has \nan aggressive disease course and is usually fatal (see also section 4.8). \n*inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an unlicensed indication\n\nMacrophage activation syndrome \nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in \npatients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (unlicensed \nindication), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with \nthe use of mercaptopurine. If MAS occurs, or is suspected, evaluation and treatment should be started \nas early as possible, and treatment with mercaptopurine should be discontinued. Physicians should be \nattentive to symptoms of infection such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known \ntriggers for MAS. \n\nInfections \nPatients treated with 6-mercaptopurine alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents, \nincluding corticosteroids, have shown increased susceptibility to viral, fungal and bacterial infections, \nincluding severe or atypical infection, and viral reactivation. The infectious disease and complications \nmay be more severe in these patients than in non-treated patients. \n\nPrior exposure to or infection with varicella zoster virus should be taken into consideration prior to \nstarting treatment. Local guidelines may be considered, including prophylactic therapy if necessary. \nSerologic testing prior to starting treatment should be considered with respect to hepatitis B. Local \nguidelines may be considered, including prophylactic therapy for cases which have been confirmed \npositive by serologic testing. Cases of neutropenic sepsis have been reported in patients receiving \n6-mercaptopurine for ALL.\n\nPatients with NUDT15 variant \nPatients with inherited mutated NUDT15 gene are at increased risk for severe 6-mercaptopurine \ntoxicity, such as early leukopenia and alopecia, from conventional doses of thiopurine therapy. They \ngenerally require dose reduction, particularly those being NUDT15 variant homozygotes (see 4.2). \nThe frequency of NUDT15 c.415C>T has an ethnic variability of approximately 10 % in East Asians, \n4 % in Hispanics, 0.2 % in Europeans and 0 % in Africans. In any case, close monitoring of blood \ncounts is necessary. \n\nPaediatric population \nCases of symptomatic hypoglycaemia have been reported in children with ALL receiving \n6-mercaptopurine (see section 4.8). The majority of reported cases were in children under the age of\nsix or with a low body mass index.\n\nInteractions \nWhen oral anticoagulants are coadministered with 6-mercaptopurine, a reinforced monitoring of INR \n(International Normalised Ratio) is recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nExcipients  \nThis medicinal product contains aspartame (E951), a source of phenylalanine. May be harmful for \npeople with phenylketonuria. Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame \nuse in infants below 12 weeks of age. \n \nIt also contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate which \nmay cause allergic reaction (possibly delayed). \n \nThis medicine contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, \nglucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. \nLong term use increases the risk of dental caries and it is essential that adequate dental hygiene is \nmaintained. \n \nSafe handling of the suspension  \nParents and care givers should avoid Xaluprine contact with skin or mucous membrane. If the \nsuspension comes into contact with skin or mucosa, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly \nwith soap and water (see section 6.6). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe administration of 6-mercaptopurine with food may decrease systemic exposure slightly but this is \nunlikely to be of clinical significance. Therefore, Xaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty \nstomach, but patients should standardise the method of administration. The dose should not be taken \nwith milk or dairy products since they contain xanthine oxidase, an enzyme which metabolises 6\u2013\nmercaptopurine and might therefore lead to reduced plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine. \n \nEffects of mercaptopurine on other medicinal products \nConcomitant administration of yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated, due to the risk of fatal disease \nin immunocompromised patients (see section 4.3). \n \nVaccinations with other live organism vaccines are not recommended in immunocompromised \nindividuals (see section 4.4).  \n \nInhibition of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, when given with 6-mercaptopurine, has been \nreported. Monitoring of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) value is recommended during \nconcomitant administration with oral anticoagulants. \n \nCytotoxic agents may decrease the intestinal absorption of phenytoin. Careful monitoring of the \nphenytoin serum levels is recommended. It is possible that the levels of other anti-epileptic medicinal \nproducts may also be altered. Serum antiepileptic levels should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith Xaluprine, making dose adjustments as necessary. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on mercaptopurine \nWhen allopurinol and Xaluprine are administered concomitantly it is essential that only a quarter of \nthe usual dose of Xaluprine is given since allopurinol decreases the rate of metabolism of \n6-mercaptopurine  via xanthine oxidase. Also other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as febuxostat, \nmay decrease the metabolism of mercaptopurine and concomitant administration is not recommended \nas data are insufficient to determine an adequate dose reduction. \n \nAs there is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (eg. olsalazine, mesalazine or \nsulfazalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which metabolises 6-mercaptopurine, they should be \nadministered with caution to patients receiving concurrent Xaluprine therapy (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n\n\n\n8 \n\nEvidence of the teratogenicity of 6-mercaptopurine in humans is equivocal. Both sexually active men \nand women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and for at least three \nmonths after receiving the last dose. Animal studies indicate embryotoxic and embryolethal effects \n(see section 5.3). \n \nPregnancy \nXaluprine should not be given to patients who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant without \ncareful assessment of risk versus benefit. \n \nThere have been reports of premature birth and low birth weight following maternal exposure to \n6-mercaptopurine. There have also been reports of congenital abnormalities and spontaneous abortion \nfollowing either maternal or paternal exposure. Multiple congenital abnormalities have been reported \nfollowing maternal 6-mercatopurine treatment in combination with other chemotherapy agents. \n \nA more recent epidemiological report suggests that there is no increased risk of preterm births, low \nbirth weight at term, or congenital abnormalities in women exposed to mercaptopurine during \npregnancy. \n \nIt is recommended that newborns of women exposed to mercaptopurine during pregnancy are \nmonitored for haematological and immune system disturbances. \n \nBreast-feeding \n6-mercaptopurine has been identified in the colostrum and breast-milk of women receiving \nazathioprine treatment and thus women receiving Xaluprine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \nThe effect of 6-mercaptopurine therapy on human fertility is unknown but there are reports of \nsuccessful fatherhood/motherhood after receiving treatment during childhood or adolescence. \nTransient profound oligospermia has been reported following exposure to 6-mercaptopurine in \ncombination with corticosteroids. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. A detrimental \neffect on these activities cannot be predicted from the pharmacology of the active substance. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe main adverse reaction of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine is bone marrow suppression leading to \nleucopenia and thrombocytopenia. \n \nFor mercaptopurine there is a lack of modern clinical documentation which can serve as support for \naccurately determining the frequency of adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following events have been identified as adverse reactions. The adverse reactions are displayed by \nsystem organ class and frequency: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1000 to < 1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon Bacterial and viral infections, infections associated with \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nneutropenia \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (including \ncysts and polyps) \n\nRare \n\nNeoplasms including \nlymphoproliferative \ndisorders, skin cancers \n(melanomas and \nnon-melanomas), sarcomas \n(Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) \nand uterine cervical cancer in \nsitu (see section 4.4) \n\nVery rare Secondary leukaemia and myelodysplasia \n\nUnknown Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma* (see section 4.4) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nVery common \nBone marrow suppression; \nleucopenia and \nthrombocytopenia \n\nCommon Anaemia \n\nImmune system disorders \nUncommon Arthralgia, skin rash, drug fever \nRare Facial oedema \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon Anorexia \nUnknown Hypoglycaemia\u2020 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon Stomatitis, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea  \nUncommon Pancreatitis, oral ulceration \nVery rare Intestinal ulceration \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nCommon Biliary stasis, hepatotoxicity \nUncommon Hepatic necrosis \n\nUnknown \n\nPortal hypertension*, nodular \nregenerative hyperplasia*, \nsinusoidal obstruction \nsyndrome*  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRare Alopecia \nUnknown Photosensitivity reaction \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders Rare Transient oligospermia \n\n* In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unlicensed indication. \n\u2020 In the paediatric population. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n6-mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic in animals and man. The histological findings in man have shown \nhepatic necrosis and biliary stasis  \n \nThe incidence of hepatotoxicity varies considerably and can occur with any dose but more frequently \nwhen the recommended dose is exceeded.  \n \nMonitoring of liver function tests may allow early detection of hepatotoxicity. This is usually \nreversible if 6-mercaptopurine therapy is stopped soon enough but fatal liver damage has occurred.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n10 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSymptoms and signs \nGastrointestinal effects, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and anorexia may be early \nsymptoms of overdose having occurred. The principal toxic effect is on the bone marrow, resulting in \nmyelosuppression. Haematological toxicity is likely to be more profound with chronic overdose than \nwith a single ingestion of Xaluprine. Liver dysfunction and gastroenteritis may also occur.  \nThe risk of overdose is also increased when xanthine oxidase inhibitors is being given concomitantly \nwith 6-mercaptopurine (see section 4.5).  \n\nManagement \nAs there is no known antidote the blood picture should be closely monitored and general supportive \nmeasures, together with appropriate blood transfusion, instituted if necessary. Active measures (such \nas the use of activated charcoal or gastric lavage) may not be effective in the event of \n6-mercaptopurine overdose unless the procedure can be undertaken within 60 minutes of ingestion.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, purine analogues, ATC \ncode: L01BB02 \n\nMechanism of action \n6-mercaptopurine is an inactive pro-drug which acts as a purine antagonist but requires cellular uptake\nand intracellular anabolism to thioguanine nucleotides for cytotoxicity. The 6-mercaptopurine\nmetabolites inhibit de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. The thioguanine\nnucleotides are also incorporated into nucleic acids and this contributes to the cytotoxic effects of the\nactive substance.\n\nCross-resistance usually exists between 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nThe bioavailability of oral 6-mercaptopurine shows considerable inter-individual variability, which \nprobably results from its first-pass metabolism. When administered orally at a dosage of 75 mg/m2 \nto 7 paediatric patients, the bioavailability averaged 16% of the administered dose, with a range of 5 to \n37%.  \n\nIn a comparative bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers (n=60), 50mg of Xaluprine oral \nsuspension was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the reference 50mg tablet for AUC, but not Cmax. \nThe mean (90% CI) Cmax with the oral suspension was 39% (22% - 58%) higher than the tablet \nalthough there was less between-subject variability (%C.V) with the oral suspension (46%) than the \ntablet (69%). \n\nBiotransformation \nThe intracellular anabolism of 6-merpactopurine is catalysed by several enzymes to eventually form \n6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), but a variety of intermediary TGNs are formed en route to the\nTGNs. The first step is catalysed by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase yielding\nthioinosine monophosphate (TIMP). 6-mercaptopurine  is also subject to S-methylation by the enzyme\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nthiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), yielding methylmercaptopurine, which is inactive. However, \nTPMT also catalyses the S-methylation of the principle nucleotide metabolite, TIMP, to form \nmethylthioinosine monophosphate (mTIMP). Both TIMP and mTIMP are inhibitors of phosphoribosyl \npyrophosphate amidotransferase, an enzyme which is important in de novo purine synthesis. Xanthine \noxidase is the main catabolic enzyme and it converts the 6-mercaptopurine into the inactive \nmetabolite, 6-thiouric acid. This is excreted in the urine. Approximately 7% of an oral dose is excreted \nas unchanged 6-mercaptopurine within 12 hours after administration. \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life of 6-mercaptopurine is 90 \u00b1 30 minutes, but the active metabolites have a \nlonger half-life (approximately 5 hours) than the parent compound. The apparent body clearance is \n4832 \u00b1 2562 ml/min/m2. There is low entry of 6-mercaptopurine into the cerebrospinal fluid.  \n \nThe main route of elimination for 6-mercaptopurine is by metabolism. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGenotoxicity \n6-mercaptopurine, in common with other antimetabolites, is mutagenic and causes chromosomal \naberrations in vitro and in vivo in mice and rats.  \n \nCarcinogenicity \nGiven its genotoxic potential, 6-mercaptopurine is potentially carcinogenic. \n \nTeratogenicity  \n6-mercaptopurine causes embryolethality and severe teratogenic effects in the mouse, rat, hamster and \nrabbit at doses that are non-toxic to the mother. In all species, the degree of embryotoxicity and the \ntype of malformations are dependent on the dose and stage of the gestation at the time of \nadministration. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n24 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nXaluprine 20 mg/ml oral suspension \nmercaptopurine \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Xaluprine is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Xaluprine \n3. How to take Xaluprine \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Xaluprine \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xaluprine is and what it is used for \n \nXaluprine contains mercaptopurine. This belongs to a group of medicines called cytotoxics (also \ncalled chemotherapy). \n \nXaluprine is used for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (also called acute lymphocytic leukaemia or \nALL). This is a fast-growing disease which increases the number of new white blood cells.  These new \nwhite blood cells are immature (not fully formed) and unable to grow and work properly.  They \ntherefore cannot fight infections and may cause bleeding. \n \nAsk your doctor if you would like more explanation about this disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xaluprine \n \n- Do not take Xaluprine if you are allergic to mercaptopurine or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n- Do not get vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine whilst you are taking Xaluprine because it \n\nmay be fatal. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xaluprine \n- if you have been vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine \n- if you have kidney or liver problems, as your doctor will need to check that they are working \n\nproperly. \n- if you have a condition where your body produces too little of the enzyme called TPMT \n\n(thiopurine methyltransferase), as your doctor may need to adjust the dose.  \n- if you are planning to have a baby.  This applies to both men and women.  Xaluprine may harm \n\nyour sperm or eggs (see \u2018Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\u2019 below).   \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nIf you are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, taking Xaluprine could put you at greater risk of: \n- tumours, including skin cancer. Therefore, when taking Xaluprine, avoid excessive exposure to \n\nsunlight, wear protective clothing and use protective sunscreen with a high protection factor \n- lymphoproliferative disorders \n\no treatment with Xaluprine increases your risk of getting a type of cancer called \nlymphoproliferative disorder. With treatment regimen containing multiple \nimmunosuppressants (including thiopurines), this may lead to death. \n\no A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the \nrisk of disorders of the lymph system due to a viral infection (Epstein-Barr virus \n(EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders). \n\n \nTaking Xaluprine could put you at greater risk of: \n- developing a serious condition called Macrophage Activation Syndrome (excessive activation \n\nof white blood cells associated with inflammation), which usually occurs in people who have \ncertain types of arthritis. \n\n \nSome patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have received 6-mercaptopurine have developed \na rare and aggressive type of cancer called Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (see section 4, Possible \nside effects).  \n \nInfections \nWhen you are treated with Xaluprine the risk of viral, fungal and bacterial infections is increased and \nthe infections may be more serious. See also section 4. \n \nTell your doctor before starting treatment whether or not you have had chickenpox, shingles or \nhepatitis B (a liver disease caused by a virus). \n \nNUDT15-gene mutation \nIf you have an inherited mutation in the NUDT15-gene (a gene which is involved in the break-down \nof Xaluprine in the body), you have a higher risk of infections and hair loss and your doctor may in \nthis case give you a lower dose. \n \nAvoid contact of Xaluprine with your skin, eyes or nose. If you accidentally get some in your eyes or \nnose, flush the area with water. \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nXaluprine. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nLow blood sugar has sometimes been seen in children, mainly in children under the age of six or with \na low body mass index. Talk to your child\u00b4s doctor if this happens. \n \nOther medicines and Xaluprine \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n \n- other cytotoxic medicines (chemotherapy) - when used with Xaluprine there is a greater chance \n\nof side effects, such as anaemia \n- allopurinol or febuxostat (used to treat gout) \n- oral anticoagulants (used to thin the blood) \n- olsalazine or mesalazine (used for a bowel disorder called ulcerative colitis) \n- sulfasalazine (used for rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis). \n- anti-epileptic medicines such as phenytoin, carbamazepine. Blood levels of anti-epileptic \n\nmedicines may need to be monitored and doses adjusted if necessary. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nHaving vaccines while you are taking Xaluprine \nIf you are going to have a vaccination it is important to speak to your doctor or nurse before you have \nit.  Vaccination with live vaccines (like polio, measles, mumps and rubella) is not recommended, as \nthese vaccines may give you an infection if you have them whilst you are taking Xaluprine.  \n \nXaluprine with food and drink \nXaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach. However, the choice of method should be \nconsistent from day to day.  \n \nDo not take Xaluprine at the same time as milk or dairy products, as they can make the medicine less \neffective.  Xaluprine should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after milk or dairy products. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nDo not take Xaluprine if you are planning to have a baby without first speaking to your doctor for \nadvice.  This applies to both men and women.  Xaluprine may harm your sperm or eggs.  Reliable \ncontraception must be used to avoid pregnancy whilst you or your partner are taking Xaluprine.  Both \nmen and women should continue to use effective contraception for at least 3 months after stopping \ntreatment.  If you are already pregnant, you must talk to your doctor before taking Xaluprine.  \n \nXaluprine should not be handled by women who are or planning to be pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDo not breast-feed while taking Xaluprine.  Ask your doctor, pharmacist or midwife for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not expected that Xaluprine will affect your ability to drive or use machines but no studies have \nbeen done to confirm this. \n \nXaluprine contains aspartame, sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219), sodium ethyl \nparahydroxybenzoate (E215) and sucrose \nThis medicine contains 3 mg aspartame (E951) in each 1 ml. Aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. \nIt may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine \nbuilds up because the body cannot remove it properly.  \n \nXaluprine also contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and sodium ethyl \nparahydroxybenzoate (E215) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).  \n \nXaluprine contains sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. May be harmful to the teeth. \n \n \n3. How to take Xaluprine \n \nXaluprine should only be given to you by a specialist doctor who is experienced in treating blood \nproblems.  \n \n- When you take Xaluprine your doctor will take regular blood tests. This is to check the number \n\nand type of cells in your blood and to ensure your liver is working correctly. \n- Your doctor may also ask for other blood and urine tests to monitor your uric acid levels. Uric \n\nacid is a natural body chemical, levels of which can rise while taking Xaluprine. \n- Your doctor may sometimes change your dose of Xaluprine as a result of these tests. \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. The usual starting dose for adults, adolescents and children is \nbetween 25-75 mg/m2 body surface area each day. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. \nSometimes the doctor may change your dose of Xaluprine for example as a result of different tests. If \nyou are not sure how much medicine to take, always ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nIt is important to take Xaluprine in the evening to make the medicine more effective. \n \nYou can take your medicine with food or on an empty stomach but the choice of method should be \nconsistent from day to day. You should take your medicine at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after \nhaving milk or dairy products. \n \nYour pack of Xaluprine contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes \n(a purple 1 ml syringe and a white 5 ml syringe). Always use the syringes provided to take your \nmedicine. \n \nIt is important that you use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist \nwill advise which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed.  \n \nThe smaller 1 ml syringe (purple), marked from 0.1 ml to 1 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or \nequal to 1 ml. You should use this one if the total amount you have to take is less than or equal to 1 ml \n(each graduation of 0.1 ml contains 2 mg of mercaptopurine).  \nThe larger 5 ml syringe (white), marked 1 ml to 5 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 1 ml. You \nshould use this one if the total amount you have to take is more than 1 ml (each graduation of 0.2 ml \ncontains 4 mg of mercaptopurine). \n \nIf you are a parent or care giver administering the medicine, wash your hands before and after \nadministering a dose. Wipe up spillages immediately. To decrease the risk of exposure disposable \ngloves should be used when handling Xaluprine. \n \nIf Xaluprine comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, it should be washed immediately and \nthoroughly with soap and water. \n \nWhen you use the medicine follow the instructions below: \n\n \n \n1. Put on disposable hand gloves before handling Xaluprine. \n2. Shake the bottle vigorously for at least 30 seconds to ensure the medicine is well mixed \n(figure 1). \n3. Remove the bottle cap (figure 2) and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle and leave in \nplace for future doses (figure 3).  \n4. Push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor (figure 4). Your doctor or \npharmacist will advise you of the correct syringe to use, either the 1 ml (purple syringe) or the \n5 ml (white syringe) in order to give the correct dose.  \n5. Turn the bottle upside down (figure 5).  \n6. Pull the plunger of the syringe back so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the syringe. \nPull the plunger back to the point on the scale that corresponds to the dose prescribed (figure 5). If \nyou are not sure about how much medicine to draw into the syringe, always ask your doctor or nurse \nfor advice.  \n7. Turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, holding it \nby the barrel rather than the plunger.  \n8. Gently put the tip of the syringe into your mouth and to the inside of your cheek.  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n9. Slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of your cheek \nand swallow it. DO NOT forcefully push down the plunger, or squirt the medicine to the back of your \nmouth or throat, as you may choke.  \n10. Remove the syringe from your mouth.  \n11. Swallow the dose of oral suspension then drink some water, making sure no medicine is left in \nyour mouth. \n12. Put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place.  Ensure that the cap is tightly closed. \n13. Wash the syringe with warm water and rinse well. Hold the syringe under water and move the \nplunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the syringe is clean. Let the syringe air \ndry completely before you use that syringe again for dosing. Do not wipe dry. Store the syringe in a \nhygienic place with the medicine. \n \nRepeat the above for each dose as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nIf you take more Xaluprine than you should \nIf you take more Xaluprine than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital immediately.  You \nmay feel sick, vomit or have diarrhoea. Take the medicine pack and this leaflet with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Xaluprine \nTell your doctor.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Xaluprine \nDo not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to or you may get a relapse of your \ncondition. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you get any of the following side effects, talk to your specialist doctor or go to hospital \nimmediately: \n \n- Allergic reaction, the signs may include: \n\no skin rashes \no high temperature \no joint pain \no swollen face \n\n \n- Any signs of fever or infection (sore throat, sore mouth or urinary problems) \n \n- Any unexpected bruising or bleeding, as this could mean that too few blood cells of a particular \n\ntype are being produced \n \n- If you suddenly feel unwell (even with a normal temperature) and have abdominal pain and \n\nsickness, as this could be a sign of an inflamed pancreas \n \n- Any yellowing of the whites of the eyes or skin (jaundice) \n \n- If you have diarrhoea \n \nTalk to your doctor if you have any of the following side effects which may also happen with this \nmedicine: \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n\n\n29 \n\n- a drop in the number of white blood cells and platelets (may show up in blood tests) \n \nCommon (affects less than 1 in 10 people) \n- feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting) \n- liver damage - this may show up in blood tests \n- a drop in red blood cells which may make you tired, weak or breathless (called anaemia) \n- loss of appetite \n- diarrhoea \n- inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis) \n \nUncommon (affects less than 1 in 100 people) \n- mouth ulcers \n- inflamed pancreas \n- joint pain \n- skin rash \n- fever \n- permanent damage to the liver (hepatic necrosis) \n \nRare (affects less than 1 in 1,000 people) \n- hair loss \n- in men: temporary low sperm count \n- swollen face \n- various types of cancers including blood, lymph and skin cancers \n \nVery rare (affects less than 1 in 10,000 people) \n- a different type of leukaemia to that being treated \n- ulcers in the intestines \n \nOther side effects (the frequency is unknown)  \n- a rare type of cancer (hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma), (see section 2, Warnings and \n\nPrecautions). \n- Sensitivity to sunlight causing skin reactions \n \nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) - the frequency is unknown.  \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

of this medicine (listed in section 6). - do not get vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine whilst you are taking xaluprine because it may be fatal. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking xaluprine - if you have been vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine - if you have kidney or liver problems, as your doctor will need to check that they are working properly. - if you have a condition where your body produces too little of the enzyme called tpmt (thiopurine methyltransferase), as your doctor may need to adjust the dose. - if you are planning to have a baby. this applies to both men and women. xaluprine may harm your sperm or eggs (see 'pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility' below). if you are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, taking xaluprine could put you at greater risk of: - tumours, including skin cancer. therefore, when taking xaluprine, avoid excessive exposure to sunlight, wear protective clothing and use protective sunscreen with a high protection factor - lymphoproliferative disorders o treatment with xaluprine increases your risk of getting a type of cancer called lymphoproliferative disorder. with treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines), this may lead to death. o a combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of disorders of the lymph system due to a viral infection (epstein-barr virus (ebv)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders). taking xaluprine could put you at greater risk of: - developing a serious condition called macrophage activation syndrome (excessive activation of white blood cells associated with inflammation), which usually occurs in people who have certain types of arthritis. some patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have received 6-mercaptopurine have developed a rare and aggressive type of cancer called hepatosplenic t-cell lymphoma (see section 4, possible side effects). infections when you are treated with xaluprine the risk of viral, fungal and bacterial infections is increased and the infections may be more serious. see also section 4. tell your doctor before starting treatment whether or not you have had chickenpox, shingles or hepatitis b (a liver disease caused by a virus). nudt15-gene mutation if you have an inherited mutation in the nudt15-gene (a gene which is involved in the break-down of xaluprine in the body), you have a higher risk of infections and hair loss and your doctor may in this case give you a lower dose. avoid contact of xaluprine with your skin, eyes or nose. if you accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water. if you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking xaluprine. children and adolescents low blood sugar has sometimes been seen in children, mainly in children under the age of six or with a low body mass index. talk to your child\u00b4s doctor if this happens. other medicines and xaluprine tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. in particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: - other cytotoxic medicines (chemotherapy) - when used with xaluprine there is a greater chance of side effects, such as anaemia - allopurinol or febuxostat (used to treat gout) - oral anticoagulants (used to thin the blood) - olsalazine or mesalazine (used for a bowel disorder called ulcerative colitis) - sulfasalazine (used for rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis). - anti-epileptic medicines such as phenytoin, carbamazepine. blood levels of anti-epileptic medicines may need to be monitored and doses adjusted if necessary. having vaccines while you are taking xaluprine if you are going to have a vaccination it is important to speak to your doctor or nurse before you have it. vaccination with live vaccines (like polio, measles, mumps and rubella) is not recommended, as these vaccines may give you an infection if you have them whilst you are taking xaluprine. xaluprine with food and drink xaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach. however, the choice of method should be consistent from day to day. do not take xaluprine at the same time as milk or dairy products, as they can make the medicine less effective. xaluprine should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after milk or dairy products. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility do not take xaluprine if you are planning to have a baby without first speaking to your doctor for advice. this applies to both men and women. xaluprine may harm your sperm or eggs. reliable contraception must be used to avoid pregnancy whilst you or your partner are taking xaluprine. both men and women should continue to use effective contraception for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. if you are already pregnant, you must talk to your doctor before taking xaluprine. xaluprine should not be handled by women who are or planning to be pregnant or breast-feeding. do not breast-feed while taking xaluprine. ask your doctor, pharmacist or midwife for advice. driving and using machines it is not expected that xaluprine will affect your ability to drive or use machines but no studies have been done to confirm this. xaluprine contains aspartame, sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (e219), sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate (e215) and sucrose this medicine contains 3 mg aspartame (e951) in each 1 ml. aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. it may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (pku), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. xaluprine also contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (e219) and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate (e215) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). xaluprine contains sucrose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. may be harmful to the teeth.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "xaluprine",

"Section_Content": "xaluprine should only be given to you by a specialist doctor who is experienced in treating blood problems. - when you take xaluprine your doctor will take regular blood tests. this is to check the number and type of cells in your blood and to ensure your liver is working correctly. - your doctor may also ask for other blood and urine tests to monitor your uric acid levels. uric acid is a natural body chemical, levels of which can rise while taking xaluprine. - your doctor may sometimes change your dose of xaluprine as a result of these tests. always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the usual starting dose for adults, adolescents and children is between 25-75 mg/m2 body surface area each day. your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. sometimes the doctor may change your dose of xaluprine for example as a result of different tests. if you are not sure how much medicine to take, always ask your doctor or nurse. it is important to take xaluprine in the evening to make the medicine more effective. you can take your medicine with food or on an empty stomach but the choice of method should be consistent from day to day. you should take your medicine at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after having milk or dairy products. your pack of xaluprine contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes (a purple 1 ml syringe and a white 5 ml syringe). always use the syringes provided to take your medicine. it is important that you use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. your doctor or pharmacist will advise which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed. the smaller 1 ml syringe (purple), marked from 0.1 ml to 1 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or equal to 1 ml. you should use this one if the total amount you have to take is less than or equal to 1 ml (each graduation of 0.1 ml contains 2 mg of mercaptopurine). the larger 5 ml syringe (white), marked 1 ml to 5 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 1 ml. you should use this one if the total amount you have to take is more than 1 ml (each graduation of 0.2 ml contains 4 mg of mercaptopurine). if you are a parent or care giver administering the medicine, wash your hands before and after administering a dose. wipe up spillages immediately. to decrease the risk of exposure disposable gloves should be used when handling xaluprine. if xaluprine comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. when you use the medicine follow the instructions below: 1. put on disposable hand gloves before handling xaluprine. 2. shake the bottle vigorously for at least 30 seconds to ensure the medicine is well mixed (figure 1). 3. remove the bottle cap (figure 2) and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle and leave in place for future doses (figure 3). 4. push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor (figure 4). your doctor or pharmacist will advise you of the correct syringe to use, either the 1 ml (purple syringe) or the 5 ml (white syringe) in order to give the correct dose. 5. turn the bottle upside down (figure 5). 6. pull the plunger of the syringe back so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the syringe. pull the plunger back to the point on the scale that corresponds to the dose prescribed (figure 5). if you are not sure about how much medicine to draw into the syringe, always ask your doctor or nurse for advice. 7. turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, holding it by the barrel rather than the plunger. 8. gently put the tip of the syringe into your mouth and to the inside of your cheek. 9. slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of your cheek and swallow it. do not forcefully push down the plunger, or squirt the medicine to the back of your mouth or throat, as you may choke. 10. remove the syringe from your mouth. 11. swallow the dose of oral suspension then drink some water, making sure no medicine is left in your mouth. 12. put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place. ensure that the cap is tightly closed. 13. wash the syringe with warm water and rinse well. hold the syringe under water and move the plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the syringe is clean. let the syringe air dry completely before you use that syringe again for dosing. do not wipe dry. store the syringe in a hygienic place with the medicine. repeat the above for each dose as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. if you take more xaluprine than you should if you take more xaluprine than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital immediately. you may feel sick, vomit or have diarrhoea. take the medicine pack and this leaflet with you. if you forget to take xaluprine tell your doctor. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop taking xaluprine do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to or you may get a relapse of your condition. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "xaluprine", "Type":
