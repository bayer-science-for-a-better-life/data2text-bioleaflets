When used in combination with pembrolizumab, \ndose escalation of axitinib above the initial 5 mg dose may be considered at intervals of six weeks or \nlonger (see section 5.1).\n\nFor liver enzyme elevations, in patients with RCC being treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with \naxitinib:\n If ALT or AST ≥ 3 times ULN but < 10 times ULN without concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 times \n\nULN, both KEYTRUDA and axitinib should be withheld until these adverse reactions recover to \nGrades 0-1. Corticosteroid therapy may be considered. Rechallenge with a single medicine or \nsequential rechallenge with both medicines after recovery may be considered. If rechallenging \nwith axitinib, dose reduction as per the axitinib SmPC may be considered.\n\n If ALT or AST ≥ 10 times ULN or > 3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 times \nULN, both KEYTRUDA and axitinib should be permanently discontinued and corticosteroid \ntherapy may be considered. \n\nPatients treated with KEYTRUDA must be given the patient alert card and be informed about the risks \nof KEYTRUDA (see also package leaflet).\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years (see section 5.1). Data from patients ≥ 65 years \nare too limited to draw conclusions on cHL population (see section 5.1). Data from pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy in patients with resected Stage III melanoma, from pembrolizumab in combination with \naxitinib in patients with advanced RCC, from chemotherapy combination in patients with metastatic \nNSCLC, and from pembrolizumab (with or without chemotherapy) in patients receiving first-line \ntreatment for metastatic or unresectable recurrent HNSCC ≥ 75 years are limited (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. KEYTRUDA has \nnot been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment. KEYTRUDA has not been \nstudied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in children below 18 years of age have not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nMethod of administration\nKEYTRUDA is for intravenous use. It must be administered by infusion over 30 minutes.\nKEYTRUDA must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.\n\nFor use in combination, see the SmPC for the concomitant therapies. When administering \nKEYTRUDA as part of a combination with intravenous chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be \nadministered first. \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAssessment of PD-L1 status\nWhen assessing the PD-L1 status of the tumour, it is important that a well-validated and robust \nmethodology is chosen to minimise false negative or false positive determinations.\n\nImmune-related adverse reactions\nImmune-related adverse reactions, including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients receiving \npembrolizumab. Most immune-related adverse reactions occurring during treatment with \npembrolizumab were reversible and managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of \ncorticosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune-related adverse reactions have also occurred after the \nlast dose of pembrolizumab. Immune-related adverse reactions affecting more than one body system \ncan occur simultaneously.\n\nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude \nother causes should be ensured. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should \nbe withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid taper \nshould be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in \npatients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, \nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered.\n\nPembrolizumab may be restarted within 12 weeks after last dose of KEYTRUDA if the adverse \nreaction recovers to Grade ≤ 1 and corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or \nequivalent per day.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nPembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse reaction \nthat recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-related adverse reaction toxicity, except for endocrinopathies \nthat are controlled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nImmune-related pneumonitis\nPneumonitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should \nbe monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed \nwith radiographic imaging and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids should be administered for \nGrade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper); \npembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 pneumonitis, and permanently discontinued for \nGrade 3, Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis (see section 4.2).\n\nImmune-related colitis\nColitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of colitis, and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids should be \nadministered for Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by \na taper); pembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or Grade 3 colitis, and permanently \ndiscontinued for Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 colitis (see section 4.2). The potential risk of \ngastrointestinal perforation should be taken into consideration.\n\nImmune-related hepatitis\nHepatitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for changes in liver function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment and as \nindicated based on clinical evaluation) and symptoms of hepatitis, and other causes excluded. \nCorticosteroids should be administered (initial dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg/day (for Grade 2 events) and \n1-2 mg/kg/day (for Grade ≥ 3 events) prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) and, based on \nseverity of liver enzyme elevations, pembrolizumab should be withheld or discontinued (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nImmune-related nephritis\nNephritis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for changes in renal function, and other causes of renal dysfunction excluded.\nCorticosteroids should be administered for Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone \nor equivalent followed by a taper) and, based on severity of creatinine elevations, pembrolizumab \nshould be withheld for Grade 2, and permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 nephritis (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nImmune-related endocrinopathies\nSevere endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, \ndiabetic ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism have been observed with pembrolizumab \ntreatment.\n\nLong-term hormone replacement therapy may be necessary in cases of immune-related \nendocrinopathies.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab.\nHypophysitis has also been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab. (See section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis (including \nhypopituitarism) and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids to treat adrenal insufficiency and other \nhormone replacement should be administered as clinically indicated. Pembrolizumab should be \nwithheld for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or symptomatic hypophysitis until the event is controlled \nwith hormone replacement. Pembrolizumab should be withheld or discontinued for Grades 3 or 4 \nadrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Continuation of pembrolizumab may be considered, after \ncorticosteroid taper, if needed (see section 4.2). Pituitary function and hormone levels should be \nmonitored to ensure appropriate hormone replacement.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been reported in patients receiving \npembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia or other signs and \nsymptoms of diabetes. Insulin should be administered for type 1 diabetes, and pembrolizumab should \nbe withheld in cases of type 1 diabetes associated with Grade ≥ 3 hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis until \nmetabolic control is achieved (see section 4.2).\n\nThyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis, have been reported in \npatients receiving pembrolizumab and can occur at any time during treatment. Hypothyroidism is \nmore frequently reported in patients with HNSCC with prior radiation therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment and \nas indicated based on clinical evaluation) and clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. \nHypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy without treatment interruption and \nwithout corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism may be managed symptomatically. Pembrolizumab should \nbe withheld for Grade ≥ 3 until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function and hormone \nlevels should be monitored to ensure appropriate hormone replacement.\n\nFor patients with Grade 3 or Grade 4 endocrinopathies that improved to Grade 2 or lower and are\ncontrolled with hormone replacement, if indicated, continuation of pembrolizumab may be considered \nafter corticosteroid taper, if needed. Otherwise treatment should be discontinued (see sections 4.2 and\n4.8). \n\nImmune-related skin adverse reactions \nImmune-related severe skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for suspected severe skin reactions and other causes should \nbe excluded. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should be withheld for \nGrade 3 skin reactions until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or permanently discontinued for Grade 4 skin \nreactions, and corticosteroids should be administered (see section 4.2).\n\nCases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported\nin patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). For suspected SJS or TEN, pembrolizumab \nshould be withheld and the patient should be referred to a specialised unit for assessment and \ntreatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nCaution should be used when considering the use of pembrolizumab in a patient who has previously \nexperienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other \nimmune-stimulatory anti-cancer agents.\n\nOther immune-related adverse reactions\nThe following additional clinically significant, immune-related adverse reactions have been reported \nin clinical studies or in post-marketing experience: uveitis, arthritis, myositis, myocarditis, \npancreatitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, haemolytic anaemia, sarcoidosis, \nencephalitis and myelitis (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nBased on the severity and type of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 \nor Grade 3 events and corticosteroids administered.\n\nPembrolizumab may be restarted within 12 weeks after last dose of KEYTRUDA if the adverse \nreaction recovers to Grade ≤ 1 and corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or \nequivalent per day. \n\nPembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse reaction \nthat recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-related adverse reaction.\n\nFor Grades 3 or 4 myocarditis, encephalitis or Guillain-Barré syndrome, pembrolizumab should be \npermanently discontinued (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nTransplant-related adverse reactions\n\nSolid organ transplant rejection\nSolid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with \nPD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with pembrolizumab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ \ntransplant recipients. The benefit of treatment with pembrolizumab versus the risk of possible organ \nrejection should be considered in these patients.\n\nComplications of allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT)\n\nAllogeneic HSCT after treatment with pembrolizumab\nCases of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) have been \nobserved in patients with cHL undergoing allogeneic HSCT after previous exposure to \npembrolizumab. Until further data become available, careful consideration to the potential benefits of \nHSCT and the possible increased risk of transplant-related complications should be made case by case \n(see section 4.8).\n\nAllogeneic HSCT prior to treatment with pembrolizumab\nIn patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD, including fatal GVHD, has been reported \nafter treatment with pembrolizumab. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure \nmay be at an increased risk for GVHD after treatment with pembrolizumab. Consider the benefit of \ntreatment with pembrolizumab versus the risk of possible GVHD in patients with a history of \nallogeneic HSCT.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nSevere infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been reported in \npatients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). For Grades 3 or 4 infusion reactions, infusion \nshould be stopped and pembrolizumab permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). Patients with \nGrades 1 or 2 infusion reaction may continue to receive pembrolizumab with close monitoring; \npremedication with antipyretic and antihistamine may be considered.\n\nDisease-specific precautions\n\nUse of pembrolizumab in urothelial carcinoma patients who have received prior platinum-containing \nchemotherapy\nPhysicians should consider the delayed onset of pembrolizumab effect before initiating treatment in \npatients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease. In urothelial carcinoma, a higher \nnumber of deaths within 2 months was observed in pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy (see \nsection 5.1). Factors associated with early deaths were fast progressive disease on prior platinum \ntherapy and liver metastases.\n\nUse of pembrolizumab in urothelial carcinoma for patients who are considered ineligible for \ncisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD-L1 with CPS ≥ 10\nThe baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the study population of KEYNOTE-052 \nincluded a proportion of patients eligible for a carboplatin-based combination, for whom the benefit is \nbeing assessed in a comparative study, and patients eligible for mono-chemotherapy, for whom no \nrandomised data are available. In addition, no safety and efficacy data are available in frailer patients \n(e.g. ECOG performance status 3) considered not eligible for chemotherapy. In the absence of these \ndata, pembrolizumab should be used with caution in this population after careful consideration of the \npotential risk-benefit on an individual basis.\n\nUse of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC\nIn general, the frequency of adverse reactions for pembrolizumab combination therapy is observed to \nbe higher than for pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy alone, reflecting the contributions of\neach of these components (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). A direct comparison of pembrolizumab when \nused in combination with chemotherapy to pembrolizumab monotherapy is not available.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nPhysicians should consider the benefit/risk balance of the available treatment options (pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy) before initiating treatment in \npreviously untreated patients with NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1. \n\nIn KEYNOTE-042, a higher number of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation followed by a \nlong-term survival benefit was observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to \nchemotherapy (see section 5.1).\n\nEfficacy and safety data from patients ≥ 75 years are limited. For patients ≥ 75 years, pembrolizumab \ncombination therapy should be used with caution after careful consideration of the potential \nbenefit/risk on an individual basis (see section 5.1).\n\nUse of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with HNSCC\nIn general, the frequency of adverse reactions for pembrolizumab combination therapy is observed to \nbe higher than for pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy alone, reflecting the contributions of \neach of these components (see section 4.8). \n\nPhysicians should consider the benefit/risk balance of the available treatment options (pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy) before initiating treatment in \npatients with HNSCC whose tumours express PD-L1 (see section 5.1).\n\nUse of pembrolizumab for adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma\nA trend toward increased frequency of severe and serious adverse reactions in patients ≥ 75 years was \nobserved. Safety data of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant melanoma setting in patients ≥ 75 years are \nlimited.\n\nUse of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib for first-line treatment of patients with RCC\nWhen pembrolizumab is given with axitinib, higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT \nand AST elevations have been reported in patients with advanced RCC (see section 4.8). Liver \nenzymes should be monitored before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. More \nfrequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the medicines are used in monotherapy \nmay be considered. Medical management guidelines for both medicines should be followed (see \nsection 4.2 and refer to the SmPC for axitinib). \n\nPatients excluded from clinical studies\nPatients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical studies: active CNS metastases; \nECOG PS ≥ 2 (except for urothelial carcinoma and RCC); HIV infection, hepatitis B or hepatitis C \ninfection; active systemic autoimmune disease; interstitial lung disease; prior pneumonitis requiring \nsystemic corticosteroid therapy; a history of severe hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody; \nreceiving immunosuppressive therapy and a history of severe immune-related adverse reactions from \ntreatment with ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid \ntreatment (> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for greater than 12 weeks. Patients with active \ninfections were excluded from clinical studies and were required to have their infection treated prior to \nreceiving pembrolizumab. Patients with active infections occurring during treatment with \npembrolizumab were managed with appropriate medical therapy. Patients with clinically significant \nrenal (creatinine > 1.5 x ULN) or hepatic (bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, ALT, AST > 2.5 x ULN in the \nabsence of liver metastases) abnormalities at baseline were excluded from clinical studies, therefore \ninformation is limited in patients with severe renal and moderate to severe hepatic impairment.\n\nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in patients with ocular melanoma \n(see section 5.1).\n\nFor subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL, clinical data for the use of pembrolizumab in patients \nineligible to ASCT due to reasons other than failure to salvage chemotherapy are limited (see\nsection 5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nAfter careful consideration of the potential increased risk, pembrolizumab may be used with \nappropriate medical management in these patients. \n\nPatient alert card\nAll prescribers of KEYTRUDA must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management \nGuidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of KEYTRUDA therapy with the patient. The patient \nwill be provided with the patient alert card with each prescription.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with pembrolizumab. Since \npembrolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug \ninteractions are expected. \n\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting pembrolizumab should be \navoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of \npembrolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after \nstarting pembrolizumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Corticosteroids \ncan also be used as premedication, when pembrolizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy, \nas antiemetic prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy-related adverse reactions.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with \npembrolizumab and for at least 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data on the use of pembrolizumab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have \nnot been conducted with pembrolizumab; however, in murine models of pregnancy blockade of PD-L1 \nsignalling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to result in an increased foetal loss\n(see section 5.3). These results indicate a potential risk, based on its mechanism of action, that \nadministration of pembrolizumab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, including increased rates \nof abortion or stillbirth. Human immunoglobulins G4 (IgG4) are known to cross the placental barrier; \ntherefore, being an IgG4, pembrolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the \ndeveloping foetus. Pembrolizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition \nof the woman requires treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether pembrolizumab is secreted in human milk. Since it is known that antibodies can \nbe secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision should be \nmade whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue pembrolizumab, taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of pembrolizumab therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nNo clinical data are available on the possible effects of pembrolizumab on fertility. There were no \nnotable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in monkeys based on 1-month and 6-month \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPembrolizumab has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In some patients, \ndizziness and fatigue have been reported following administration of pembrolizumab (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nPembrolizumab is most commonly associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these, \nincluding severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal \nof pembrolizumab (see “Description of selected adverse reactions” below).\n\nThe safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy has been evaluated in 5,884 patients with advanced \nmelanoma, resected Stage III melanoma (adjuvant therapy), NSCLC, cHL, urothelial carcinoma, or \nHNSCC across four doses (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or \n3 weeks) in clinical studies. The frequencies included below and in Table 2 are based on all reported \nadverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality. In this patient \npopulation, the median observation time was 7.3 months (range: 1 day to 31 months) and the most \nfrequent adverse reactions with pembrolizumab were fatigue (32%), nausea (20%), and \ndiarrhoea (20%). The majority of adverse reactions reported for monotherapy were of Grades 1 or 2 \nseverity. The most serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions and severe \ninfusion-related reactions (see section 4.4).\n\nThe safety of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy has been evaluated in 1,067 patients \nwith NSCLC or HNSCC receiving 200 mg, 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, in \nclinical studies. The frequencies included below and in Table 2 are based on all reported adverse drug \nreactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality. In this patient population, the most \nfrequent adverse reactions were anaemia (50%), nausea (50%), fatigue (37%), constipation (35%), \ndiarrhoea (30%), neutropaenia (30%), decreased appetite (28%) and vomiting (25%). Incidences of \nGrades 3-5 adverse reactions in patients with NSCLC were 67% for pembrolizumab combination \ntherapy and 66% for chemotherapy alone and in patients with HNSCC were 85% for pembrolizumab \ncombination therapy and 84% for chemotherapy plus cetuximab.\n\nThe safety of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib has been evaluated in a clinical study of \n429 patients with advanced RCC receiving 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and 5 mg axitinib \ntwice daily. In this patient population, the most frequent adverse reactions were diarrhoea (54%), \nhypertension (45%), fatigue (38%), hypothyroidism (35%), decreased appetite (30%), palmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia syndrome (28%), nausea (28%), ALT increased (27%), AST increased (26%), \ndysphonia (25%), cough (21%), and constipation (21%). Incidences of Grades 3-5 adverse reactions \nwere 76% for pembrolizumab combination therapy and 71% for sunitinib alone.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies of pembrolizumab as monotherapy or in combination \nwith chemotherapy or other anti-tumour medicines or reported from post-marketing use of \npembrolizumab are listed in Table 2. Adverse reactions known to occur with pembrolizumab or \nchemotherapies given alone may occur during treatment with these medicinal products in \ncombination, even if these reactions were not reported in clinical studies with combination therapy. \nThese reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of \ndecreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions in patients treated with pembrolizumab*\n\nMonotherapy

The management guidelines for these adverse \nreactions are described in section 4.4.\n\nImmune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4)\n\nImmune-related pneumonitis\nPneumonitis occurred in 253 (4.3%) patients, including Grade 2, 3, 4 or 5 cases in 106 (1.8%), \n69 (1.2%), 13 (0.2%) and 9 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time \nto onset of pneumonitis was 3.3 months (range 2 days to 26.8 months). The median duration was \n1.9 months (range 1 day to 25.3+ months). Pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients with a \nhistory of prior thoracic radiation (8.1%) than in patients who did not receive prior thoracic radiation \n(3.4%). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 98 (1.7%) patients. Pneumonitis \nresolved in 138 patients, 2 with sequelae.\n\nIn patients with NSCLC, pneumonitis occurred in 160 (5.7%), including Grade 2, 3, 4 or 5 cases in 62 \n(2.2%), 47 (1.7%), 14 (0.5%) and 10 (0.4%), respectively. In patients with NSCLC, pneumonitis \noccurred in 8.9% with a history of prior thoracic radiation.\n\nImmune-related colitis\nColitis occurred in 107 (1.8%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 31 (0.5%), 62 (1.1%) and \n3 (< 0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab.

The median time to onset of hepatitis was \n3.6 months (range 8 days to 21.4 months). The median duration was 1.1 months (range 1 day to \n20.9+ months). Hepatitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 19 (0.3%) patients. Hepatitis \nresolved in 36 patients.\n\nImmune-related nephritis \nNephritis occurred in 22 (0.4%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 5 (0.1%), 14 (0.2%) and \n1 (< 0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab as monotherapy. The median time to onset \nof nephritis was 5.0 months (range 12 days to 21.4 months). The median duration was 2.6 months \n(range 6 days to 12.0 months). Nephritis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 10 (0.2%) \npatients. Nephritis resolved in 13 patients, 3 with sequelae. In patients with non-squamous NSCLC \ntreated with pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy (n=488), the \nincidence of nephritis was 1.4% (all Grades) with 0.8% Grade 3 and 0.4% Grade 4.\n\nImmune-related endocrinopathies\nAdrenal insufficiency occurred in 46 (0.8%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 19 (0.3%), \n20 (0.3%) and 3 (0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of \nadrenal insufficiency was 5.4 months (range 1 day to 17.7 months). The median duration was not \nreached (range 3 days to 26.2+ months).

The median time to onset of \nhypothyroidism was 3.5 months (range 1 day to 19.6 months). The median duration was not reached \n(range 2 days to 32.6+ months). Two patients (< 0.1%) discontinued pembrolizumab due to \nhypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism resolved in 153 (23.7%) patients, 10 with sequelae. In patients with \ncHL (n=241) the incidence of hypothyroidism was 14.1% (all Grades) with 0.4% Grade 3. In patients \nwith HNSCC treated with pembrolizumab as monotherapy (n=909), the incidence of hypothyroidism \nwas 16.1% (all Grades) with 0.3% Grade 3. In patients with HNSCC treated with pembrolizumab in \ncombination with platinum and 5-FU chemotherapy (n=276), the incidence of hypothyroidism \nwas 15.2%, all of which were Grade 1 or 2.\n\nImmune-related skin adverse reactions\nImmune-related severe skin reactions occurred in 89 (1.5%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 5 cases \nin 10 (0.2%), 65 (1.1%) and 1 (< 0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median \ntime to onset of severe skin reactions was 3.3 months (range 3 days to 19.4 months). The median \nduration was 1.6 months (range 1 day to 27.3+ months). Severe skin reactions led to discontinuation of \npembrolizumab in 9 (0.2%) patients. Severe skin reactions resolved in 64 patients.\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nRare cases of SJS and TEN, some of them with fatal outcome, have been observed (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4).\n\nComplications of allogeneic HSCT in cHL\nOf 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with pembrolizumab, \n6 patients (26%) developed GVHD, one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe \nhepatic VOD after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. The 23 patients had a \nmedian follow-up from subsequent allogeneic HSCT of 5.1 months (range: 0-26.2 months).\n\nElevated liver enzymes when pembrolizumab is combined with axitinib in RCC\nIn a clinical study of previously untreated patients with RCC receiving pembrolizumab in combination \nwith axitinib, a higher than expected incidence of Grades 3 and 4 ALT increased (20%) and AST \nincreased (13%) were observed. The median time to onset of ALT increased was 2.3 months (range: \n7 days to 19.8 months). In patients with ALT ≥ 3 times ULN (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to \nGrades 0-1 in 94%. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic \ncorticosteroids. Of the patients who recovered, 92 (84%) were rechallenged with either \npembrolizumab (3%) or axitinib (31%) monotherapy or with both (50%). Of these patients, 55% had \nno recurrence of ALT > 3 times ULN, and of those patients with recurrence of ALT > 3 times ULN, \nall recovered. There were no Grade 5 hepatic events. \n\nLaboratory abnormalities \nIn patients treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, the proportion of patients who experienced a \nshift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 10.9% for lymphocytes \ndecreased, 8.2% for sodium decreased, 6.3% for haemoglobin decreased, 5.2% for phosphate \ndecreased, 4.8% for glucose increased, 2.8% for AST increased, 2.7% for alkaline phosphatase \nincreased, 2.7% for ALT increased, 2.2% for potassium decreased, 1.8% for calcium increased, 1.8% \nfor neutrophils decreased, 1.8% for potassium increased, 1.7% for bilirubin increased, 1.7% for \nplatelets decreased, 1.6% for albumin decreased, 1.5% for calcium decreased, 1.3% for creatinine \nincreased, 0.8% for leucocytes decreased, 0.7% for magnesium increased, 0.6% for glucose decreased, \n0.2% for magnesium decreased, and 0.2% for sodium increased.\n\nIn patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, the proportion of patients \nwho experienced a shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 26.7% \nfor neutrophils decreased, 23.9% for lymphocytes decreased, 19.1% for haemoglobin decreased, \n17.9% for leucocytes decreased, 12.2% for platelets decreased, 10.2% for sodium decreased, 8.9% for \nphosphate decreased, 7.4% for glucose increased, 6.5% for potassium decreased, 3.3 for creatinine \nincreased, 3.1% for ALT increased, 3.1% for AST increased, 3.1% for calcium decreased, 3.0% for \npotassium increased, 2.9% for albumin decreased, 2.3% for calcium increased, 1.2% for alkaline \nphosphatase increased, 0.8% for glucose decreased, 0.7% for bilirubin increased, and 0.3% for sodium \nincreased.\n\nIn patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib, the proportion of patients who \nexperienced a shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 20.1% for \nALT increased, 13.2% for AST increased, 10.8% for lymphocytes decreased, 8.9% for glucose \nincreased, 7.8% for sodium decreased, 6.4% for phosphate decreased, 6.2% for potassium increased, \n4.3% for creatinine increased, 3.6% for potassium decreased, 2.1% for bilirubin increased, 2.1% for \nhaemoglobin decreased, 1.7% for alkaline phosphatase increased, 1.5% for prothrombin INR \nincreased, 1.4% for leukocytes decreased, 1.4% for platelets decreased, 1.2% for activated partial \nthromboplastin time prolonged, 1.2% for neutrophils decreased, 1.2% for sodium increased, 0.7% for \ncalcium decreased, 0.7% for calcium increased, 0.5% for albumin decreased, and 0.2% for glucose \ndecreased.\n\nImmunogenicity\nIn clinical studies in patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every three weeks, 200 mg every \nthree weeks, or 10 mg/kg every two or three weeks as monotherapy, 36 (1.8%) of 2,034 evaluable\npatients tested positive for treatment-emergent antibodies to pembrolizumab, of which 9 (0.4%) \npatients had neutralising antibodies against pembrolizumab. There was no evidence of an altered \n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\npharmacokinetic or safety profile with anti-pembrolizumab binding or neutralising antibody \ndevelopment.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy has been evaluated in 154 paediatric patients with \nadvanced melanoma, lymphoma, or PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumours at\n2 mg/kg every 3 weeks in the Phase I/II study KEYNOTE-051. The safety profile in these paediatric \npatients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab. The most common \nadverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of paediatric patients) were pyrexia (31%), \nvomiting (26%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), anaemia (21%) and constipation (20%). The \nmajority of adverse reactions reported for monotherapy were of Grades 1 or 2 severity. \nSixty-nine (44.8%) patients had 1 or more Grades 3 to 5 adverse reactions of which 6 (3.9%) patients\nhad 1 or more adverse reactions that resulted in death. The frequencies are based on all reported \nadverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no information on overdose with pembrolizumab. \n\nIn case of overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions,\nand appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC18\n\nMechanism of action\nKEYTRUDA is a humanised monoclonal antibody which binds to the programmed cell death-1 \n(PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a \nnegative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell \nimmune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, \nthrough blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting \ncells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nPembrolizumab doses of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 10 mg/kg every \n2 weeks were evaluated in melanoma or previously treated NSCLC clinical studies. Based on the \nmodelling and simulation of dose/exposure relationships for efficacy and safety for pembrolizumab, \nthere are no clinically significant differences in efficacy or safety among the doses of 200 mg every \n3 weeks, 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 400 mg every 6 weeks as monotherapy (see section 4.2).\n\nMelanoma\nKEYNOTE-006: Controlled study in melanoma patients naïve to treatment with ipilimumab\nThe safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-006, a multicentre, \nopen-label, controlled, Phase III study for the treatment of advanced melanoma in patients who were \nnaïve to ipilimumab. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 \n(n=279) or 3 weeks (n=277) or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=278). Patients with BRAF \nV600E mutant melanoma were not required to have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20\n\nPatients were treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nClinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression were permitted to remain on \ntreatment until disease progression was confirmed. Assessment of tumour status was performed at \n12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. \n\nOf the 834 patients, 60% were male, 44% were ≥ 65 years (median age was 62 years [range 18-89]) \nand 98% were white. Sixty-five percent of patients had M1c stage, 9% had a history of brain \nmetastases, 66% had no and 34% had one prior therapy. Thirty-one percent had an ECOG \nPerformance Status of 1, 69% had ECOG Performance Status of 0 and 32% had elevated LDH. BRAF \nmutations were reported in 302 (36%) patients. Among patients with BRAF mutant tumours, \n139 (46%) were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were progression free survival (PFS; as assessed by \nIntegrated Radiology and Oncology Assessment [IRO] review using Response Evaluation Criteria in \nSolid Tumours [RECIST], version 1.1) and overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy outcome \nmeasures were objective response rate (ORR) and response duration.

Patients were \nrandomised (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 (n=180) or 10 mg/kg (n=181) every \n3 weeks or chemotherapy (n=179; including dacarbazine, temozolomide, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or \ncarboplatin+paclitaxel). The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease or those receiving \nimmunosuppression; further exclusion criteria were a history of severe or life-threatening \nimmune-related adverse reactions from treatment with ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or \nGrade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for \ngreater than 12 weeks; ongoing adverse reactions ≥ Grade 2 from previous treatment with ipilimumab; \nprevious severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies; a history of pneumonitis or interstitial \nlung disease; HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection and ECOG Performance Status ≥ 2. \n\nPatients were treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nClinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression were permitted to remain on \ntreatment until disease progression was confirmed. Assessment of tumour status was performed at \n12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients on \nchemotherapy who experienced independently-verified progression of disease after the first scheduled \ndisease assessment were able to crossover and receive 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of pembrolizumab every \n3 weeks in a double-blind fashion.\n\nOf the 540 patients, 61% were male, 43% were ≥ 65 years (median age was 62 years [range 15-89]) \nand 98% were white. Eighty-two percent had M1c stage, 73% had at least two and 32% of patients had \nthree or more prior systemic therapies for advanced melanoma. Forty-five percent had an ECOG \nPerformance Status of 1, 40% had elevated LDH and 23% had a BRAF mutated tumour. \n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by IRO using RECIST version 1.1 and \nOS. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration. Table 4 summarises key \nefficacy measures at the final analysis in patients previously treated with ipilimumab, and the \nKaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 3. Both pembrolizumab arms were superior to \nchemotherapy for PFS, and there was no difference between pembrolizumab doses. There was no \nstatistically significant difference between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in the final OS analysis \nthat was not adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of crossover. Of the patients randomised \nto the chemotherapy arm, 55% crossed over and subsequently received treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nTable 4: Efficacy results in KEYNOTE-002\n\nEndpoint Pembrolizumab\n2 mg/kg every \n\n3 weeks\nn=180\n\nPembrolizumab\n10 mg/kg every \n\n3 weeks\nn=181\n\nChemotherapy\n\nn=179\nPFS\n\nNumber (%) \nof patients \nwith event\n\n150 (83%) 144 (80%) 172 (96%)\n\nHazard ratio* \n(95% CI)\n\n0.58 (0.46, 0.73) 0.47 (0.37, 0.60) ---\n\np-Value† < 0.001 < 0.001 ---\nMedian in \nmonths \n(95% CI)\n\n2.9 (2.8, 3.8) 3.0 (2.8, 5.2) 2.8 (2.6, 2.8)\n\nOS\nNumber (%) \nof patients \nwith event\n\n123 (68%) 117 (65%) 128 (72%)\n\nHazard ratio* \n(95% CI)\n\n0.86 (0.67, 1.10) 0.74 (0.57, 0.96) ---\n\np-Value† 0.1173 0.0106‡ ---\nMedian in \nmonths \n(95% CI)\n\n13.4 (11.0, 16.4) 14.7 (11.3, 19.5) 11.0 (8.9, 13.8)\n\nBest objective\nresponse\n\nORR % \n(95% CI)\n\n22% (16, 29) 28% (21, 35) 5% (2, 9)\n\nComplete \nresponse %\n\n3% 7% 0%\n\nPartial \nresponse %\n\n19% 20% 5%\n\nResponse \nduration§\n\nMedian in \nmonths \n(range)\n\n22.8 \n(1.4+, 25.3+)\n\nNot reached \n(1.1+, 28.3+)\n\n6.8\n(2.8, 11.3)\n\n% ongoing at \n12 months\n\n73% ¶ 79% ¶ 0% ¶\n\n* Hazard ratio (pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy) based on the stratified Cox \nproportional hazard model\n\n† Based on stratified log-rank test \n‡ Not statistically significant after adjustment for multiplicity\n§ Based on patients with a best objective response as confirmed complete or partial \n\nresponse from the final analysis\n¶ Based on Kaplan-Meier estimation\n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier curve for progression-free survival by treatment arm in \nKEYNOTE-002 (intent to treat population)\n\nKEYNOTE-001: Open-label study in melanoma patients naïve and previously treated with ipilimumab\nThe safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab for patients with advanced melanoma were investigated in \nan uncontrolled, open-label study, KEYNOTE-001. Efficacy was evaluated for 276 patients from two \ndefined cohorts, one which included patients previously treated with ipilimumab (and if BRAF V600 \nmutation-positive, with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor) and the other which included patients naïve to \ntreatment with ipilimumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of \n2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab until \ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease \nprogression were permitted to remain on treatment until disease progression was confirmed. Exclusion \ncriteria were similar to those of KEYNOTE-002.\n\nOf the 89 patients receiving 2 mg/kg of pembrolizumab who were previously treated with ipilimumab, \n53% were male, 33% were ≥ 65 years of age and the median age was 59 years (range 18-88). All but \ntwo patients were white. Eighty-four percent had M1c stage and 8% of patients had a history of brain \nmetastases. Seventy percent had at least two and 35% of patients had three or more prior systemic \ntherapies for advanced melanoma. BRAF mutations were reported in 13% of the study population. All \npatients with BRAF mutant tumours were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.\n\nOf the 51 patients receiving 2 mg/kg of pembrolizumab who were naïve to treatment with ipilimumab, \n63% were male, 35% were ≥ 65 years of age and the median age was 60 years (range 35-80). All but \none patient was white. Sixty-three percent had M1c stage and 2% of patients had a history of brain \nmetastases. Forty-five percent had no prior therapies for advanced melanoma. BRAF mutations were \nreported in 20 (39%) patients. Among patients with BRAF mutant tumours, 10 (50%) were previously \ntreated with a BRAF inhibitor.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by independent review using \nRECIST 1.1.

A total of 1,019 adult patients were randomised (1:1) to \nreceive pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks (n=514) or placebo (n=505), for up to one year \nuntil disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by American Joint \nCommittee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition stage (IIIA vs. IIIB vs. IIIC 1-3 positive lymph nodes vs. \nIIIC ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes) and geographic region (North America, European countries, Australia \nand other countries as designated). Patients must have undergone lymph node dissection, and if \nindicated, radiotherapy within 13 weeks prior to starting treatment. Patients with active autoimmune \ndisease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were \nineligible. Patients who received prior therapy for melanoma other than surgery or interferon for thick \nprimary melanomas without evidence of lymph node involvement were ineligible. Patients underwent \nimaging every 12 weeks after the first dose of pembrolizumab for the first two years, then every \n6 months from year 3 to 5, and then annually.\n\nAmong the 1,019 patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 54 years (25% age 65 or \nolder); 62% male; and ECOG PS of 0 (94%) and 1 (6%). Sixteen percent had stage IIIA; 46% had \nstage IIIB; 18% had stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes) and 20% had stage IIIC (≥ 4 positive lymph \nnodes); 50% were BRAF V600 mutation positive and 44% were BRAF wild-type. PD-L1 expression \n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nwas tested retrospectively by immunohistochemistry assay with the 22C3 anti-PD-L1 antibody; 84% \nof patients had PD-L1-positive melanoma (PD-L1 expression in ≥ 1% of tumour and \ntumour-associated immune cells relative to all viable tumour cells). The same scoring system was used \nfor metastatic melanoma (MEL score).\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS) in \nthe whole population and in the population with PD-L1 positive tumours, where RFS was defined as \nthe time between the date of randomisation and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant \nmetastasis) or death, whichever occurs first. The study demonstrated a statistically significant \nimprovement in RFS for patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo at the \npre-specified interim analysis. Efficacy results based on an additional seven months of follow-up are\nsummarised in Table 10 and Figure 4.\n\nTable 10: Efficacy results in KEYNOTE-054\n\nEndpoint KEYTRUDA\n200 mg every \n\n3 weeks\nn=514\n\nPlacebo\n\nn=505\nNumber (%) of patients with \nevent \n\n158 (31%) 246 (49%)\n\nMedian in months (95% CI) NR 21.7 (17.1, NR)\nHazard ratio* (98% CI) 0.56 (0.44, 0.72)\n\np-Value (stratified log-rank) < 0.0001\nRFS at 6 months\n\nRFS rate 82% 73%\nRFS at 12 months\n\nRFS rate 76% 61%\nRFS at 18 months\n\nRFS rate 72% 54%\n* Based on the stratified Cox proportional hazard model\n\nNR = not reached\n\nKEYNOTE-054 enrolled patients per AJCC 7th edition and a subgroup analysis of RFS per AJCC \n8th edition was performed after the RFS study results were reported.

Patients had \nPD-L1 expression with a ≥ 50% TPS based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. Patients were \nrandomised (1:1) to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=154) or \ninvestigator’s choice platinum-containing chemotherapy (n=151; including pemetrexed+carboplatin, \npemetrexed+cisplatin, gemcitabine+cisplatin, gemcitabine+carboplatin, or paclitaxel+carboplatin. \nPatients with non-squamous NSCLC could receive pemetrexed maintenance.). Patients were treated \nwith pembrolizumab until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Treatment could continue \nbeyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving \nclinical benefit by the investigator. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to \n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\n24 months. The study excluded patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations; autoimmune \ndisease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required \nimmunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior \n26 weeks. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 weeks. Patients on chemotherapy who \nexperienced independently-verified progression of disease were able to crossover and receive \npembrolizumab.\n\nAmong the 305 patients in KEYNOTE-024, baseline characteristics were: median age 65 years (54% \nage 65 or older); 61% male; 82% White, 15% Asian; and ECOG performance status 0 and 1 in 35% \nand 65%, respectively. Disease characteristics were squamous (18%) and non-squamous (82%); M1 \n(99%); and brain metastases (9%).\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review\n(BICR) using RECIST 1.1. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR (as assessed by \nBICR using RECIST 1.1). Table 12 summarises key efficacy measures for the entire intent to treat \n(ITT) population.

However, due to the exploratory \nnature of this subgroup analysis, no definitive conclusions can be drawn.\n\nKEYNOTE-189: Controlled study of combination therapy in non-squamous NSCLC patients naïve to \ntreatment\nThe efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy was \ninvestigated in a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind study, KEYNOTE-189. Key \neligibility criteria were metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, no prior systemic treatment for metastatic \nNSCLC, and no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations. Patients with autoimmune disease that \nrequired systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required \nimmunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior \n26 weeks were ineligible. Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive one of the following regimens:\n\n Pembrolizumab 200 mg with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and investigator’s choice of \ncisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks for \n4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously \nevery 3 weeks (n=410)\n\n Placebo with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and investigator’s choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or \ncarboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by \nplacebo and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n=206)\n\nTreatment with pembrolizumab continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease as \ndetermined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of \npembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression by BICR or beyond \ndiscontinuation of pemetrexed if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as \n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\ndetermined by the investigator. For patients who completed 24 months of therapy or had a complete \nresponse, treatment with pembrolizumab could be reinitiated for disease progression and administered \nfor up to 1 additional year. Assessment of tumour status was performed at Week 6 and Week 12, \nfollowed by every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo plus chemotherapy who experienced \nindependently-verified progression of disease were offered pembrolizumab as monotherapy.\n\nAmong the 616 patients in KEYNOTE-189, baseline characteristics were: median age of 64 years \n(49% age 65 or older); 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; 43% and 56% ECOG performance status \nof 0 or 1 respectively; 31% PD-L1 negative (TPS < 1%); and 18% with treated or untreated brain \nmetastases at baseline.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1). \nSecondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration, as assessed by BICR using \nRECIST 1.1.

Patients must have received first line platinum-containing regimen for locally \nadvanced/metastatic disease or as neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment, with recurrence/progression \n≤ 12 months following completion of therapy. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either \npembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=270) or investigator’s choice of any of the following\nchemotherapy regimens all given intravenously every 3 weeks (n=272): paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (n=84), \ndocetaxel 75 mg/m2 (n=84), or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 (n=87). Patients were treated with \npembrolizumab until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Treatment could continue beyond \nprogression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the \ninvestigator. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The study \nexcluded patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression and \n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\npatients with more than 2 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. \nPatients with an ECOG performance status of 2 had to have a haemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, could not have \nliver metastases, and must have received the last dose of their last prior chemotherapy regimen \n≥ 3 months prior to enrolment. Assessment of tumour status was performed at 9 weeks after the first \ndose, then every 6 weeks through the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. \n\nAmong the 542 randomised patients in KEYNOTE-045, baseline characteristics were: median age \n66 years (range: 26 to 88), 58% age 65 or older; 74% male; 72% White and 23% Asian; 56% ECOG \nperformance status of 1 and 1% ECOG performance status of 2; and 96% M1 disease and 4% \nM0 disease. Eighty-seven percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 34% with liver \nmetastases. Eighty-six percent had a primary tumour in the lower tract and 14% had a primary tumour \nin the upper tract. Fifteen percent of patients had disease progression following prior \nplatinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-one percent had received 2 prior \nsystemic regimens in the metastatic setting. Seventy-six percent of patients received prior cisplatin, \n23% had prior carboplatin, and 1% was treated with other platinum-based regimens.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcomes were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1. \nSecondary outcome measures were ORR (as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1) and duration of \nresponse. Table 20 summarises the key efficacy measures for the ITT population at the final analysis. \nThe Kaplan-Meier curve based on the final analysis for OS is shown in Figure 13. The study \ndemonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and ORR for patients randomised to \npembrolizumab as compared to chemotherapy.

Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to one of the following \ntreatment arms:\n\n Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks\n Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks or \n\ncisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, and 5-FU 1,000 mg/m2/d 4 days continuous every \n3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and 5-FU)\n\n Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 load then 250 mg/m2 once weekly, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min \nevery 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, and 5-FU 1,000 mg/m2/d 4 days \ncontinuous every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and 5-FU)\n\nTreatment with pembrolizumab continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease as \ndetermined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of \npembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was \nclinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of\ntumour status was performed at Week 9 and then every 6 weeks for the first year, followed by every \n9 weeks through 24 months. \n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nAmong the 882 patients in KEYNOTE-048, 754 (85%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with a \nCPS ≥ 1 based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of these \n754 patients included: median age of 61 years (range: 20 to 94); 36% age 65 or older; 82% male; 74% \nWhite and 19% Asian; 61% ECOG performance status of 1; and 77% former/current smokers. Disease \ncharacteristics were: 21% HPV positive and 95% had stage IV disease (stage IVa 21%, stage IVb 6%, \nand stage IVc 69%).\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (assessed by BICR according to \nRECIST 1.1). The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for all patients \nrandomised to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to standard treatment \n(HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60-0.87) and in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 randomised to \npembrolizumab monotherapy compared to standard treatment. Tables 24 and 25 summarise key \nefficacy results for pembrolizumab in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 in \nKEYNOTE-048 at the final analysis performed at a median follow-up of 13 months for \npembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and at a median follow-up of 11.5 months for \npembrolizumab monotherapy.

\nchemotherapy\nThe safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-040, a multicentre, \nopen-label, randomised, controlled study for the treatment of histologically confirmed recurrent or \nmetastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, pharynx or larynx in patients who had disease progression on or \nafter platinum-containing chemotherapy administered for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC or following \nplatinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy, \nand were not amenable to local therapy with curative intent. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 \nexpression (TPS ≥ 50%), HPV status and ECOG performance status and then randomised (1:1) to \nreceive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=247) or one of three standard treatments\n(n=248): methotrexate 40 mg/m2 once weekly (n=64), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks (n=99), \nor cetuximab 400 mg/m2 loading dose and then 250 mg/m2 once weekly (n=71). Treatment could \ncontinue beyond progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving \nclinical benefit by the investigator. The study excluded patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, active \nautoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment, a medical condition \nthat required immunosuppression, or who were previously treated with 3 or more systemic regimens \nfor recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. Assessment of tumour status was performed at 9 weeks, then\nevery 6 weeks through Week 52, followed by every 9 weeks through 24 months.\n\nAmong the 495 patients in KEYNOTE-040, 129 (26%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with a \nTPS ≥ 50% based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of these \n129 patients included: median age 62 years (40% age 65 or older); 81% male; 78% White, 11% Asian, \nand 2% Black; 23% and 77% with an ECOG performance status 0 or 1, respectively; and 19% with \nHPV positive tumours. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of patients had M1 disease and the majority had \nstage IV disease (stage IV 32%, stage IVa 14%, stage IVb 4%, and stage IVc 44%). Sixteen\npercent (16%) had disease progression following platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant \nchemotherapy, and 84% had received 1-2 prior systemic regimens for metastatic disease.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome was OS in the ITT population. The initial analysis resulted in a HR for \nOS of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.01) with a one-sided p-value of 0.0316. The median OS was 8.4 months \nfor pembrolizumab compared to 7.1 months for standard treatment. Table 28 summarises the key \nefficacy measures for the TPS ≥ 50% population.

At the time of this analysis, the hazard ratio in the overall population (95% CI)\nwas 0.59 (0.45, 0.78) with 84/432 (19.4%) events in the combination arm and 122/429 (28.4%) events \nin the sunitinib arm. The 12-month OS rate was 89.5% (95% CI 86.2, 92.1) for pembrolizumab in \ncombination with axitinib and 78.8% (95% CI 74.7, 82.4) for sunitinib. The 18-month OS rate was \n81.0% (95% CI 76.7, 84.6) for pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib and 70.7% (95% CI 65.8, \n75.1) for sunitinib. For the IMDC risk category, the OS hazard ratio for the favourable risk group was \n0.94 (95% CI 0.43, 2.07), for the intermediate risk group the OS hazard ratio was 0.52 (95% CI 0.36, \n0.75), and for the poor risk group the OS hazard ratio was 0.50 (95% CI 0.29, 0.87).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn KEYNOTE-051, 154 paediatric patients (60 children aged 6 months to less than 12 years and\n94 adolescents aged 12 years to 18 years) with advanced melanoma or PD-L1 positive advanced, \nrelapsed, or refractory solid tumours or lymphoma were administered pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every \n3 weeks. All patients received pembrolizumab for a median of 3 doses (range 1-35 doses), with \n130 patients (84.4%) receiving pembrolizumab for 2 doses or more. Participants were enrolled across \n28 tumour types by primary diagnosis. The most common tumour types by histology were Hodgkin \nlymphoma (11.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.1%), neuroblastoma (6.5%), osteosarcoma (6.5%) and \nmelanoma (5.2%). Of the 154 patients, 134 were enrolled with solid tumours, 18 with Hodgkin \nlymphoma, and 2 with other lymphomas. In patients with solid tumours and other lymphomas, the \nORR was 5.9%, no patient had a complete response and 8 patients (5.9%) had a partial response. In \nthe Hodgkin lymphoma population, the ORR was 50.0%, 2 patients (11.1%) had a complete response \nand 7 patients (38.9%) had a partial response.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \npembrolizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab was studied in 2,993 patients with metastatic or unresectable \nmelanoma, NSCLC, or carcinoma who received doses in the range of 1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, \n2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 200 mg every 3 weeks.\n\nAbsorption\nPembrolizumab is administered via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely \nbioavailable.\n\nDistribution\nConsistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at \nsteady-state is small (~6.0 L; CV: 20%). As expected for an antibody, pembrolizumab does not bind to \nplasma proteins in a specific manner.\n\n \n\n\n\n64\n\nBiotransformation\nPembrolizumab is catabolised through non-specific pathways; metabolism does not contribute to its \nclearance.\n\nElimination\nPembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after \nachieving maximal change at steady-state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); \nthis decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value \n(CV%) for the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nExposure to pembrolizumab as expressed by peak concentration (Cmax) or area under the plasma \nconcentration time curve (AUC) increased dose proportionally within the dose range for efficacy. \nSteady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with an \nevery 3 week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.1-fold. The median trough concentrations \n(Cmin) at steady-state were approximately 22 mcg/mL at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks and \n29 mcg/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. The median area under the concentration time curve at \nsteady-state over 3 weeks (AUC0-3weeks) was 794 mcg∙day/mL at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks and \n1,053 mcg∙day/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.\n\nFollowing administration of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks in patients with cHL, the observed \nmedian Cmin at steady-state was up to 40% higher than that in other tumour types treated with the same \ndosage; however, the range of trough concentrations is similar. There are no notable differences in \nmedian Cmax between cHL and other tumour types. Based on available safety data in cHL and other \ntumour types, these differences are not clinically meaningful.\n\nSpecial populations\nThe effects of various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab were assessed in \npopulation pharmacokinetic analyses. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the \nclearance of pembrolizumab: age (range 15-94 years), gender, race, mild or moderate renal \nimpairment, mild hepatic impairment and tumour burden. The relationship between body weight and \nclearance supports the use of either fixed dose or body weight-based dosing to provide adequate and \nsimilar control of exposure. Pembrolizumab concentrations with weight-based dosing at 2 mg/kg every \n3 weeks in paediatric patients (2 to 17 years) are comparable to those of adults at the same dose.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe effect of renal impairment on the clearance of pembrolizumab was evaluated by population \npharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients \nwith normal renal function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of pembrolizumab \nwere found between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal \nfunction. Pembrolizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nHepatic impairment\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of pembrolizumab was evaluated by population \npharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild hepatic impairment (as defined using the US National \nCancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No \nclinically important differences in the clearance of pembrolizumab were found between patients with \nmild hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. Pembrolizumab has not been studied in patients \nwith moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe safety of pembrolizumab was evaluated in a 1-month and a 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study in \nCynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous doses of 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg once a week in the \n1-month study and once every two weeks in the 6-month study, followed by a 4-month treatment-free \nperiod. No findings of toxicological significance were observed and the no observed adverse effect \nlevel (NOAEL) in both studies was ≥ 200 mg/kg, which produced exposure multiples of 19 and \n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\n94 times the exposure in humans at doses of 10 and 2 mg/kg, respectively. The exposure multiple \nbetween the NOAEL and a human dose of 200 mg was 74.\n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway \nis thought to be involved in maintaining tolerance to the foetus throughout pregnancy. Blockade of \nPD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and \nto result in an increase in foetal loss. \n\nAnimal fertility studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. In 1 month and 6 month \nrepeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male and female \nreproductive organs; however, many animals in these studies were not sexually mature.\n\n6.

When used in combination with pembrolizumab, \ndose escalation of axitinib above the initial 5 mg dose may be considered at intervals of six weeks or \nlonger (see section 5.1).\n\nFor liver enzyme elevations, in patients with RCC being treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with \naxitinib:\n If ALT or AST ≥ 3 times ULN but < 10 times ULN without concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 times \n\nULN, both KEYTRUDA and axitinib should be withheld until these adverse reactions recover to \nGrades 0-1. Corticosteroid therapy may be considered. Rechallenge with a single medicine or \nsequential rechallenge with both medicines after recovery may be considered. If rechallenging \nwith axitinib, dose reduction as per the axitinib SmPC may be considered.\n\n If ALT or AST ≥ 10 times ULN or > 3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 times \nULN, both KEYTRUDA and axitinib should be permanently discontinued and corticosteroid \ntherapy may be considered.\n\nPatients treated with KEYTRUDA must be given the patient alert card and be informed about the risks \nof KEYTRUDA (see also package leaflet).\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years (see section 5.1). Data from patients ≥ 65 years \nare too limited to draw conclusions on cHL population (see section 5.1). Data from pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy in patients with resected Stage III melanoma, from pembrolizumab in combination with \naxitinib in patients with advanced RCC, from chemotherapy combination in patients with metastatic \nNSCLC, and from pembrolizumab (with or without chemotherapy) in patients receiving first-line \ntreatment for metastatic or unresectable recurrent HNSCC ≥ 75 years are limited (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n72\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. KEYTRUDA has \nnot been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment. KEYTRUDA has not been \nstudied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in children below 18 years of age have not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nMethod of administration\nKEYTRUDA is for intravenous use. It must be administered by infusion over 30 minutes.\nKEYTRUDA must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.\n\nFor use in combination, see the SmPC for the concomitant therapies. When administering \nKEYTRUDA as part of a combination with intravenous chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be \nadministered first. \n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAssessment of PD-L1 status\nWhen assessing the PD-L1 status of the tumour, it is important that a well-validated and robust \nmethodology is chosen to minimise false negative or false positive determinations.\n\nImmune-related adverse reactions\nImmune-related adverse reactions, including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients receiving \npembrolizumab. Most immune-related adverse reactions occurring during treatment with \npembrolizumab were reversible and managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of \ncorticosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune-related adverse reactions have also occurred after the \nlast dose of pembrolizumab. Immune-related adverse reactions affecting more than one body system \ncan occur simultaneously.\n\nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude \nother causes should be ensured. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should \nbe withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid taper \nshould be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in \npatients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, \nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered.\n\nPembrolizumab may be restarted within 12 weeks after last dose of KEYTRUDA if the adverse \nreaction recovers to Grade ≤ 1 and corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or \nequivalent per day.\n\nPembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse reaction \nthat recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-related adverse reaction toxicity, except for endocrinopathies \nthat are controlled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n73\n\nImmune-related pneumonitis\nPneumonitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should \nbe monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed \nwith radiographic imaging and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids should be administered for \nGrade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper); \npembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 pneumonitis, and permanently discontinued for \nGrade 3, Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis (see section 4.2).\n\nImmune-related colitis\nColitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of colitis, and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids should be \nadministered for Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by \na taper); pembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or Grade 3 colitis, and permanently \ndiscontinued for Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 colitis (see section 4.2). The potential risk of \ngastrointestinal perforation should be taken into consideration.\n\nImmune-related hepatitis\nHepatitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for changes in liver function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment and as \nindicated based on clinical evaluation) and symptoms of hepatitis, and other causes excluded. \nCorticosteroids should be administered (initial dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg/day (for Grade 2 events) and \n1-2 mg/kg/day (for Grade ≥ 3 events) prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) and, based on \nseverity of liver enzyme elevations, pembrolizumab should be withheld or discontinued (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nImmune-related nephritis\nNephritis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for changes in renal function, and other causes of renal dysfunction excluded. \nCorticosteroids should be administered for Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone \nor equivalent followed by a taper) and, based on severity of creatinine elevations, pembrolizumab \nshould be withheld for Grade 2, and permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 nephritis (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nImmune-related endocrinopathies\nSevere endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, \ndiabetic ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism have been observed with pembrolizumab \ntreatment.\n\nLong-term hormone replacement therapy may be necessary in cases of immune-related \nendocrinopathies.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab.\nHypophysitis has also been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab. (See section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis (including \nhypopituitarism) and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids to treat adrenal insufficiency and other \nhormone replacement should be administered as clinically indicated. Pembrolizumab should be \nwithheld for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or symptomatic hypophysitis until the event is controlled \nwith hormone replacement. Pembrolizumab should be withheld or discontinued for Grades 3 or 4 \nadrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Continuation of pembrolizumab may be considered, after \ncorticosteroid taper, if needed (see section 4.2). Pituitary function and hormone levels should be \nmonitored to ensure appropriate hormone replacement.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been reported in patients receiving \npembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia or other signs and \nsymptoms of diabetes. Insulin should be administered for type 1 diabetes, and pembrolizumab should \n\n \n\n\n\n74\n\nbe withheld in cases of type 1 diabetes associated with Grade ≥ 3 hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis until \nmetabolic control is achieved (see section 4.2).\n\nThyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis, have been reported in \npatients receiving pembrolizumab and can occur at any time during treatment. Hypothyroidism is \nmore frequently reported in patients with HNSCC with prior radiation therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment and \nas indicated based on clinical evaluation) and clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. \nHypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy without treatment interruption and \nwithout corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism may be managed symptomatically. Pembrolizumab should \nbe withheld for Grade ≥ 3 until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function and hormone \nlevels should be monitored to ensure appropriate hormone replacement.\n\nFor patients with Grade 3 or Grade 4 endocrinopathies that improved to Grade 2 or lower and are\ncontrolled with hormone replacement, if indicated, continuation of pembrolizumab may be considered \nafter corticosteroid taper, if needed. Otherwise treatment should be discontinued (see sections 4.2 and \n4.8). \n\nImmune-related skin adverse reactions \nImmune-related severe skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for suspected severe skin reactions and other causes should \nbe excluded. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should be withheld for \nGrade 3 skin reactions until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or permanently discontinued for Grade 4 skin \nreactions, and corticosteroids should be administered (see section 4.2).\n\nCases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported\nin patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). For suspected SJS or TEN, pembrolizumab \nshould be withheld and the patient should be referred to a specialised unit for assessment and \ntreatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nCaution should be used when considering the use of pembrolizumab in a patient who has previously \nexperienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other \nimmune-stimulatory anti-cancer agents.\n\nOther immune-related adverse reactions\nThe following additional clinically significant, immune-related adverse reactions have been reported \nin clinical studies or in post-marketing experience: uveitis, arthritis, myositis, myocarditis, \npancreatitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, haemolytic anaemia, sarcoidosis, \nencephalitis and myelitis (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nBased on the severity and type of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 \nor Grade 3 events and corticosteroids administered.\n\nPembrolizumab may be restarted within 12 weeks after last dose of KEYTRUDA if the adverse \nreaction recovers to Grade ≤ 1 and corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or \nequivalent per day.\n\nPembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse reaction \nthat recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-related adverse reaction.\n\nFor Grades 3 or 4 myocarditis, encephalitis or Guillain-Barré syndrome, pembrolizumab should be \npermanently discontinued (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n75\n\nTransplant-related adverse reactions\n\nSolid organ transplant rejection\nSolid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with \nPD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with pembrolizumab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ \ntransplant recipients. The benefit of treatment with pembrolizumab versus the risk of possible organ \nrejection should be considered in these patients.\n\nComplications of allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT)\n\nAllogeneic HSCT after treatment with pembrolizumab\nCases of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) have been \nobserved in patients with cHL undergoing allogeneic HSCT after previous exposure to \npembrolizumab. Until further data become available, careful consideration to the potential benefits of \nHSCT and the possible increased risk of transplant-related complications should be made case by case \n(see section 4.8).\n\nAllogeneic HSCT prior to treatment with pembrolizumab\nIn patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD, including fatal GVHD, has been reported \nafter treatment with pembrolizumab. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure \nmay be at an increased risk for GVHD after treatment with pembrolizumab. Consider the benefit of \ntreatment with pembrolizumab versus the risk of possible GVHD in patients with a history of \nallogeneic HSCT.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nSevere infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been reported in \npatients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). For Grades 3 or 4 infusion reactions, infusion \nshould be stopped and pembrolizumab permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). Patients with \nGrades 1 or 2 infusion reaction may continue to receive pembrolizumab with close monitoring; \npremedication with antipyretic and antihistamine may be considered.\n\nDisease-specific precautions\n\nUse of pembrolizumab in urothelial carcinoma patients who have received prior platinum-containing \nchemotherapy\nPhysicians should consider the delayed onset of pembrolizumab effect before initiating treatment in \npatients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease. In urothelial carcinoma, a higher \nnumber of deaths within 2 months was observed in pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy (see \nsection 5.1). Factors associated with early deaths were fast progressive disease on prior platinum \ntherapy and liver metastases.\n\nUse of pembrolizumab in urothelial carcinoma for patients who are considered ineligible for \ncisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD-L1 with CPS ≥ 10\nThe baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the study population of KEYNOTE-052 \nincluded a proportion of patients eligible for a carboplatin-based combination, for whom the benefit is \nbeing assessed in a comparative study, and patients eligible for mono-chemotherapy, for whom no \nrandomised data are available. In addition, no safety and efficacy data are available in frailer patients \n(e.g. ECOG performance status 3) considered not eligible for chemotherapy. In the absence of these \ndata, pembrolizumab should be used with caution in this population after careful consideration of the \npotential risk-benefit on an individual basis.\n\nUse of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC\nIn general, the frequency of adverse reactions for pembrolizumab combination therapy is observed to \nbe higher than for pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy alone, reflecting the contributions of \neach of these components (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). A direct comparison of pembrolizumab when \nused in combination with chemotherapy to pembrolizumab monotherapy is not available.\n\n \n\n\n\n76\n\nPhysicians should consider the benefit/risk balance of the available treatment options (pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy) before initiating treatment in \npreviously untreated patients with NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1. \n\nIn KEYNOTE-042, a higher number of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation followed by a \nlong-term survival benefit was observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to \nchemotherapy (see section 5.1).\n\nEfficacy and safety data from patients ≥ 75 years are limited. For patients ≥ 75 years, pembrolizumab \ncombination therapy should be used with caution after careful consideration of the potential \nbenefit/risk on an individual basis (see section 5.1).\n\nUse of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with HNSCC\nIn general, the frequency of adverse reactions for pembrolizumab combination therapy is observed to \nbe higher than for pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy alone, reflecting the contributions of \neach of these components (see section 4.8). \n\nPhysicians should consider the benefit/risk balance of the available treatment options (pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy) before initiating treatment in \npatients with HNSCC whose tumours express PD-L1 (see section 5.1).\n\nUse of pembrolizumab for adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma\nA trend toward increased frequency of severe and serious adverse reactions in patients ≥ 75 years was \nobserved. Safety data of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant melanoma setting in patients ≥ 75 years are \nlimited.\n\nUse of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib for first-line treatment of patients with RCC\nWhen pembrolizumab is given with axitinib, higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT \nand AST elevations have been reported in patients with advanced RCC (see section 4.8). Liver \nenzymes should be monitored before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. More \nfrequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the medicines are used in monotherapy \nmay be considered. Medical management guidelines for both medicines should be followed (see \nsection 4.2 and refer to the SmPC for axitinib). \n\nPatients excluded from clinical studies\nPatients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical studies: active CNS metastases; \nECOG PS ≥ 2 (except for urothelial carcinoma and RCC); HIV infection, hepatitis B or hepatitis C \ninfection; active systemic autoimmune disease; interstitial lung disease; prior pneumonitis requiring \nsystemic corticosteroid therapy; a history of severe hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody; \nreceiving immunosuppressive therapy and a history of severe immune-related adverse reactions from \ntreatment with ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid \ntreatment (> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for greater than 12 weeks. Patients with active \ninfections were excluded from clinical studies and were required to have their infection treated prior to \nreceiving pembrolizumab. Patients with active infections occurring during treatment with \npembrolizumab were managed with appropriate medical therapy. Patients with clinically significant \nrenal (creatinine > 1.5 x ULN) or hepatic (bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, ALT, AST > 2.5 x ULN in the \nabsence of liver metastases) abnormalities at baseline were excluded from clinical studies, therefore \ninformation is limited in patients with severe renal and moderate to severe hepatic impairment.\n\nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in patients with ocular melanoma \n(see section 5.1).\n\nFor subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL, clinical data for the use of pembrolizumab in patients \nineligible to ASCT due to reasons other than failure to salvage chemotherapy are limited (see \nsection 5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n77\n\nAfter careful consideration of the potential increased risk, pembrolizumab may be used with\nappropriate medical management in these patients. \n\nPatient alert card\nAll prescribers of KEYTRUDA must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management \nGuidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of KEYTRUDA therapy with the patient. The patient \nwill be provided with the patient alert card with each prescription.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with pembrolizumab. Since \npembrolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug \ninteractions are expected. \n\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting pembrolizumab should be \navoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of \npembrolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after \nstarting pembrolizumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Corticosteroids \ncan also be used as premedication, when pembrolizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy, \nas antiemetic prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy-related adverse reactions.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with \npembrolizumab and for at least 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data on the use of pembrolizumab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have \nnot been conducted with pembrolizumab; however, in murine models of pregnancy blockade of PD-L1 \nsignalling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to result in an increased foetal loss \n(see section 5.3). These results indicate a potential risk, based on its mechanism of action, that \nadministration of pembrolizumab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, including increased rates \nof abortion or stillbirth. Human immunoglobulins G4 (IgG4) are known to cross the placental barrier; \ntherefore, being an IgG4, pembrolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the \ndeveloping foetus. Pembrolizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition \nof the woman requires treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether pembrolizumab is secreted in human milk. Since it is known that antibodies can \nbe secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision should be \nmade whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue pembrolizumab, taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of pembrolizumab therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nNo clinical data are available on the possible effects of pembrolizumab on fertility. There were no \nnotable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in monkeys based on 1-month and 6-month \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPembrolizumab has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In some patients, \ndizziness and fatigue have been reported following administration of pembrolizumab (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n78\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nPembrolizumab is most commonly associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these, \nincluding severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal \nof pembrolizumab (see “Description of selected adverse reactions” below).\n\nThe safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy has been evaluated in 5,884 patients with advanced \nmelanoma, resected Stage III melanoma (adjuvant therapy), NSCLC, cHL, urothelial carcinoma, or \nHNSCC across four doses (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or \n3 weeks) in clinical studies. The frequencies included below and in Table 2 are based on all reported \nadverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality. In this patient \npopulation, the median observation time was 7.3 months (range: 1 day to 31 months) and the most \nfrequent adverse reactions with pembrolizumab were fatigue (32%), nausea (20%), and \ndiarrhoea (20%). The majority of adverse reactions reported for monotherapy were of Grades 1 or 2 \nseverity. The most serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions and severe \ninfusion-related reactions (see section 4.4).\n\nThe safety of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy has been evaluated in 1,067 patients \nwith NSCLC or HNSCC receiving 200 mg, 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, in \nclinical studies. The frequencies included below and in Table 2 are based on all reported adverse drug \nreactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality. In this patient population, the most \nfrequent adverse reactions were anaemia (50%), nausea (50%), fatigue (37%), constipation (35%), \ndiarrhoea (30%), neutropaenia (30%), decreased appetite (28%) and vomiting (25%). Incidences of \nGrades 3-5 adverse reactions in patients with NSCLC were 67% for pembrolizumab combination \ntherapy and 66% for chemotherapy alone and in patients with HNSCC were 85% for pembrolizumab \ncombination therapy and 84% for chemotherapy plus cetuximab.\n\nThe safety of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib has been evaluated in a clinical study of \n429 patients with advanced RCC receiving 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and 5 mg axitinib \ntwice daily. In this patient population, the most frequent adverse reactions were diarrhoea (54%), \nhypertension (45%), fatigue (38%), hypothyroidism (35%), decreased appetite (30%), palmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia syndrome (28%), nausea (28%), ALT increased (27%), AST increased (26%), \ndysphonia (25%), cough (21%), and constipation (21%). Incidences of Grades 3-5 adverse reactions \nwere 76% for pembrolizumab combination therapy and 71% for sunitinib alone.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies of pembrolizumab as monotherapy or in combination \nwith chemotherapy or other anti-tumour medicines or reported from post-marketing use of \npembrolizumab are listed in Table 2. Adverse reactions known to occur with pembrolizumab or \nchemotherapies given alone may occur during treatment with these medicinal products in \ncombination, even if these reactions were not reported in clinical studies with combination therapy. \nThese reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of \ndecreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions in patients treated with pembrolizumab*\n\nMonotherapy

There was no evidence of an altered \n\n \n\n\n\n85\n\npharmacokinetic or safety profile with anti-pembrolizumab binding or neutralising antibody \ndevelopment.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy has been evaluated in 154 paediatric patients with \nadvanced melanoma, lymphoma, or PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumours at\n2 mg/kg every 3 weeks in the Phase I/II study KEYNOTE-051. The safety profile in these paediatric \npatients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab. The most common \nadverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of paediatric patients) were pyrexia (31%), \nvomiting (26%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), anaemia (21%) and constipation (20%). The \nmajority of adverse reactions reported for monotherapy were of Grades 1 or 2 severity. \nSixty-nine (44.8%) patients had 1 or more Grades 3 to 5 adverse reactions of which 6 (3.9%) patients\nhad 1 or more adverse reactions that resulted in death. The frequencies are based on all reported \nadverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no information on overdose with pembrolizumab. \n\nIn case of overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, \nand appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC18\n\nMechanism of action\nKEYTRUDA is a humanised monoclonal antibody which binds to the programmed cell death-1 \n(PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a \nnegative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell \nimmune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, \nthrough blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting \ncells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nPembrolizumab doses of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 10 mg/kg every \n2 weeks were evaluated in melanoma or previously treated NSCLC clinical studies. Based on the \nmodelling and simulation of dose/exposure relationships for efficacy and safety for pembrolizumab, \nthere are no clinically significant differences in efficacy or safety among the doses of 200 mg every \n3 weeks, 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 400 mg every 6 weeks as monotherapy (see section 4.2).\n\nMelanoma\nKEYNOTE-006: Controlled study in melanoma patients naïve to treatment with ipilimumab\nThe safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-006, a multicentre, \nopen-label, controlled, Phase III study for the treatment of advanced melanoma in patients who were \nnaïve to ipilimumab. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 \n(n=279) or 3 weeks (n=277) or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=278). Patients with BRAF \nV600E mutant melanoma were not required to have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n86\n\nPatients were treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nClinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression were permitted to remain on \ntreatment until disease progression was confirmed. Assessment of tumour status was performed at \n12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter.\n\nOf the 834 patients, 60% were male, 44% were ≥ 65 years (median age was 62 years [range 18-89]) \nand 98% were white. Sixty-five percent of patients had M1c stage, 9% had a history of brain \nmetastases, 66% had no and 34% had one prior therapy. Thirty-one percent had an ECOG \nPerformance Status of 1, 69% had ECOG Performance Status of 0 and 32% had elevated LDH. BRAF \nmutations were reported in 302 (36%) patients. Among patients with BRAF mutant tumours, \n139 (46%) were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were progression free survival (PFS; as assessed by \nIntegrated Radiology and Oncology Assessment [IRO] review using Response Evaluation Criteria in \nSolid Tumours [RECIST], version 1.1) and overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy outcome \nmeasures were objective response rate (ORR) and response duration.

Patients were \nrandomised (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 (n=180) or 10 mg/kg (n=181) every \n3 weeks or chemotherapy (n=179; including dacarbazine, temozolomide, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or \ncarboplatin+paclitaxel). The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease or those receiving \nimmunosuppression; further exclusion criteria were a history of severe or life-threatening \nimmune-related adverse reactions from treatment with ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or \nGrade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for \ngreater than 12 weeks; ongoing adverse reactions ≥ Grade 2 from previous treatment with ipilimumab; \nprevious severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies; a history of pneumonitis or interstitial \nlung disease; HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection and ECOG Performance Status ≥ 2. \n\nPatients were treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nClinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression were permitted to remain on \ntreatment until disease progression was confirmed. Assessment of tumour status was performed at \n12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients on \nchemotherapy who experienced independently-verified progression of disease after the first scheduled \ndisease assessment were able to crossover and receive 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of pembrolizumab every \n3 weeks in a double-blind fashion.\n\nOf the 540 patients, 61% were male, 43% were ≥ 65 years (median age was 62 years [range 15-89]) \nand 98% were white. Eighty-two percent had M1c stage, 73% had at least two and 32% of patients had \nthree or more prior systemic therapies for advanced melanoma. Forty-five percent had an ECOG \nPerformance Status of 1, 40% had elevated LDH and 23% had a BRAF mutated tumour. \n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by IRO using RECIST version 1.1 and \nOS. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration. Table 4 summarises key \nefficacy measures at the final analysis in patients previously treated with ipilimumab, and the \nKaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 3. Both pembrolizumab arms were superior to \nchemotherapy for PFS, and there was no difference between pembrolizumab doses. There was no \nstatistically significant difference between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in the final OS analysis \nthat was not adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of crossover. Of the patients randomised \nto the chemotherapy arm, 55% crossed over and subsequently received treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\n \n\n\n\n90\n\nTable 4: Efficacy results in KEYNOTE-002\n\nEndpoint Pembrolizumab\n2 mg/kg every \n\n3 weeks\nn=180\n\nPembrolizumab\n10 mg/kg every \n\n3 weeks\nn=181\n\nChemotherapy\n\nn=179\nPFS\n\nNumber (%) \nof patients \nwith event\n\n150 (83%) 144 (80%) 172 (96%)\n\nHazard ratio* \n(95% CI)\n\n0.58 (0.46, 0.73) 0.47 (0.37, 0.60) ---\n\np-Value† < 0.001 < 0.001 ---\nMedian in \nmonths \n(95% CI)\n\n2.9 (2.8, 3.8) 3.0 (2.8, 5.2) 2.8 (2.6, 2.8)\n\nOS\nNumber (%) \nof patients \nwith event\n\n123 (68%) 117 (65%) 128 (72%)\n\nHazard ratio* \n(95% CI)\n\n0.86 (0.67, 1.10) 0.74 (0.57, 0.96) ---\n\np-Value† 0.1173 0.0106‡ ---\nMedian in \nmonths \n(95% CI)\n\n13.4 (11.0, 16.4) 14.7 (11.3, 19.5) 11.0 (8.9, 13.8)\n\nBest objective\nresponse\n\nORR % \n(95% CI)\n\n22% (16, 29) 28% (21, 35) 5% (2, 9)\n\nComplete \nresponse %\n\n3% 7% 0%\n\nPartial \nresponse %\n\n19% 20% 5%\n\nResponse \nduration§\n\nMedian in \nmonths \n(range)\n\n22.8 \n(1.4+, 25.3+)\n\nNot reached \n(1.1+, 28.3+)\n\n6.8\n(2.8, 11.3)\n\n% ongoing at \n12 months\n\n73% ¶ 79% ¶ 0% ¶\n\n* Hazard ratio (pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy) based on the stratified Cox \nproportional hazard model\n\n† Based on stratified log-rank test \n‡ Not statistically significant after adjustment for multiplicity\n§ Based on patients with a best objective response as confirmed complete or partial \n\nresponse from the final analysis\n¶ Based on Kaplan-Meier estimation\n\n \n\n\n\n91\n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier curve for progression-free survival by treatment arm in \nKEYNOTE-002 (intent to treat population)\n\nKEYNOTE-001: Open-label study in melanoma patients naïve and previously treated with ipilimumab\nThe safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab for patients with advanced melanoma were investigated in \nan uncontrolled, open-label study, KEYNOTE-001. Efficacy was evaluated for 276 patients from two \ndefined cohorts, one which included patients previously treated with ipilimumab (and if BRAF V600 \nmutation-positive, with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor) and the other which included patients naïve to \ntreatment with ipilimumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of \n2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab until \ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease \nprogression were permitted to remain on treatment until disease progression was confirmed. Exclusion \ncriteria were similar to those of KEYNOTE-002.\n\nOf the 89 patients receiving 2 mg/kg of pembrolizumab who were previously treated with ipilimumab, \n53% were male, 33% were ≥ 65 years of age and the median age was 59 years (range 18-88). All but \ntwo patients were white. Eighty-four percent had M1c stage and 8% of patients had a history of brain \nmetastases. Seventy percent had at least two and 35% of patients had three or more prior systemic \ntherapies for advanced melanoma. BRAF mutations were reported in 13% of the study population. All \npatients with BRAF mutant tumours were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.\n\nOf the 51 patients receiving 2 mg/kg of pembrolizumab who were naïve to treatment with ipilimumab, \n63% were male, 35% were ≥ 65 years of age and the median age was 60 years (range 35-80). All but \none patient was white. Sixty-three percent had M1c stage and 2% of patients had a history of brain \nmetastases. Forty-five percent had no prior therapies for advanced melanoma. BRAF mutations were \nreported in 20 (39%) patients. Among patients with BRAF mutant tumours, 10 (50%) were previously \ntreated with a BRAF inhibitor.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by independent review using \nRECIST 1.1.

Randomisation was stratified by American Joint \nCommittee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition stage (IIIA vs. IIIB vs. IIIC 1-3 positive lymph nodes vs. \nIIIC ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes) and geographic region (North America, European countries, Australia \nand other countries as designated). Patients must have undergone lymph node dissection, and if \nindicated, radiotherapy within 13 weeks prior to starting treatment. Patients with active autoimmune \ndisease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were \nineligible. Patients who received prior therapy for melanoma other than surgery or interferon for thick \nprimary melanomas without evidence of lymph node involvement were ineligible. Patients underwent \nimaging every 12 weeks after the first dose of pembrolizumab for the first two years, then every \n6 months from year 3 to 5, and then annually.\n\nAmong the 1,019 patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 54 years (25% age 65 or \nolder); 62% male; and ECOG PS of 0 (94%) and 1 (6%). Sixteen percent had stage IIIA; 46% had \nstage IIIB; 18% had stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes) and 20% had stage IIIC (≥ 4 positive lymph \nnodes); 50% were BRAF V600 mutation positive and 44% were BRAF wild-type. PD-L1 expression \nwas tested retrospectively by immunohistochemistry assay with the 22C3 anti-PD-L1 antibody; 84% \n\n \n\n\n\n95\n\nof patients had PD-L1-positive melanoma (PD-L1 expression in ≥ 1% of tumour and \ntumour-associated immune cells relative to all viable tumour cells). The same scoring system was used \nfor metastatic melanoma (MEL score).\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS) in \nthe whole population and in the population with PD-L1 positive tumours, where RFS was defined as \nthe time between the date of randomisation and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant \nmetastasis) or death, whichever occurs first. The study demonstrated a statistically significant \nimprovement in RFS for patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo at the \npre-specified interim analysis. Efficacy results based on an additional seven months of follow-up are\nsummarised in Table 10 and Figure 4.\n\nTable 10: Efficacy results in KEYNOTE-054\n\nEndpoint KEYTRUDA\n200 mg every \n\n3 weeks\nn=514\n\nPlacebo\n\nn=505\nNumber (%) of patients with \nevent \n\n158 (31%) 246 (49%)\n\nMedian in months (95% CI) NR 21.7 (17.1, NR)\nHazard ratio* (98% CI) 0.56 (0.44, 0.72)\n\np-Value (stratified log-rank) < 0.0001\nRFS at 6 months\n\nRFS rate 82% 73%\nRFS at 12 months\n\nRFS rate 76% 61%\nRFS at 18 months\n\nRFS rate 72% 54%\n* Based on the stratified Cox proportional hazard model\n\nNR = not reached\n\nKEYNOTE-054 enrolled patients per AJCC 7th edition and a subgroup analysis of RFS per AJCC \n8th edition was performed after the RFS study results were reported. A statistically significant \nimprovement in RFS for patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo was \ndemonstrated in the overall population across resected stage III melanoma per AJCC 7th edition. \nStage IIIA melanoma according to the AJCC 8th edition identifies a patient population with a better \nprognosis compared to stage IIIA according to AJCC 7th edition. Per the AJCC 8th edition \nclassification, a total of 82 subjects were classified as stage IIIA; 42 in the pembrolizumab arm and 40 \nin the placebo arm; with a total of 13 RFS events; 6 in the pembrolizumab arm and 7 in the placebo \narm.

Patients had \nPD-L1 expression with a  50% TPS based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. Patients were \nrandomised (1:1) to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=154) or \ninvestigator’s choice platinum-containing chemotherapy (n=151; including pemetrexed+carboplatin, \npemetrexed+cisplatin, gemcitabine+cisplatin, gemcitabine+carboplatin, or paclitaxel+carboplatin. \nPatients with non-squamous NSCLC could receive pemetrexed maintenance.). Patients were treated \nwith pembrolizumab until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Treatment could continue \n\n \n\n\n\n97\n\nbeyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving \nclinical benefit by the investigator. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to \n24 months. The study excluded patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations; autoimmune \ndisease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required \nimmunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior \n26 weeks. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 weeks. Patients on chemotherapy who \nexperienced independently-verified progression of disease were able to crossover and receive \npembrolizumab.\n\nAmong the 305 patients in KEYNOTE-024, baseline characteristics were: median age 65 years (54% \nage 65 or older); 61% male; 82% White, 15% Asian; and ECOG performance status 0 and 1 in 35% \nand 65%, respectively. Disease characteristics were squamous (18%) and non-squamous (82%); M1 \n(99%); and brain metastases (9%).\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review\n(BICR) using RECIST 1.1. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR (as assessed by \nBICR using RECIST 1.1). Table 12 summarises key efficacy measures for the entire intent to treat \n(ITT) population.

Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive one of the following regimens:\n\n Pembrolizumab 200 mg with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and investigator’s choice of \ncisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks for \n4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously \nevery 3 weeks (n=410)\n\n Placebo with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and investigator’s choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or \ncarboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by \nplacebo and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n=206)\n\nTreatment with pembrolizumab continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease as \ndetermined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of \npembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression by BICR or beyond \ndiscontinuation of pemetrexed if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as \n\n \n\n\n\n101\n\ndetermined by the investigator. For patients who completed 24 months of therapy or had a complete \nresponse, treatment with pembrolizumab could be reinitiated for disease progression and administered \nfor up to 1 additional year. Assessment of tumour status was performed at Week 6 and Week 12, \nfollowed by every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo plus chemotherapy who experienced \nindependently-verified progression of disease were offered pembrolizumab as monotherapy.\n\nAmong the 616 patients in KEYNOTE-189, baseline characteristics were: median age of 64 years \n(49% age 65 or older); 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; 43% and 56% ECOG performance status \nof 0 or 1 respectively; 31% PD-L1 negative (TPS < 1%); and 18% with treated or untreated brain \nmetastases at baseline.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1). \nSecondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration, as assessed by BICR using \nRECIST 1.1.

The key eligibility criteria for this study were metastatic squamous NSCLC, \nregardless of tumour PD-L1 expression status, and no prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease. \nPatients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a \nmedical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic \nradiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1 \nexpression (TPS < 1% [negative] vs. TPS ≥ 1%), investigator’s choice of paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, \nand geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia). Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the \nfollowing treatment arms via intravenous infusion:\n\n Pembrolizumab 200 mg and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day \ncycle for 4 cycles, and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for \n4 cycles or nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for \n4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab was \nadministered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1.\n\n Placebo and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for \n4 cycles and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles or \nnab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, \nfollowed by placebo every 3 weeks.\n\nTreatment with pembrolizumab or placebo continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease \nas determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of \npembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was \nclinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. \n\nPatients in the placebo arm were offered pembrolizumab as a single agent at the time of disease \nprogression.\n\nAssessment of tumour status was performed every 6 weeks through Week 18, every 9 weeks through \nWeek 45 and every 12 weeks thereafter. \n\nA total of 559 patients were randomised. The study population characteristics were: median age of \n65 years (range: 29 to 88); 55% age 65 or older; 81% male; 77% White; ECOG performance status of \n0 (29%) and 1 (71%); and 8% with treated brain metastases at baseline. Thirty-five percent had \ntumour PD-L1 expression TPS < 1% [negative]; 19% were East Asian; and 60% received paclitaxel.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1). \nSecondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration, as assessed by BICR using \nRECIST 1.1.

The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease; a medical \ncondition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic \nradiation within the prior 26 weeks.

Data from these patients are too limited to draw any conclusion on safety or efficacy \nin this population.\n\nUrothelial Carcinoma\nKEYNOTE-045: Controlled study in urothelial carcinoma patients who have received prior \nplatinum-containing chemotherapy\nThe safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in KEYNOTE-045, a multicentre, \nopen-label, randomised (1:1), controlled study for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic \nurothelial carcinoma in patients with disease progression on or after platinum-containing \nchemotherapy. Patients must have received first line platinum-containing regimen for locally \nadvanced/metastatic disease or as neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment, with recurrence/progression \n≤ 12 months following completion of therapy. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either \npembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=270) or investigator’s choice of any of the following \nchemotherapy regimens all given intravenously every 3 weeks (n=272): paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (n=84), \ndocetaxel 75 mg/m2 (n=84), or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 (n=87). Patients were treated with \npembrolizumab until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Treatment could continue beyond \nprogression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the \ninvestigator. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The study \nexcluded patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression and \n\n \n\n\n\n113\n\npatients with more than 2 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. \nPatients with an ECOG performance status of 2 had to have a haemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, could not have \nliver metastases, and must have received the last dose of their last prior chemotherapy regimen \n≥ 3 months prior to enrolment. Assessment of tumour status was performed at 9 weeks after the first \ndose, then every 6 weeks through the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. \n\nAmong the 542 randomised patients in KEYNOTE-045, baseline characteristics were: median age \n66 years (range: 26 to 88), 58% age 65 or older; 74% male; 72% White and 23% Asian; 56% ECOG \nperformance status of 1 and 1% ECOG performance status of 2; and 96% M1 disease and 4% M0 \ndisease. Eighty-seven percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 34% with liver metastases. \nEighty-six percent had a primary tumour in the lower tract and 14% had a primary tumour in the upper\ntract. Fifteen percent of patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing \nneoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-one percent had received 2 prior systemic regimens in \nthe metastatic setting. Seventy-six percent of patients received prior cisplatin, 23% had prior \ncarboplatin, and 1% was treated with other platinum-based regimens.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcomes were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1. \nSecondary outcome measures were ORR (as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1) and duration of \nresponse. Table 20 summarises the key efficacy measures for the ITT population at the final analysis. \nThe Kaplan-Meier curve based on the final analysis for OS is shown in Figure 13. The study \ndemonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and ORR for patients randomised to \npembrolizumab as compared to chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference \nbetween pembrolizumab and chemotherapy with respect to PFS. \n\n \n\n\n\n114\n\nTable 20: Response to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks in patients with urothelial \ncarcinoma previously treated with chemotherapy in KEYNOTE-045\n\nEndpoint Pembrolizumab\n200 mg every \n\n3 weeks\nn=270\n\nChemotherapy\n\nn=272\n\nOS\nNumber (%) of patients with event 200 (74%) 219 (81%)\nHazard ratio* (95% CI) 0.70 (0.57, 0.85)\np-Value† < 0.001\nMedian in months (95% CI) 10.1 (8.0, 12.3) 7.3 (6.1, 8.1)\n\nPFS‡\n\nNumber (%) of patients with event 233 (86%) 237 (87%)\nHazard ratio* (95% CI) 0.96 (0.79, 1.16)\np-Value† 0.313\nMedian in months (95% CI) 2.1 (2.0, 2.2) 3.3 (2.4, 3.6)\n\nObjective response rate‡\n\nORR % (95% CI) 21% (16, 27) 11% (8, 15)\np-Value§ < 0.001\n\nComplete response 9% 3%\nPartial response 12% 8%\nStable disease 17% 34%\n\nResponse duration‡,¶\n\nMedian in months (range) Not reached\n(1.6+, 30.0+)\n\n4.4\n(1.4+, 29.9+)\n\nNumber (%#) of patients with duration ≥ 6 months 46 (84%) 8 (47%)\nNumber (%#) of patients with duration ≥ 12 \nmonths\n\n35 (68%) 5 (35%)\n\n* Hazard ratio (pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy) based on the stratified Cox proportional hazard model\n† Based on stratified log-rank test\n‡ Assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1\n§ Based on method by Miettinen and Nurminen\n¶ Based on patients with a best objective response as confirmed complete or partial response\n# Based on Kaplan-Meier estimation\n\n \n\n\n\n115\n\nFigure 13: Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival by treatment arm in KEYNOTE-045 (intent \nto treat population)\n\nAn analysis was performed in KEYNOTE-045 in patients who had PD-L1 CPS < 10 [pembrolizumab: \nn=186 (69%) vs. chemotherapy: n= 176 (65%)] or ≥ 10 [pembrolizumab: n=74 (27%) vs. \nchemotherapy: n= 90 (33%)] in both pembrolizumab- and chemotherapy-treated arms (see Table 21).\n\nTable 21: OS by PD-L1 Expression\n\nPD-L1 Expression Pembrolizumab Chemotherapy\nOS by PD-L1 Expression\n\nNumber (%) of patients with event*\nHazard\n\nRatio† (95% CI)\nCPS < 10 140 (75%) 144 (82%) 0.75 (0.59, 0.95)\nCPS ≥ 10 53 (72%) 72 (80%) 0.55 (0.37, 0.81)\n\n* Based on final analysis\n† Hazard ratio (pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy) based on the stratified Cox proportional hazard model\n\nPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30.

Patients with \nnasopharyngeal carcinoma, active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years \nof treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for the study. \nRandomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50% or < 50%), HPV status \n(positive or negative), and ECOG PS (0 vs. 1). Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to one of the following \ntreatment arms:\n\n Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks\n Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks or \n\ncisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, and 5-FU 1,000 mg/m2/d 4 days continuous every \n3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and 5-FU)\n\n Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 load then 250 mg/m2 once weekly, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min \nevery 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, and 5-FU 1,000 mg/m2/d 4 days \ncontinuous every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and 5-FU)\n\nTreatment with pembrolizumab continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease as \ndetermined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of \npembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was \nclinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of \ntumour status was performed at Week 9 and then every 6 weeks for the first year, followed by every \n9 weeks through 24 months. \n\n \n\n\n\n118\n\nAmong the 882 patients in KEYNOTE-048, 754 (85%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with a \nCPS ≥ 1 based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of these \n754 patients included: median age of 61 years (range: 20 to 94); 36% age 65 or older; 82% male; 74% \nWhite and 19% Asian; 61% ECOG performance status of 1; and 77% former/current smokers. Disease \ncharacteristics were: 21% HPV positive and 95% had stage IV disease (stage IVa 21%, stage IVb 6%, \nand stage IVc 69%).\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (assessed by BICR according to \nRECIST 1.1). The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for all patients \nrandomised to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to standard treatment \n(HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60-0.87) and in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 randomised to \npembrolizumab monotherapy compared to standard treatment.

\nchemotherapy\nThe safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-040, a multicentre, \nopen-label, randomised, controlled study for the treatment of histologically confirmed recurrent or \nmetastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, pharynx or larynx in patients who had disease progression on or \nafter platinum-containing chemotherapy administered for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC or following \nplatinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy, \nand were not amenable to local therapy with curative intent. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 \nexpression (TPS ≥ 50%), HPV status and ECOG performance status and then randomised (1:1) to \nreceive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=247) or one of three standard treatments\n(n=248): methotrexate 40 mg/m2 once weekly (n=64), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks (n=99), \nor cetuximab 400 mg/m2 loading dose and then 250 mg/m2 once weekly (n=71). Treatment could \ncontinue beyond progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving \nclinical benefit by the investigator. The study excluded patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, active \nautoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment, a medical condition \nthat required immunosuppression, or who were previously treated with 3 or more systemic regimens \nfor recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. Assessment of tumour status was performed at 9 weeks, then \nevery 6 weeks through Week 52, followed by every 9 weeks through 24 months.\n\nAmong the 495 patients in KEYNOTE-040, 129 (26%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with a \nTPS ≥ 50% based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of these \n129 patients included: median age 62 years (40% age 65 or older); 81% male; 78% White, 11% Asian, \nand 2% Black; 23% and 77% with an ECOG performance status 0 or 1, respectively; and 19% with \nHPV positive tumours. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of patients had M1 disease and the majority had \nstage IV disease (stage IV 32%, stage IVa 14%, stage IVb 4%, and stage IVc 44%). Sixteen\npercent (16%) had disease progression following platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant \nchemotherapy, and 84% had received 1-2 prior systemic regimens for metastatic disease.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome was OS in the ITT population. The initial analysis resulted in a HR for \nOS of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.01) with a one-sided p-value of 0.0316. The median OS was 8.4 months \nfor pembrolizumab compared to 7.1 months for standard treatment. Table 28 summarises the key \nefficacy measures for the TPS ≥ 50% population. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS for the TPS ≥ 50% \npopulation is shown in Figure 16.\n\n \n\n\n\n124\n\nTable 28: Efficacy of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks in HNSCC patients with TPS ≥ 50% \nwho were previously treated with platinum chemotherapy in KEYNOTE-040\n\nEndpoint Pembrolizumab\n200 mg every 3 weeks\n\nn=64\n\nStandard Treatment*\nn=65\n\nOS\n   Number (%) of patients with event 41 (64) 56 (86)\n   Hazard ratio† (95% CI) 0.53 (0.35, 0.81)\n   p-Value‡ 0.001\n   Median in months (95% CI) 11.6 (8.3, 19.5) 6.6 (4.8, 9.2)\nPFS§\n\n   Number (%) of patients with event 52 (81) 58 (89)\n   Hazard ratio† (95% CI) 0.58 (0.39, 0.86)\n   p-Value‡ 0.003\n   Median in months (95% CI) 3.5 (2.1, 6.3) 2.1 (2.0, 2.4)\n   Rate (%) at 6 months (95% CI) 40.1 (28.1, 51.9) 17.1 (8.8, 27.7)\nObjective response rate§\n\nORR % (95% CI) 26.6 (16.3, 39.1) 9.2 (3.5, 19.0)\np-Value¶ 0.0009\n          Complete response 5% 2%\n          Partial response 22% 8%\n          Stable disease 23% 23%\nResponse duration§,#\n\n   Median in months (range) Not reached (2.7, 13.8+) 6.9 (4.2, 18.8)\nNumber (%Þ) of patients with duration \n≥ 6 months\n\n9 (66) 2 (50)\n* Methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab\n† Hazard ratio (pembrolizumab compared to standard treatment) based on the stratified Cox proportional hazard \n\nmodel\n‡ One-sided p-Value based on log-rank test\n§ Assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1\n¶ Based on method by Miettinen and Nurminen\n# Based on patients with a best objective response as confirmed complete or partial response\nÞ Based on Kaplan-Meier estimation \n\n \n\n\n\n125\n\nFigure 16: Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival by treatment arm in KEYNOTE-040\npatients with PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50%)\n\nRenal cell carcinoma\nKEYNOTE-426: Controlled study of combination therapy in RCC patients naïve to treatment\nThe efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib was investigated in KEYNOTE-426, \na randomised, multicentre, open-label, active-controlled study conducted in patients with advanced \nRCC with clear cell component, regardless of PD-L1 tumour expression status and International \nMetastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group categories. The study excluded patients with \nautoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Randomisation was \nstratified by risk categories (favourable versus intermediate versus poor) and geographic region (North \nAmerica versus Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”). Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of \nthe following treatment arms:\n\n pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in combination with axitinib 5 mg \norally, twice daily. Patients who tolerated axitinib 5 mg twice daily for 2 consecutive \ntreatment cycles (i.e. 6 weeks) with no > Grade 2 treatment-related adverse events to \naxitinib and with blood pressure well controlled to ≤ 150/90 mm Hg were permitted \ndose escalation of axitinib to 7 mg twice daily. Dose escalation of axitinib to 10 mg \ntwice daily was permitted using the same criteria. Axitinib could be interrupted or \nreduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity.\n\n sunitinib 50 mg orally, once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks.\n\nTreatment with pembrolizumab and axitinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of \ndisease as verified by BICR or confirmed by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or for \npembrolizumab, a maximum of 24 months. Administration of pembrolizumab and axitinib was \npermitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and \nconsidered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator.

At the time of this analysis, the hazard ratio in the overall population (95% CI) \nwas 0.59 (0.45, 0.78) with 84/432 (19.4%) events in the combination arm and 122/429 (28.4%) events \nin the sunitinib arm. The 12-month OS rate was 89.5% (95% CI 86.2, 92.1) for pembrolizumab in \ncombination with axitinib and 78.8% (95% CI 74.7, 82.4) for sunitinib. The 18-month OS rate was \n81.0% (95% CI 76.7, 84.6) for pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib and 70.7% (95% CI 65.8, \n75.1) for sunitinib. For the IMDC risk category, the OS hazard ratio for the favourable risk group was \n0.94 (95% CI 0.43, 2.07), for the intermediate risk group the OS hazard ratio was 0.52 (95% CI 0.36, \n0.75), and for the poor risk group the OS hazard ratio was 0.50 (95% CI 0.29, 0.87).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn KEYNOTE-051, 154 paediatric patients (60 children aged 6 months to less than 12 years and\n94 adolescents aged 12 years to 18 years) with advanced melanoma or PD-L1 positive advanced, \nrelapsed, or refractory solid tumours or lymphoma were administered pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every \n3 weeks. All patients received pembrolizumab for a median of 3 doses (range 1-35 doses), with \n130 patients (84.4%) receiving pembrolizumab for 2 doses or more. Participants were enrolled across \n28 tumour types by primary diagnosis. The most common tumour types by histology were Hodgkin \nlymphoma (11.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.1%), neuroblastoma (6.5%), osteosarcoma (6.5%) and \nmelanoma (5.2%). Of the 154 patients, 134 were enrolled with solid tumours, 18 with Hodgkin \nlymphoma, and 2 with other lymphomas. In patients with solid tumours and other lymphomas, the \nORR was 5.9%, no patient had a complete response and 8 patients (5.9%) had a partial response. In \nthe Hodgkin lymphoma population, the ORR was 50.0%, 2 patients (11.1%) had a complete response \nand 7 patients (38.9%) had a partial response.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \npembrolizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab was studied in 2,993 patients with metastatic or unresectable \nmelanoma, NSCLC, or carcinoma who received doses in the range of 1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, \n2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 200 mg every 3 weeks.\n\nAbsorption\nPembrolizumab is administered via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely \nbioavailable.\n\nDistribution\nConsistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at \nsteady-state is small (~6.0 L; CV: 20%). As expected for an antibody, pembrolizumab does not bind to \nplasma proteins in a specific manner.\n\n \n\n\n\n130\n\nBiotransformation\nPembrolizumab is catabolised through non-specific pathways; metabolism does not contribute to its \nclearance.\n\nElimination\nPembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after \nachieving maximal change at steady-state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); \nthis decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value \n(CV%) for the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nExposure to pembrolizumab as expressed by peak concentration (Cmax) or area under the plasma \nconcentration time curve (AUC) increased dose proportionally within the dose range for efficacy. \nSteady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with an \nevery 3 week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.1-fold. The median trough concentrations \n(Cmin) at steady-state were approximately 22 mcg/mL at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks and \n29 mcg/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. The median area under the concentration time curve at \nsteady-state over 3 weeks (AUC0-3weeks) was 794 mcg∙day/mL at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks and \n1,053 mcg∙day/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.\n\nFollowing administration of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks in patients with cHL, the observed \nmedian Cmin at steady-state was up to 40% higher than that in other tumour types treated with the same \ndosage; however, the range of trough concentrations is similar. There are no notable differences in \nmedian Cmax between cHL and other tumour types. Based on available safety data in cHL and other \ntumour types, these differences are not clinically meaningful.\n\nSpecial populations\nThe effects of various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab were assessed in \npopulation pharmacokinetic analyses. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the \nclearance of pembrolizumab: age (range 15-94 years), gender, race, mild or moderate renal \nimpairment, mild hepatic impairment and tumour burden. The relationship between body weight and \nclearance supports the use of either fixed dose or body weight-based dosing to provide adequate and \nsimilar control of exposure. Pembrolizumab concentrations with weight-based dosing at 2 mg/kg every \n3 weeks in paediatric patients (2 to 17 years) are comparable to those of adults at the same dose.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe effect of renal impairment on the clearance of pembrolizumab was evaluated by population \npharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients \nwith normal renal function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of pembrolizumab \nwere found between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal \nfunction. Pembrolizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nHepatic impairment\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of pembrolizumab was evaluated by population \npharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild hepatic impairment (as defined using the US National \nCancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No \nclinically important differences in the clearance of pembrolizumab were found between patients with \nmild hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. Pembrolizumab has not been studied in patients \nwith moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe safety of pembrolizumab was evaluated in a 1-month and a 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study in \nCynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous doses of 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg once a week in the \n1-month study and once every two weeks in the 6-month study, followed by a 4-month treatment-free \nperiod. No findings of toxicological significance were observed and the no observed adverse effect \n\n \n\n\n\n131\n\nlevel (NOAEL) in both studies was ≥ 200 mg/kg, which produced exposure multiples of 19 and \n94 times the exposure in humans at doses of 10 and 2 mg/kg, respectively. The exposure multiple \nbetween the NOAEL and a human dose of 200 mg was 74.\n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway \nis thought to be involved in maintaining tolerance to the foetus throughout pregnancy. Blockade of \nPD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and \nto result in an increase in foetal loss. \n\nAnimal fertility studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. In 1 month and 6 month \nrepeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male and female \nreproductive organs; however, many animals in these studies were not sexually mature.\n\n6.

Each vial contains an excess fill of 10 mg (0.4 mL) to ensure the recovery of \n50 mg of KEYTRUDA per vial. After reconstitution, 1 mL of concentrate contains 25 mg of \npembrolizumab.\n\n• To avoid foaming, deliver the water along the walls of the vial and not directly on the \nlyophilised powder.\n\n• Slowly swirl the vial to allow reconstitution of the lyophilised powder. Allow up to 5 minutes \nfor the bubbles to clear. Do not shake the vial.\n\n• Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscolouration prior to administration. Reconstituted KEYTRUDA is a clear to slightly \nopalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution. Discard the vial if visible particles are \nobserved.\n\n• Withdraw the required volume up to 2 mL (50 mg) of KEYTRUDA and transfer into an \nintravenous bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) to \nprepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from 1 to 10 mg/mL. Mix diluted \nsolution by gentle inversion.\n\n• From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted or diluted solution should be used \nimmediately. The reconstituted or diluted solution must not be frozen. If not used immediately, \nchemical and physical in-use stability of KEYTRUDA has been demonstrated for 96 hours at \n2°C to 8°C. This 96-hour total hold from reconstitution may include up to 6 hours at room \ntemperature (at or below 25°C). If refrigerated, the vials and/or intravenous bags must be \nallowed to come to room temperature prior to use. Translucent to white proteinaceous particles \nmay be seen in diluted solution.
