CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFarydak, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, is indicated for the treatment of adult \npatients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior \nregimens including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Farydak should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer \n\n\n\n3 \n\ntherapies. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended starting dose of panobinostat is 20 mg, taken orally once a day, on days 1, 3, 5, 8, \n10 and 12 of a 21-day cycle. Patients should be treated initially for eight cycles. It is recommended \nthat patients with clinical benefit continue the treatment for eight additional cycles. The total duration \nof treatment is up to 16 cycles (48 weeks). \n \nPanobinostat is administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, as shown in \nTables 1 and 2. The bortezomib and dexamethasone prescribing information should be consulted prior \nto the start of the combination treatment to assess whether a dose reduction is required. \n \nThe recommended dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 given as an injection. The recommended dose of \ndexamethasone is 20 mg taken orally on a full stomach. \n \nTable 1 Recommended dosing schedule of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and \n\ndexamethasone (cycles 1-8) \n \n\nCycles 1-8 \n(3-week cycles) \n\nWeek 1 \nDays \n\nWeek 2 \nDays \n\nWeek 3 \n\nFarydak 1  3  5   8  10  12   Rest period \nBortezomib 1   4    8   11    Rest period \nDexamethasone 1 2  4 5   8 9  11 12   Rest period \n\n \nTable 2 Recommended dosing schedule of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and \n\ndexamethasone (cycles 9-16) \n \n\nCycles 9-16 \n(3-week cycles) \n\nWeek 1 \nDays \n\nWeek 2 \nDays \n\nWeek 3 \n\nFarydak 1  3  5   8  10  12   Rest period \nBortezomib 1       8       Rest period \nDexamethasone 1 2      8 9      Rest period \n\n \nMonitoring recommendations \n \nBlood cell counts \nA complete blood cell count must be performed before initiating treatment with panobinostat. The \nbaseline platelet count should be \u2265100 x 109/l and the baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n\u22651.0 x 109/l. Complete blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment (in particular \nbefore each injection of bortezomib, i.e. on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of cycles 1 to 8 and on days 1 and 8 of \ncycles 9 to 16), especially for thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). Prior to initiating any cycle of \ntherapy with panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, platelet count should \nbe at least \u2265100 x 109/l (see section 4.4). Additional blood counts should be considered during the \n\u201crest period\u201d \u2013 e.g. on days 15 and/or 18, especially in patients \u226565 years and patients with a baseline \nplatelet count below 150 x 109/l. \n \nECG \nPanobinostat may increase the QTc interval (see section 4.4). Therefore an ECG should be recorded \nprior to the start of therapy and repeated periodically before each treatment cycle. QTcF should be \n<480 msec prior to initiation of treatment with panobinostat (see below section on dose adjustments \nand section 4.4). \n \nBlood electrolytes \nBlood electrolytes, especially potassium, magnesium and phosphorus, should be measured at baseline \nand monitored periodically as clinically indicated, especially in patients with diarrhoea. Abnormal \nvalues should be corrected as clinically indicated (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nLiver function tests \nLiver function should be monitored prior to treatment and regularly during treatment as clinically \nindicated, especially in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nThyroid function tests \nMild hypothyroidism was reported in patients treated with panobinostat + bortezomib + \ndexamethasone in Study D2308; some patients required treatment (see section 4.4). Thyroid and \npituitary function should be monitored by measuring hormone levels (e.g. free T4 and TSH) as \nclinically indicated. \n \nDose adjustments \nModification of the treatment dose and/or schedule may be required based on individual tolerability. \nClinical judgement on how to continue the treatment should be exercised when a patient experiences \nan adverse drug reaction. \n \nIf a dose reduction is required, the dose of panobinostat should be reduced by decrements of 5 mg (i.e. \nfrom 20 mg to 15 mg or from 15 mg to 10 mg). The dose should not be reduced below 10 mg and the \nsame treatment schedule (3-week treatment cycle) should be kept. \n \nThrombocytopenia \nPlatelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of bortezomib (i.e. on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of \ncycles 1-8, see Table 1, and on days 1 and 8 of cycles 9-16, see Table 2). If patients experience \nthrombocytopenia, panobinostat may need to be temporarily withheld and the subsequent dose may \nneed to be reduced (see Table 3). In patients with platelet count <50 x 109/l (complicated by bleeding) \nor <25 x 109/l, Farydak therapy should be withheld and resumed at a reduced dose upon recovery to \nplatelet count \u226550 x 109/l. Platelet counts should be monitored at least twice a week until \u226550 x 109/l. \nPlatelet transfusions may be required, if clinically indicated (see section 4.4). Discontinuation of \ntreatment may be considered if thrombocytopenia does not improve despite the treatment \nmodifications described below and/or the patient requires repeated platelet transfusions. Additionally, \ndose adjustment of bortezomib may be considered (see bortezomib SmPC and Table 3). \n \nTable 3 Recommended dose modifications for thrombocytopenia \n \n\nThrombocytopenia \ngrade on day of \ntreatment \n\nModification \nof \npanobinostat \nstarting dose \n\nPanobinostat dose \non recovery to \ngrade 2 \nthrombocytopenia \n(\u226550 x 109/l) \n\nModification \nof \nbortezomib \nstarting dose \n\nBortezomib dose on \nrecovery to grade 2 \nthrombocytopenia \n(\u226550 x 109/l) \n1 dose \nomitted \n\nMore \nthan \n1 dose \nomitted \n\nGrade 3 \nPlatelets <50 x 109/l \nwith bleeding \n\nOmit dose Resume at reduced \ndose \n\nOmit dose Resume \nat same \ndose \n\nResume at \nreduced \ndose \n\nGrade 4 \nPlatelets <25 x 109/l \n\nOmit dose Resume at reduced \ndose \n\nOmit dose Resume \nat same \ndose \n\nResume at \nreduced \ndose \n\n \nGastrointestinal toxicity \nGastrointestinal toxicity is very common in patients treated with panobinostat. Patients who \nexperience diarrhoea and nausea or vomiting may require temporary dose discontinuation or dose \n\n\n\n5 \n\nreduction as outlined in Table 4. \n \nTable 4 Recommended dose modifications for gastrointestinal toxicity \n \n\nAdverse \ndrug \nreaction \n\nGrade on day of \ntreatment \n\nModification of \npanobinostat \nstarting dose \n\nPanobinostat \ndose on \nrecovery to \n\u2264 grade 1 \n\nModification \nof \nbortezomib \nstarting dose \n\nBortezomib \ndose on \nrecovery to \n\u2264 grade 1 \n\nDiarrhoea Grade 2 despite \nanti-diarrhoeal \nmedicinal product \n\nOmit dose Resume at the \nsame dose \n\nOmit dose Resume at \nreduced dose \nor change to \nonce weekly \n\nGrade 3 despite \nanti-diarrhoeal \nmedicinal product \n\nOmit dose Resume at \nreduced dose \n\nOmit dose Resume at \nreduced dose \nor with the \nsame dose \nbut with a \nonce-weekly \nschedule \n\nGrade 4 despite \nanti-diarrhoeal \nmedicinal product \n\nPermanently \ndiscontinue \n\n Permanently \ndiscontinue \n\n \n\n \nAt the first sign of abdominal cramping, loose stools or onset of diarrhoea, it is recommended that the \npatient be treated with an anti-diarrhoeal medicinal product (e.g. loperamide). \n \nIn the event of grade 3 nausea or grade 3 or 4 vomiting despite administration of an anti-emetic, \npanobinostat should be temporarily discontinued and resumed at a reduced dose on recovery to \ngrade 1. \n \nProphylactic anti-emetics should be administered at the discretion of the physician and in accordance \nwith local medical practice (see section 4.4). \n \nNeutropenia \nNeutropenia may require temporary or permanent dose reduction. Instructions for dose interruptions \nand reductions for panobinostat are outlined in Table 5. \n \nTable 5 Recommended dose modifications for neutropenia \n \n\nNeutropenia grade \non day of treatment \n\nModification of \npanobinostat \nstarting dose \n\nPanobinostat dose \non recovery to \ngrade 2 neutropenia \n(<1.5-1.0 x 109/l) \n\nModification \nof \nbortezomib \nstarting dose \n\nBortezomib \ndose on \nrecovery to \ngrade 2 \nneutropenia \n(<1.5-1.0 x 109/l) \n\nGrade 3 neutropenia \n(<1.0-0.5 x 109/l) \n\nOmit dose Resume at same dose Omit dose Resume at same \ndose \n\nGrade 4 neutropenia \n(<0.5 x 109/l) or \nfebrile neutropenia \n(<1.0 x 109/l and \nfever \u226538.5\u00b0C) \n\nOmit dose Resume at reduced \ndose \n\nOmit dose Resume at same \ndose \n\n \nIn the event of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, physicians should consider the use of growth factors (e.g. \nG-CSF) according to local guidelines. Discontinuation of treatment may be considered if neutropenia \ndoes not improve despite the dose modifications and/or despite the addition of granulocyte colony \nstimulating factor therapy according to local medical practice and treatment guidelines, and/or in the \n\n\n\n6 \n\nevent of severe secondary infections. \n \nQTc prolongation \nIn the event of long QT interval prior to initiation of panobinostat (QTcF \u2265480 msec at baseline), the \nstart of treatment should be delayed until pre-dose average QTcF has returned to <480 msec. In \naddition any abnormal serum potassium, magnesium or phosphorus values should be corrected prior to \ninitiation of Farydak therapy (see section 4.4). In the event of QT prolongation during treatment: \n\u2022 The dose should be omitted, if QTcF is \u2265480 msec or above 60 msec from baseline. \n\u2022 If QT prolongation is resolved within 7 days, resume treatment at prior dose for initial \n\noccurrence or at reduced dose if QT prolongation is recurrent. \n\u2022 If QT prolongation is unresolved within 7 days, treatment should be discontinued. \n\u2022 If any QTcF value is above 500 msec, Farydak therapy should be permanently discontinued. \n \nOther adverse drug reactions \nFor patients experiencing severe adverse drug reactions other than thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal \ntoxicity, neutropenia or QTc prolongation, the recommendation is the following: \n\u2022 CTC grade 2 toxicity recurrence or CTC grades 3 and 4 - omit the dose until recovery to CTC \n\ngrade \u22641 and resume treatment at a reduced dose. \n\u2022 CTC grade 3 or 4 toxicity recurrence - a further dose reduction may be considered once the \n\nadverse reaction has resolved to CTC grade <1. \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with renal impairment \nPlasma exposure of panobinostat is not altered in cancer patients with mild to severe renal impairment. \nTherefore, starting dose adjustments are not necessary. Panobinostat has not been studied in patients \nwith end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nA clinical study in cancer patients with impaired hepatic function showed that plasma exposure of \npanobinostat increased by 43% (1.4-fold) and 105% (2-fold) in patients with mild and moderate \nhepatic impairment, respectively. Patients with mild hepatic impairment should be started on \npanobinostat at a reduced dose of 15 mg during the first treatment cycle. A dose escalation from \n15 mg to 20 mg may be considered based on patient tolerability. Patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment should be started on panobinostat at a reduced dose of 10 mg during the first treatment \ncycle. A dose escalation from 10 mg to 15 mg may be considered based on patient tolerability. \nFrequency of monitoring of these patients should be increased during treatment with panobinostat, \nparticularly during the dose escalation phase. Panobinostat should not be administered in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment due to lack of experience and safety data in this population. Adjustment of \nbortezomib dose should also be considered (see bortezomib SmPC and Table 6). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 6 Recommended starting dose modification for patients with hepatic impairment \n \n\nGrade of \nhepatic \nimpairment* \n\nBilirubin level SGOT \n(AST) levels \n\nModification of \npanobinostat starting \ndose \n\nModification of \nbortezomib starting \ndose \n\nMild \u22641.0 x ULN >ULN Reduce panobinostat \ndose to 15 mg in the \nfirst treatment cycle. \nConsider dose \nescalation up to 20 mg \nin subsequent cycles \nbased on patient \ntolerability. \n\nNone \n>1.0 x ULN and \n\u22641.5 x ULN \n\nAny \n\nModerate >1.5 x ULN and \n\u22643.0 x ULN \n\nAny Reduce panobinostat \ndose to 10 mg in the \nfirst treatment cycle. \nConsider dose \nescalation up to 15 mg \nin subsequent cycles \nbased on patient \ntolerability. \n\nReduce bortezomib \ndose to 0.7 mg/m2 in \nthe first treatment \ncycle. Consider dose \nescalation to \n1.0 mg/m2 or further \ndose reduction to \n0.5 mg/m2 in \nsubsequent cycles \nbased on patient \ntolerability. \n\nSGOT = serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase; \nAST = aspartate aminotransferase \nULN = upper limit of the normal range \n* Based on NCI-CTEP classification \n\n \nElderly population \nPatients over 65 years of age had a higher frequency of selected adverse reactions and of \ndiscontinuation of treatment because of adverse reactions. It is recommended to monitor patients over \n65 years of age more frequently, especially for thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nFor patients >75 years of age, depending on the patient\u2019s general condition and concomitant diseases, \nan adjustment of the starting doses or schedule of the components of the combination regimen may be \nconsidered. Panobinostat may be started at a dose of 15 mg, and if tolerated in the first cycle escalated \nto 20 mg in the second cycle. Bortezomib may be started at 1.3 mg/m2 once weekly on days 1 and 8, \nand dexamethasone at 20 mg on days 1 and 8. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of panobinostat in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years in the \nindication multiple myeloma (see section 5.2). \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn patients who take concomitant medicinal products which are strong CYP3A and/or Pgp inhibitors, \nincluding, but not limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin, posaconazole and nefazodone, the dose of panobinostat should be reduced to 10 mg \n(see section 4.5). If continuous treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is required, a dose escalation \nfrom 10 mg to 15 mg panobinostat may be considered based on patient tolerability. \n \nIn patients with hepatic impairment receiving concomitant medicinal products which are strong \nCYP3A4 inhibitors, treatment with panobinostat should be avoided due to lack of experience and \nsafety data in this patient population. \n \nStrong CYP3A inhibitors should not be started in patients who have already received a reduced dose \n\n\n\n8 \n\nof panobinostat due to adverse reactions. If this is unavoidable, patients should be closely monitored \nand further dose reduction or discontinuation may be considered as clinically indicated (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFarydak should be administered orally once daily on scheduled days only, at the same time each day. \nThe capsules should be swallowed whole with water, with or without food (see section 5.2), and they \nshould not be opened, crushed or chewed. If a dose is missed, it can be taken up to 12 hours after the \nspecified dose time. If vomiting occurs the patient should not take an additional dose, but should take \nthe next usual prescribed dose. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPanobinostat is used in combination treatment, therefore the prescribing information of bortezomib \nand dexamethasone should be consulted prior to initiation of treatment with panobinostat. \n \nDecrease in blood cell count \n \nHaematological adverse drug reactions, including severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia \n(CTC grade 3 to 4) were reported in patients treated with panobinostat. Therefore a complete blood \ncount must be performed before initiating therapy with panobinostat, with frequent monitoring during \ntreatment (in particular before each injection of bortezomib as per bortezomib SmPC). \n \nThe platelet count should be \u2265100 x 109/l and the absolute neutrophil count \u22651.0 x 109/l prior to \ninitiation of treatment. Platelet count should be \u2265100 x 109/l prior to initiating any cycle of treatment \n(see section 4.2). \n \nIn the phase III study, thrombocytopenia typically recovered to baseline by the start of the next 21-day \ncycle (see Figure 1). The median time to onset for grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was one month and \nthe median time to recovery was 12 days. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nFigure 1 Median platelet counts over time (Study D2308, Safety set, cycles 1-8) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPAN=panobinostat  \nBTZ= bortezomib \nDex = dexamethasone \n \nIn patients with CTC grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 109/l with bleeding) \npanobinostat may need to be temporarily withheld and/or the subsequent dose may need to be reduced. \nPlatelet transfusions may be required as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nHaemorrhage \n \nHaemorrhage has been reported in patients during treatment with panobinostat. CTC grade 3 or 4 \nhaemorrhage was reported in 4.2% of patients, including cases of gastrointestinal and pulmonary \nhaemorrhage with fatal outcomes. Therefore, physicians and patients should be aware of the increased \nrisk of thrombocytopenia and the potential for haemorrhage, especially in patients with coagulation \ndisorders or in those who are receiving chronic anti-coagulation therapy. \n \nInfection \n \nLocalised and systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal \ninfections such as aspergillosis or candidiasis, and viral infections including hepatitis B virus and \nherpes simplex, have been reported in patients taking panobinostat. Some of these infections (e.g. \npneumonia) have been severe (e.g. leading to sepsis, or respiratory or multi-organ failure) and have \nhad fatal outcomes (see section 4.8). Of note, whereas grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia were observed \nin 28% and 7% of patients, respectively, febrile neutropenia was observed in 1% of patients (see \nsection 4.8). Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with \npanobinostat. \n \nFarydak treatment should not be initiated in patients with active infections. Pre-existing infections \nshould be treated prior to initiation of the therapy. Patients should be monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of infections during treatment with panobinostat; if a diagnosis of infection is made, \nappropriate anti-infective treatment should be instituted promptly and interruption or discontinuation \nof Farydak considered. \n \nIf a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, panobinostat should be discontinued and \nappropriate anti-fungal therapy instituted. \n \n\n(BL) 1:4  1:8  1:11 2:1 2:4  2:8  2:11 3:1 3:4  3:8 3:11 4:1  4:4  4:8 4:11 5:1  5:4  5:8 5:11 6:1  6:4 6:8 6:11 7:1  7:4  7:8 7:11 8:1  8:4  8:8  8:11  \n\n100 \n\n200 \n\n300 \n\n400 \n\n500 \n\n0 \n\nPAN+BTZ+Dex PBO+BTZ+Dex \nPAN+BTZ+Dex   n=       381    370    367    363    351   342    335    320    323    310   298     283   285     265    268    250   253    232   238    225    230    206   206  199    205    183    188    175    185   159    170     155 \nPBO+BTZ+Dex  n=        377    364    368    365   357   349    340    339     335    325   313     302   308     292    292    279   275    255   259    241    251    234   242   203   233    209    217    204     211   192   194     188  \n\nCycle:Day \n\n \nPl\n\nat\nel\n\net\ns \n\n10\n x\n\n 1\n09\n\n/l \n\n\n\n10 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nSevere nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting, sometimes requiring the use of anti-emetic and \nanti-diarrhoeal medicinal products, have been reported in patients treated with Farydak (see \nsection 4.8). Fluid and electrolyte blood levels, especially potassium, magnesium and phosphate, \nshould be monitored periodically during therapy and corrected as clinically indicated to prevent \npotential dehydration and electrolyte disturbances (see section 4.2). \n \nProphylactic anti-emetics (e.g. prochlorperazine) may be considered at the discretion of the physician \nand in accordance with local medical practice. Anti-emetic medicinal products with a known risk of \nQT prolongation such as dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron and tropisetron should be used with \ncaution (see section 4.5). \n \nAt the first sign of abdominal cramping, loose stools or onset of diarrhoea, it is recommended that the \npatient be treated with anti-diarrhoeal medicinal product (e.g. loperamide) or any additional treatment \nin accordance with local treatment guidelines. Replacement intravenous fluids and electrolytes may be \nused as appropriate. Medicinal products with laxative properties should be used with caution because \nof the potential for exacerbation of diarrhoea. Patients should be advised to contact their physician to \ndiscuss the use of any laxative product. \n \nElectrocardiographic changes \n \nPanobinostat may prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT interval). \n \nNo episodes of QTcF prolongation >500 msec were reported with the dose of 20 mg Farydak in the \nphase III clinical study, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Pooled clinical data from \nover 500 patients treated with panobinostat alone in multiple indications and at different dose levels \nhave shown that the incidence of CTC grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec) was \napproximately 1% overall and 5% or more at a dose of 60 mg or higher; no episodes of torsades de \npointes were observed. \n \nAdditional analysis suggests that the risk of QTc prolongation does not increase over time (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nQTcF should be <480 msec prior to initiation of treatment with Farydak. \n \nAppropriate monitoring of electrolytes (e.g. potassium, magnesium and phosphorus) and ECG should \nbe performed at baseline and periodically during treatment, particularly in patients with severe \ngastrointestinal adverse drug reaction (see section 4.2). \n \nFarydak should be used with caution in patients who already have or who are at significant risk of \ndeveloping QTc prolongation. This includes patients: \n\u2022 with long QT syndrome. \n\u2022 with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, \n\ncongestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. \n \nConcomitant administration of medicinal products that are known to cause QTc prolongation should \nbe used with caution (see section 4.5). \n \nIn case of concomitant use of agents that may increase panobinostat plasma concentrations, such as \nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitors, dose adjustment is required (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic dysfunction, primarily mild transient elevations in aminotransferases and total bilirubin, has \nbeen reported in patients during treatment with panobinostat. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nLiver function should be monitored prior to treatment and regularly during treatment. If results of liver \nfunction tests show abnormalities according to the NCI-CTEP classification, dose adjustments for \npatients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment are recommended and the patient should be \nfollowed until values return to normal or pre-treatment levels. Panobinostat should not be administered \nin patients with severe hepatic impairment due to lack of experience and safety data in this population. \nAdjustment of bortezomib dose should also be considered (see bortezomib SmPC and Table 6). \n \nElderly population \n \nIt is recommended to monitor patients over 65 years of age more frequently, especially for \nthrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.8 and section 4.2). \n \nFor patients >75 years of age, depending on the patient\u2019s general condition and concomitant diseases, \nan adjustment of the starting doses or schedule of the components of the combination regimen may be \nconsidered (see section 4.2). \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inducers \n \nStrong inducers may reduce the efficacy of panobinostat, therefore the concomitant use of strong \nCYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, \nrifampicin and St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential taking panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and \ndexamethasone must use highly effective contraception for three months after stopping treatment (see \nsections 4.5 and 4.6 and bortezomib and dexamethasone SmPC). Women using hormonal \ncontraceptives should additionally use a barrier method of contraception. \n \nHypothyroidism \n \nHypothyroidism events were reported in 8 of 381 patients treated with panobinostat + bortezomib + \ndexamethasone in Study D2308, of whom 2 required treatment. Thyroid and pituitary function should \nbe monitored by measuring hormone levels (e.g. free T4 and TSH) as clinically indicated (see \nsection 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFarydak metabolism is through both non-CYP and CYP mediated routes. Approximately 40% of \npanobinostat is metabolised through CYP3A4. Metabolism via CYP2D6 and 2C19 was minor. \nTherefore, medicinal products that can influence CYP3A4 enzyme activity may alter the \npharmacokinetics of panobinostat. Panobinostat is a P-gp substrate. \n \nAgents that may increase panobinostat plasma concentrations \n \nCo-administration of a single 20 mg panobinostat dose with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of panobinostat by 1.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared to when \npanobinostat was given alone. \n \nIn patients who take concomitant medicinal products which are strong CYP3A and/or Pgp inhibitors, \nincluding, but not limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin, posaconazole and nefazodone, the dose of panobinostat should be reduced (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nPatients should be instructed to avoid star fruit, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, pomegranates and \npomegranate juice, as these are known to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A enzymes and may increase the \nbioavailability of panobinostat. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nAgents that are predicted to decrease panobinostat concentrations \n \nThe panobinostat fraction metabolised through CYP3A4 is approximately 40%. In clinical studies in \nmultiple myeloma, the exposure of panobinostat was decreased by approximately 20% by the \nconcomitant use of dexamethasone, which is a dose-dependent mild/moderate CYP3A4 inducer. \nStrong inducers are expected to have greater effects, and may reduce the efficacy of panobinostat, \ntherefore the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited to, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum \nperforatum), should be avoided. \n \nAgents whose plasma concentrations may be increased by panobinostat \n \nPanobinostat increased the Cmax and the AUC of dextromethorphan (a substrate of CYP2D6) by \n1.8- and 1.6-fold, respectively, and it cannot be excluded that the effect may be larger on a more \nsensitive CYP2D6 substrate. Avoid panobinostat use in patients who are taking CYP2D6 substrates \nwith a narrow therapeutic index (including, but not limited to, pimozide). When Farydak is \nco-administered with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. atomoxetine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, \nnebivolol, perphenazine and pimozide), dose titrate individual CYP2D6 substrates based on \ntolerability and frequently monitor patients for adverse reactions. \n \nAgents whose plasma exposure can be decreased by panobinostat \n \nHormonal contraceptives \nIt is currently unknown whether panobinostat may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal \ncontraceptives. In addition, when panobinostat is administered together with dexamethasone, which is \nknown to be a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the \nrisk for reduced efficacy of contraceptives needs to be considered. Women using hormonal \ncontraceptives should additionally use a barrier method of contraception. \n \nNo data is available that can be used to exclude the risk that panobinostat could be a weak inducer of \nthe enzyme CYP3A4 in the gastrointestinal tract. This could potentially lead to slightly decreased \nexposure to sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. \n \nAnticipated pharmacodynamic interactions \n \nProlongation of QT interval \nBased on preclinical and clinical data, panobinostat has the potential to prolong the QT interval. \nConcomitant use of anti-arrhythmic medicinal products (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, \ndisopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol) and other substances that are known to prolong the \nQT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, \nmoxifloxacin, bepridil and pimozide) is not recommended. Anti-emetic medicinal products with a \nknown risk of QT prolongation such as dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron and tropisetron should be \nused with caution (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nBased on findings in animals, the likelihood of panobinostat increasing the risk of both foetal death \nand developmental skeletal abnormalities when administered to pregnant women is predicted to be \nhigh. Women of child-bearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to the initiation of \ntreatment with Farydak and must use a highly effective method of contraception during treatment and \nfor three months after the last dose of Farydak. Women using hormonal contraceptives should \nadditionally use a barrier method of contraception. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nDue to its cytostatic/cytotoxic mode of action, panobinostat can influence the quality of sperm formed \nduring treatment. Sexually active men taking Farydak and their female partners should use a highly \neffective method of contraception during the man\u2019s treatment and for six months after his last dose of \nFarydak. \n \nWhen panobinostat is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to \nmoderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy \nof hormonal contraceptives needs to be considered. In addition, it is currently unknown whether \npanobinostat may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using \nhormonal contraceptives should additionally use a barrier method of contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no clinical studies on the use of Farydak in pregnant patients. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive and embryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Given panobinostat\u2019s cytostatic/cytotoxic \nmode of action, the potential risk to the foetus is high. Farydak should only be used during pregnancy \nif the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks to the foetus. If it is used during pregnancy or if \nthe patient becomes pregnant while using it, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the \nfoetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether panobinostat is excreted in human milk. Given its cytostatic/cytotoxic mode of \naction, breast-feeding is contraindicated during Farydak treatment (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nBased on non-clinical findings, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Farydak (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFarydak has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur \nfollowing administration of Farydak (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety data of panobinostat have been assessed from a total of 451 patients with multiple myeloma \ntreated with panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone and from a total of \n278 patients treated with panobinostat as a single agent. \n \nThe safety data reported below are based on the phase III clinical study (Panorama 1) in 381 patients \nwith multiple myeloma treated with 20 mg panobinostat once a day three times per week, on a \n2 weeks on and 1 week off dosing regimen in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. \nThe median duration of exposure in the study was 5.0 months. 15.7% of patients were exposed to \nstudy treatment for \u226548 weeks. \n \nThe most common non-haematological adverse reactions were diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and \nvomiting. \n \nTreatment-emergent haematological toxicities included thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia and \nlymphopenia. \n \nQTcF >480 and <500 msec was recorded in 1.3% of patients and change from baseline of >60 msec \nwas observed in 0.8% of patients. No patient had an absolute QTcF >500 msec. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nCardiac events (most frequently atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, palpitation and sinus tachycardia) were \nreported in 17.6% of panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone-treated patients versus 9.8% of \nplacebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone-treated patients and syncope events were reported in 6.0% \nversus 2.4%, respectively. \n \nDiscontinuation due to adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 36.2% of patients. The \nmost common adverse events (AEs) leading to treatment discontinuation were diarrhoea (4.5%), \nasthenia and fatigue (2.9% each) and pneumonia (1.3%). \n \nOn-treatment deaths not due to the study indication (multiple myeloma) were reported in 6.8% of \npanobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone-treated patients versus 3.2% of placebo + bortezomib + \ndexamethasone-treated patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse drug reactions from clinical studies \n \nAdverse drug reactions from the phase III study (Panorama 1) are shown in Table 7. Adverse drug \nreactions are listed according to system organ classes in MedDRA. Within each system organ class, \nthe adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In \naddition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the \nfollowing convention (CIOMS III): very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data). \n \nTable 7 includes adverse drug reactions that occur due to the addition of panobinostat to the \nbortezomib and dexamethasone combination. The frequency category reflects the combination of all \nthe medicinal products i.e. panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone. For adverse drug reactions \nthat are related to bortezomib or dexamethasone treatment, please refer to the relevant SmPC. \n \nTable 7 Panobinostat adverse drug reactions observed in multiple myeloma patients in the \n\nphase III study \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations Very common Upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia \n\nCommon Septic shock, urinary tract infection, viral \ninfection, oral herpes, Clostridium difficile \ncolitis, otitis media, cellulitis, sepsis, \ngastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infection, \ncandidiasis \n\nUncommon Pneumonia fungal, hepatitis B, aspergillosis \nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders a \n\nVery common Pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, \nleukopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia \n\nEndocrine disorders Common Hypothyroidism \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common Decreased appetite, hypophosphataemia a, \nhyponatraemia a, hypokalaemia a \n\nCommon Hyperglycaemia, dehydration, \nhypoalbuminaemia, fluid retention, \nhyperuricaemia, hypocalcaemia, \nhypomagnesaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders Very common Insomnia \nNervous system disorders Very common Dizziness, headache \n\nCommon Haemorrhage intracranial, syncope, tremor, \ndysgeusia \n\nEye disorders Common Conjunctival haemorrhage \n\n\n\n15 \n\nCardiac disorders Common Bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, \ntachycardia, palpitation \n\nUncommon Myocardial infarction \nVascular disorders Very common Hypotension \n\nCommon Hypertension, haematoma, orthostatic \nhypotension \n\nUncommon Shock haemorrhagic \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery common Cough, dyspnoea \nCommon Respiratory failure, rales, wheezing, epistaxis \nUncommon Pulmonary haemorrhage, haemoptysis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, \ndyspepsia \n\nCommon Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, haematochezia, \ngastritis, cheilitis, abdominal distension, dry \nmouth, flatulence \n\nUncommon Colitis, haematemesis, gastrointestinal pain \nHepatobiliary disorders Common Hepatic function abnormal, \n\nhyperbilirubinaemia a \nSkin and subcutaneous \ndisorders \n\nCommon Skin lesions, rash, erythema \nUncommon Petechiae \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Joint swelling \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\nCommon Renal failure, haematuria, urinary incontinence \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Fatigue, oedema peripheral, pyrexia, asthenia \nCommon Chills, malaise \n\nInvestigations Very common Weight decreased \nCommon Blood urea increased, glomerular filtration rate \n\ndecreased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, \nelectrocardiogram QT prolonged, blood \ncreatinine increased a, SGPT alanine \ntransaminase (ALT) increased a, SGOT aspartate \ntransaminase (AST) increased a \n\na Frequency is based on laboratory values \n \nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n \nGastrointestinal \nGastrointestinal toxicity, primarily diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, is among the most frequently \nreported adverse reactions. However, treatment discontinuation due to these reactions was reported in \na relatively small proportion of patients, with diarrhoea at 4.5% and nausea and vomiting at 0.5% \neach. Patients should be advised to contact their physician if severe gastrointestinal toxicity occurs and \ndose adjustment or discontinuation may be required (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombocytopenia \nDue to the nature of multiple myeloma and the known haematotoxicity for panobinostat and its \ncombination agent bortezomib, thrombocytopenia, often severe, has been frequently observed. CTC \ngrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 256 patients, with a median onset time of one month. \nHowever, thrombocytopenia is reversible (median time to recovery of 12 days) and can usually be \nmanaged by dose adjustment and interruption with or without platelet transfusion (see section 4.4). \n33.3% patients in the panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm and 10.3% patients in the \nplacebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm received platelet transfusions during treatment. \n \nThrombocytopenia rarely leads to treatment discontinuation (1.6% of patients). Most patients with \nthrombocytopenia did not experience haemorrhage. 20.7% of patients experienced haemorrhage, most \n\n\n\n16 \n\nfrequently epistaxis (4.7%), haematoma (2.6%), and conjunctival haemorrhage (2.1%). CTC grade 3 \nor 4 haemorrhage was reported in 4.2% of patients, mostly commonly involving gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage. Five patients (1.3%) died of events associated with haemorrhage. Amongst the patients \nwho died of haemorrhage, one patient had thrombocytopenia grade 4, three patients had \nthrombocytopenia grade 3 and 1 patient had thrombocytopenia grade 1. \n \nNeutropenia \nNeutropenia was frequently reported on the basis of laboratory findings determined during the study \n(all grades: 75%). Most newly occurring severe neutropenia was grade 3 (28%), with considerably \nfewer cases of grade 4 (6.6%). While many patients developed neutropenia, febrile neutropenia only \noccurred in a fraction of treated patients (1.0%, both for CTC all grades and for grades 3 and 4). \nPatients with neutropenia are prone to infection, mostly upper respiratory tract infection or pneumonia. \nOnly 0.3% of the patients were discontinued from the treatment due to neutropenia. \n \nFatigue and asthenia \nFatigue and asthenia were reported in 41.2% and 22.0% of patients, respectively. CTC grade 3 fatigue \nwas reported in 15.7% of the patients, and grade 4 in 1.3%. Grade 3 asthenia was observed in 9.4% of \nthe patients, with no patients experiencing asthenia at CTC grade 4. The treatment was discontinued in \n2.9% of patients due to fatigue and asthenia. \n \nInfections \nRelapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients are at risk of infections. Potential contributing \nfactors may include prior history of chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, the nature of the disease and \nneutropenia or lymphopenia associated with Farydak treatment. The most frequently reported \ninfections include upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia and nasopharyngitis. Fatalities \ninvolving either pneumonia or sepsis were reported. Treatment discontinuation due to infections was \nreported in 5% of patients. \n \nQT prolongation and ECG abnormalities \nQTc prolongation was observed and was mostly mild in degree: QTcF interval >450 msec and \n\u2264480 msec was reported in 10.8% of patients, with maximum increase from baseline >30 msec and \n\u226460 msec in 14.5% of patients. QTcF >500 msec was not reported in any patient. \n \nECG (electrocardiogram) abnormalities have been reported in patients treated with panobinostat + \nbortezomib + dexamethasone, mainly involving ST-T depression (21.7%) and T wave changes \n(39.6%). Regardless of events chronology, syncope was reported in 9% of patients with ST-T \ndepression and 7.2% of patients with T wave change and 4.9% of patients with neither of these ECG \nabnormalities. Likewise ischaemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction and ischaemia) were \nreported in 4.5% of patients with ST-T depression and 4.8% of patients with T wave change and 2.7% \nof patients with neither of these ECG abnormalities. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nThe incidence of deaths not related to study indication was 8.8% in patients \u226565 years of age \ncompared to 5.4% in patients <65 years of age. \n \nAdverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 30%, 44% and 47% of patients \naged <65 years, 65-75 years and \u226575 years, respectively. Grade 3-4 events more frequently observed \nin patients included the following (percentages presented for patients <65 years, 65-75 years and \n\u226575 years of age, respectively): thrombocytopenia (60%, 74%, and 91%), anaemia (16%, 17% and \n29%), diarrhoea (21%, 27% and 47%), and fatigue (18%, 28% and 47%). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n17 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with overdose has been reported during clinical studies. Adverse reactions \nobserved were consistent with the safety profile, with events primarily involving haematological and \ngastrointestinal disorders such as thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and \nanorexia. Cardiac monitoring and assessment of electrolytes and platelet counts should be undertaken \nand supportive care given as necessary in the event of overdose. It is not known whether panobinostat \nis dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX42 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFarydak is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDACs at \nnanomolar concentrations. HDACs catalyse the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of \nhistones and some non-histone proteins. Inhibition of HDAC activity results in increased acetylation \nof histone proteins, an epigenetic alteration that results in a relaxing of chromatin, leading to \ntranscriptional activation. In vitro, panobinostat caused the accumulation of acetylated histones and \nother proteins, inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. Increased levels \nof acetylated histones were observed in xenografts from mice that were treated with panobinostat. \nPanobinostat shows more cytotoxicity towards tumour cells compared to normal cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nTreatment of tumour cells with panobinostat resulted in a dose-dependent increase in acetylation of \nhistones H3 and H4 both in vitro and in xenograft animal pre-clinical models, demonstrating target \ninhibition. In addition, increased expression of the tumour suppressor gene p21CDKNIA (cyclin \ndependent kinase inhibitor 1/p21) gene, a key mediator of G1 arrest and differentiation, was triggered \nwith panobinostat exposure. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical efficacy in patients with relapsed and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma \n(Study D2308 \u2013 Panorama 1) \nThe efficacy and safety of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone were \nevaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III study in patients \nwith relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1-3 prior lines of \ntherapies. \n \nPatients received panobinostat (20 mg taken orally once a day, three times per week, on a 2 weeks on \nand 1 week off dosing regimen), in combination with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 injected intravenously) \nand dexamethasone (20 mg). Treatment was administered for a maximum of 16 cycles (see Tables 1 \nand 2). \n \nA total of 768 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the panobinostat + bortezomib + \ndexamethasone (n=387) or the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone (n=381) arm, stratified by prior \nuse of bortezomib [Yes (n=336 (43.8%)), No (n=432 (56.3%))] and number of prior lines of \nanti-myeloma therapy [1 prior line (n=352 (45.8%)), 2 to 3 prior lines (n=416 (54.2%))]. \nDemographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\narms. \n \nThe median age was 63 years, range 28-84; 42.1% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of \n53.0% of patients were male. Caucasians comprised 65.0% of the study population, Asians 30.2% and \nblacks 2.9%. ECOG performance status was 0-1 in 93% of patients. The median number of prior \ntherapies was 1.0. More than half (57.2%) of the patients had undergone prior stem cell transplantation \nand 62.8% of the patients were relapsed after previous anti-neoplastic therapies (e.g. melphalan \n79.6%, dexamethasone 81.1%, thalidomide 51.2%, cyclophosphamide 45.3%, bortezomib 43.0%, \ncombined bortezomib and dexamethasone 37.8%, lenalidomide 20.4%). More than one third (35.8%) \nof the patients were relapsed and refractory to prior treatment. \n \nThe median duration of follow-up was 28.75 months in the panobinostat + bortezomib + \ndexamethasone arm and 29.04 months in the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm. \n \nThe primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) as per modified European Bone Marrow \nTransplant Group (mEBMT) criteria and as assessed by the investigator. In the overall patient \npopulation PFS based on the full analysis set (FAS) was statistically significantly different between \nthe treatment arms (stratified Log-rank test p<0.0001, with an estimated 37% risk reduction in the \npanobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm compared to the placebo + bortezomib + \ndexamethasone arm (Hazard ratio: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.76)). The median PFS (95% CI) was \n12.0 months (10.3, 12.9) and 8.1 months (7.6, 9.2), respectively. \n \nOverall survival (OS) was the key secondary endpoint. OS was not statistically significantly different \nbetween the two treatment groups. The median OS was 40.3 months in the panobinostat + bortezomib \n+ dexamethasone arm and 35.8 months in the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm (Hazard \nratio: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.14)). \n \nOut of the pre-specified subgroup of patients with prior treatment with bortezomib and an \nimmunomodulatory agent (N=193), 76% of patients had received at least two prior regimens. In this \nsubset of patients (N=147), the median duration of treatment was 4.5 months in the panobinostat + \nbortezomib + dexamethasone arm and 4.8 months in the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm. \nThe median PFS (95% CI) was 12.5 months (7.26, 14.03) in the panobinostat + bortezomib + \ndexamethasone arm and 4.7 months (3.71, 6.05) in the placebo + bortezomib + and dexamethasone \narm [HR: 0.47 (0.31, 0.72)]. These patients had a median of 3 prior therapies.

The majority of patients had received prior transplant (63.6%). \n \nThe median duration of exposure to study treatment was 4.6 months (range: 0.1-24.1 months). Patients \nachieved an ORR (\u2265PR (partial response)) of 34.5% and 52.7% (\u2265MR (minimal response)). The \nmedian time to response was 1.4 months and the median duration of response was 6.0 months. The \nmedian OS was 17.5 months. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFarydak in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nPanobinostat is rapidly and almost completely absorbed with Tmax reached within 2 hours of oral \nadministration in patients with advanced cancer. The absolute oral bioavailability of panobinostat was \napproximately 21%. After oral administration, panobinostat pharmacokinetics appear to be linear in \nthe dose range 10-30 mg, but AUC increases less than proportionally with dose at higher doses. \n \nOverall panobinostat exposure and inter-patient variability remained unchanged with or without food, \nwhereas Cmax was reduced by <45% and Tmax prolonged by 1 to 2.5 hours with food (i.e. both normal \nand high-fat breakfasts). Since food did not alter overall bioavailability (AUC), panobinostat can be \nadministered regardless of food in cancer patients. \n \nDistribution \n \nPanobinostat is moderately (approximately 90%) bound to human plasma proteins. Its fraction in the \nerythrocyte is 0.60 in vitro, independent of the concentration. The volume of distribution of \npanobinostat at steady state (Vss) is approximately 1,000 litres based on final parameter estimates in \nthe population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPanobinostat is extensively metabolised, and a large fraction of the dose is metabolised before \nreaching the systemic circulation. Pertinent metabolic pathways involved in the biotransformation of \npanobinostat are reduction, hydrolysis, oxidation and glucuronidation processes. Oxidative \nmetabolism of panobinostat played a less prominent role, with approximately 40% of the dose \neliminated by this pathway. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the main oxidation enzyme, with \npotential minor involvement of CYP2D6 and 2C19. \n \nPanobinostat represented 6 to 9% of the drug-related exposure in plasma. The parent substance is \ndeemed to be responsible for the overall pharmacological activity of panobinostat. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter a single oral dose of [14C] panobinostat in patients, 29 to 51% of administered radioactivity is \nexcreted in the urine and 44 to 77% in the faeces. Unchanged panobinostat accounted for <2.5% of the \ndose in urine and <3.5% of the dose in faeces. The remainders are metabolites. Apparent panobinostat \nrenal clearance (CLR/F) was found to range from 2.4 to 5.5 l/h. Panobinostat has a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of approximately 37 hours based on final parameters estimate in the population PK analysis. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nPanobinostat was not evaluated in multiple myeloma patients under 18 years of age. \n \nElderly population \nIn the phase III clinical study 162 out of 387 patients were aged 65 years or over. Plasma exposure of \npanobinostat in patients aged 65 years or younger was similar to those older than 65 years in the \npooling of single-agent panobinostat studies between the dose range of 10 mg and 80 mg. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat was evaluated in a phase I \nstudy, in 24 patients with solid tumours and with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Mild and \nmoderate hepatic impairment as per NCI-CTEP classification increased panobinostat plasma exposure \nby 43% and 105%, respectively. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat was assessed in a phase I \nstudy in 37 patients with advanced solid tumours with varying degrees of renal function. Mild, \nmoderate and severe renal impairment based on baseline urinary creatinine clearance did not increase \nthe panobinostat plasma exposure in mild, moderate and severe groups. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies \n \nThe primary target organs of toxicity following administration of panobinostat in rats and dogs were \nidentified as the erythropoietic, myelopoietic and lymphatic systems. The thyroid changes including \nhormones in dogs (decrease triodothyronine (T3)) and rats (decrease in triodothyronine (T3), \ntetraiodothyronine (T4) (males) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)) were observed at exposures \ncorresponding to 0.07-2.2 of the human AUC observed clinically. \n \nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis \n \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with panobinostat. Panobinostat has demonstrated \nmutagenic potential in the Ames assay, endo reduplication effects in human peripheral blood \nlymphocytes in vitro. Additionally, in vivo DNA damage was observed in a COMET study in mouse \nlymphoma L5178Y cells and a dose-dependent molecular mechanisms study in murine bone marrow \ncells. The in vitro and in vivo findings are attributed to the pharmacological mode of action. \n \n \nReproduction toxicity \n \nAn increase in early resorptions was observed in female rats (doses \u226530 mg/kg). Prostatic atrophy \naccompanied by reduced secretory granules, testicular degeneration, oligospermia and increased \nepididymal debris were observed in dogs at exposures corresponding to 0.41-0.69 of the human \nclinical AUC and not fully reversible after a 4 week recovery period. \n \nBased on animal data, the likelihood of panobinostat increasing the risk of foetal death and \ndevelopmental skeletal abnormalities is predicted to be high. Embryo foetal lethality and increases in \nskeletal anomalies (extra sternabrae, extra ribs, increases in minor skeletal variations, delayed \nossification and variations of the sternabrae) were seen above exposures corresponding to 0.25 of the \nhuman clinical AUC. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nThe effects of panobinostat on labour and post-natal growth and maturation were not evaluated in \nanimal studies. \n \n \n6.
