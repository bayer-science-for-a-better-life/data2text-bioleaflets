CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPROCYSBI is indicated for the treatment of proven nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine reduces \ncystine accumulation in some cells (e.g. leukocytes, muscle and liver cells) of nephropathic cystinosis \npatients and, when treatment is started early, it delays the development of renal failure. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPROCYSBI treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of cystinosis.\nCysteamine therapy must be initiated promptly once the diagnosis is confirmed (i.e., increased WBC \ncystine) to achieve maximum benefit.\n\nPosology\n\nWhite blood cell (WBC) cystine concentration may for instance be measured by a number of different \ntechniques such as specific WBC subsets (e.g., granulocyte assay) or the mixed leukocyte assay with \neach assay having different target values. Healthcare professionals should refer to the assay-specific \ntherapeutic targets provided by individual testing laboratories when making decisions regarding \ndiagnosis and PROCYSBI dosing for cystinosis patients. For example the therapeutic goal is to \nmaintain a WBC cysteine level < 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed \nleukocyte assay), 30 min after dosing For patients adherent to a stable dose of PROCYSBI, and who \ndo not have easy access to an adequate facility for measuring their WBC cystine, the goal of therapy \nshould be to maintain plasma cysteamine concentration > 0.1 mg/L, 30 min after dosing.\n\n\n\n3\n\nMeasurement timing: PROCYSBI should be administered every 12 hours. The determination of WBC \ncystine and/or plasma cysteamine must be obtained 12.5 hours after the evening dose the day before, \nand therefore 30 minutes after the following morning dose is given.\n\nTransferring patients from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate hard capsules \nPatients with cystinosis taking immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate may be transferred to a total \ndaily dose of PROCYSBI equal to their previous total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine \nbitartrate. Total daily dose should be divided by two and administered every 12 hours. The maximum \nrecommended dose of cysteamine is 1.95 g/m2/day. The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4).\nPatients being transferred from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate to PROCYSBI should have \ntheir WBC cystine levels measured in 2 weeks, and thereafter every 3 months to assess optimal dose \nas described above.\n\nNewly diagnosed adult patients\nNewly diagnosed adult patients should be started on 1/6 to 1/4 of the targeted maintenance dose of \nPROCYSBI. The targeted maintenance dose is 1.3 g/m2/day, in two divided doses, given every \n12 hours. The dose should be raised if there is adequate tolerance and the WBC cystine level \nremains > 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed leukocyte assay). The \nmaximum recommended dose of cysteamine is 1.95 g/m2/day. The use of doses higher than \n1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.4). \nThe target values provided in the SmPC are obtained from using the mixed leucocyte assay. It should \nbe noted that therapeutic targets for cystine depletion are assay-specific and different assays have \nspecific treatment targets. Therefore, healthcare professionals should refer to the assay-specific \ntherapeutic targets provided by individual testing laboratories.\n\nNewly diagnosed paediatric population\nThe targeted maintenance dose of 1.3 g/m2/day can be approximated according to the following table, \nwhich takes surface area as well as weight into consideration. \n\nWeight in kilograms Recommended dose in mgEvery 12 hours*\n0\u20135 200\n5\u201310 300\n11\u201315 400\n16\u201320 500\n21\u201325 600\n26\u201330 700\n31\u201340 800\n41\u201350 900\n> 50 1000\n\n* Higher dose may be required to achieve target WBC cystine concentration. \nThe use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPatients with poor tolerability\nPatients with poorer tolerability still receive significant benefit if white blood cell cystine levels are \nbelow 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed leukocyte assay). The \ncysteamine dose can be increased to a maximum of 1.95 g/m2/day to achieve this level. The dose of \n1.95 g/m2/day of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate has been associated with an increased rate of \nwithdrawal from treatment due to intolerance and an increased incidence of adverse events. If \ncysteamine is initially poorly tolerated due to gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms or transient skin \nrashes, therapy should be temporarily stopped, then re-instituted at a lower dose and gradually \nincreased to the appropriate dose (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n4\n\nPatients on dialysis or post-transplantation \nExperience has occasionally shown that some forms of cysteamine are less well tolerated (i.e. leading \nto more adverse events) when patients are on dialysis. A closer monitoring of the WBC cystine levels \nis recommended in these patients.  \n\nPatients with renal impairment\nDose adjustment is not normally required; however, WBC cystine levels should be monitored.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \nDose adjustment is not normally required; however, WBC cystine levels should be monitored.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis medicinal product can be administered by swallowing the intact capsules as well as sprinkling the \ncapsule contents (enteric coated beads) on food or delivery through a gastric feeding tube.\nDo not crush or chew capsules or capsule contents.\n\nMissed doses\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. If it is within four hours of the next dose, \nskip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not double the dose. \n\nAdministration with food\nCysteamine bitartrate can be administered with an acidic fruit juice or water.\nCysteamine bitartrate should not be administered with food rich in fat or proteins, or with frozen food \nlike ice-cream. Patients should try to consistently avoid meals and dairy products for at least 1 hour \nbefore and 1 hour after PROCYSBI dosing. If fasting during this period is not possible, it is acceptable \nto eat only a small amount (\uf07e 100 grams) of food (preferentially carbohydrates) during the hour before \nand after PROCYSBI administration. It is important to dose PROCYSBI in relation to food intake in a \nconsistent and reproducible way over time (see section 5.2)\nIn paediatric patients who are at risk of aspiration, aged approximately 6 years and under, the hard \ncapsules should be opened and the content sprinkled on food or liquid listed below.\n\nSprinkling on food\nCapsules for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled onto \napproximately 100 grams of apple sauce or berry jelly. Gently stir the contents into the soft food, \ncreating a mixture of cysteamine granules and food. The entire amount of the mixture should be eaten. \nThis may be followed by 250 mL of an acceptable acidic liquid - fruit juice (e.g., orange juice or any \nacidic fruit juice) or water. The mixture must be eaten within 2 hours after preparation and must be \nrefrigerated from the time of preparation to the time of administration.\n\nAdministering through feeding tubes\nCapsules for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled onto \napproximately 100 grams of apple sauce or berry jelly. Gently stir the contents into the soft food, \ncreating a mixture of cysteamine granules and the soft food. The mixture should then be administered \nvia gastrostomy tube, nasogastric tube or gastrostomy-jejunostomy tube. The mixture must be \nadministered within 2 hours after preparation and may be refrigerated from the time of preparation to \nthe time of administration. \n\nSprinkling in orange juice or any acidic fruit juice or water\nCapsules for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled into 100 \nto 150 mL of acidic fruit juice or water. Dose administration options are provided below: \n\uf0b7 Option 1 / Syringe: Mix gently for 5 minutes, then aspirate the mixture of cysteamine granules \n\nand acidic fruit juice or water into a dosing syringe.\n\uf0b7 Option 2 / Cup: Mix gently for 5 minutes in a cup or shake gently for 5 minutes in a covered \n\ncup (e.g., \u201csippy\u201d cup). Drink the mixture of cysteamine granules and acidic fruit juice or water.\nThe mixture must be administered (drunk) within 30 minutes after preparation and must be \nrefrigerated from the time of preparation to the time of administration.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, any form of cysteamine (mercaptamine), or to any of \nthe excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to penicillamine.\n\uf0b7 Breast-feeding.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nThe use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.2).\n\nOral cysteamine has not been shown to prevent eye deposition of cystine crystals. Therefore, where \ncysteamine ophthalmic solution is used for that purpose, its usage should continue. \n\nIf a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient \nmust be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine (see section 4.6).\n\nIntact capsules of PROCYSBI should not be administered to children under the age of approximately \n6 years due to risk of aspiration (see section 4.2).\n\nDermatological\n\nThere have been reports of serious skin lesions in patients treated with high doses of immediate-\nrelease cysteamine bitartrate or other cysteamine salts that have responded to cysteamine dose \nreduction. Physicians should routinely monitor the skin and bones of patients receiving cysteamine.\n\nIf skin or bone abnormalities appear, the dose of cysteamine should be reduced or stopped. Treatment \nmay be restarted at a lower dose under close supervision, and then slowly titrated to the appropriate \ntherapeutic dose (see sections 4.2). If a severe skin rash develops such as erythema multiforme bullosa \nor toxic epidermal necrolysis, cysteamine should not be re-administered (see sections 4.8).\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nGI ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine \nbitartrate. Physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding and should inform \npatients and/or guardians about the signs and symptoms of serious GI toxicity and what steps to take if \nthey occur.\n\nGI tract symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain have been associated \nwith cysteamine.\n\nStrictures of the ileo-caecum and large bowel (fibrosing colonopathy) was first described in cystic \nfibrosis patients who were given high doses of pancreatic enzymes in the form of tablets with an \nenteric coating of methacrylic acid - ethyl acrylate copolymer (1:1), one of the excipients in \nPROCYSBI. As a precaution, unusual abdominal symptoms or changes in abdominal symptoms \nshould be medically assessed to exclude the possibility of fibrosing colonopathy.\n\nCentral Nervous System (CNS)\n\nCNS symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been \nassociated with cysteamine. If CNS symptoms develop, the patient should be carefully evaluated and \nthe dose adjusted as necessary. Patients should not engage in potentially hazardous activities until the \neffects of cysteamine on mental performance are known (see section 4.7). \n\n\n\n6\n\nLeukopenia and abnormal liver function\n\nCysteamine has occasionally been associated with reversible leukopenia and abnormal liver function. \nTherefore, blood counts and liver function should be monitored. \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension\n\nThere have been reports of benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri (PTC)) and/or \npapilledema associated with cysteamine bitartrate treatment that has resolved with the addition of \ndiuretic therapy (post-marketing experience with the immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate). \nPhysicians should instruct patients to report any of the following symptoms: headache, tinnitus, \ndizziness, nausea, diplopia, blurred vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye \nmovement. A periodic eye examination is needed to identify this condition early and timely treatment \nshould be provided when it occurs to prevent vision loss. \n\nImportant information about some of the excipients of PROCYSBI\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially sodium-\nfree.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIt cannot be excluded that cysteamine is a clinically relevant inducer of CYP enzymes, inhibitor of \nP-gp and BCRP at the intestinal level and inhibitor of liver uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3 \nand OCT1).\n\nCo-administration with electrolyte and mineral replacement\n\nCysteamine can be administered with electrolyte (except bicarbonate) and mineral replacements \nnecessary for management of Fanconi syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone. \nBicarbonate should be administered at least one hour before or one hour after PROCYSBI to avoid \npotential earlier release of cysteamine.\n\nIndomethacin and cysteamine have been used simultaneously in some patients. In cases of patients \nwith kidney transplants, anti-rejection treatments have been used with cysteamine.\n\nCo-administration of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole and PROCYSBI in vivo showed no effects \non cysteamine bitartrate exposure. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is no adequate data from the use of cysteamine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenesis (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. The effect on pregnancy of untreated cystinosis is also unknown. Therefore, cysteamine \nbitartrate should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, unless clearly \nnecessary (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient \nmust be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nCysteamine excretion in human milk is unknown. However, due to the results of animal studies in \nbreast-feeding females and neonates (see section 5.3), breast-feeding is contra-indicated in women \ntaking PROCYSBI (see section 4.3).\n\n\n\n7\n\nFertility\n\nEffects on fertility have been seen in animal studies (see section 5.3). Azoospermia has been reported \nin male cystinosis patients.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCysteamine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nCysteamine may cause drowsiness. When starting therapy, patients should not engage in potentially \nhazardous activities until the effects of the medicinal product on each individual are known.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nFor the immediate-release formulation of cysteamine bitartrate, approximately 35% of patients can be \nexpected to experience adverse reactions. These mainly involve the gastrointestinal and central \nnervous systems. When these reactions appear at the initiation of cysteamine therapy, temporary \nsuspension and gradual reintroduction of treatment may be effective in improving tolerance.\nIn clinical studies with healthy volunteers, the most frequent adverse reactions were very common GI \nsymptoms (16%) and occurred primarily as single episodes that were mild or moderate in severity. \nThe adverse reactions profile for healthy subjects was similar to the adverse reactions profile in \npatients relative to GI disorders (diarrhoea and abdominal pain). \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:\n\nMedDRA system organ class Frequency: adverse reaction\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders Uncommon: Leukopenia\n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon: Anaphylactic reaction\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Very common: Anorexia\n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon: Nervousness, hallucination\n\nCommon: Headache, encephalopathyNervous system disorders\n\nUncommon: Somnolence, convulsions\nVery common: Vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea\n\nCommon: Abdominal pain, breath odour, dyspepsia, \ngastroenteritis\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nUncommon: Gastrointestinal ulcer\nCommon: Skin odour abnormal, rashSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders\nUncommon: Hair colour changes, skin striae, skin \nfragility (molluscoid pseudotumour on elbows)\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nUncommon: Joint hyperextension, leg pain, genu \nvalgum, osteopenia, compression fracture, scoliosis.\n\n\n\n8\n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon: Nephrotic syndrome\n\nVery common: Lethargy, pyrexiaGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions Common: Asthenia\nInvestigations Common: Liver function tests abnormal\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nClinical studies experience with PROCYSBI\nIn clinical studies comparing PROCYSBI to the immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate, one third of \nthe patients exhibited very common GI disorders (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain). Common \nnervous system disorders (headache, somnolence and lethargy) and common general disorders \n(asthenia) were also seen. \n\nPost-marketing experience with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate\nBenign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri (PTC)) with papilledema; skin lesions, \nmolluscoid pseudotumors, skin striae, skin fragility; joint hyperextension, leg pain, genu valgum, \nosteopenia, compression fracture and scoliosis have been reported with immediate-release cysteamine \nbitartrate (see section 4.4). \n\nTwo cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported within 6 months of starting therapy with \nprogressive recovery after treatment discontinuation. Histology showed a membranous \nglomerulonephritis of the renal allograft in one case and hypersensitivity interstitial nephritis in the \nother.\n\nA few cases of Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome on elbows have been reported in children chronically \ntreated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine chlorhydrate or cystamine or \ncysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. In some cases, these skin lesions \nwere associated with skin striae and bone lesions first seen during an X-ray examination. Bone \ndisorders reported were genu valgum, leg pain and hyperextensive joints, osteopenia, compression \nfractures, and scoliosis. In the few cases where histopathological examination of the skin was \nperformed, the results suggested angioendotheliomatosis. One patient subsequently died of acute \ncerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy. In some patients, the skin lesions on elbows regressed \nafter immediate-release cysteamine dose reduction (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAn overdose of cysteamine may cause progressive lethargy.\n\nShould overdosing occur, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be supported \nappropriately. No specific antidote is known. It is not known if cysteamine is removed by \nhaemodialysis.\n\n\n\n9\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism product, ATC code: A16AA04.\n\nCysteamine is the simplest stable aminothiol and a degradation product of the amino acid cysteine. \nCysteamine participates within lysosomes in a thiol-disulfide interchange reaction converting cystine \ninto cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide, both of which can exit the lysosome in patients \nwith cystinosis.\n\nNormal individuals and persons heterozygous for cystinosis have white blood cell cystine levels of \n< 0.2 and usually below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein, respectively, when measured using the mixed \nleukocyte assay. Individuals with cystinosis have elevations of WBC cystine above \n2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. \n\nWBC cystine is monitored in these patients to determine adequacy of dosing, levels being measured \n30 minutes after dosing when treated with PROCYSBI. \n\nA pivotal phase 3 randomized, crossover PK and PD study (which was also the first ever randomized \nstudy with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate) demonstrated that at steady-state, patients \nreceiving PROCYSBI every 12 hours (Q12H) maintained a comparable depletion of WBC cystine \nlevels compared to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate every 6 hours (Q6H). Forty-three (43) \npatients were randomized; twenty-seven (27) children (ages 6 to 12 years old), fifteen (15) adolescents \n(ages 12 to 21 years old) and one (1) adult with cystinosis and with native kidney function based on an \nestimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) (corrected for body surface area) > 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 \nwere randomized. Of those forty-three (43) patients, two (2) siblings withdrew at the end of the first \ncrossover period, due to a prior planned surgery in one (1) of them; forty-one (41) patients completed \nthe protocol. Two (2) patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis because their WBC \ncystine level increased over 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein during the immediate-release cysteamine \ntreatment period. Thirty-nine (39) patients were included in the final primary per protocol efficacy \nanalysis. \n\nPer \u2013Protocol (PP) Population (N=39)\nImmediate-release \n\ncysteamine bitartrate PROCYSBI\n\nWBC cystine level \n(LS Mean \u00b1 SE) in nmol hemicystine/mg \nprotein*\n\n0.44 \u00b1 0.05 0.51 \u00b1 0.05\n\nTreatment effect\n(LS mean \u00b1 SE; 95.8% CI; p-value) 0.08 \u00b1 0.03; 0.01 to 0.15; <0.0001\n\nAll Evaluable Patients (ITT) Population (N=41)\nImmediate-release \n\ncysteamine bitartrate PROCYSBI\n\nWBC cystine level \n(LS Mean \u00b1 SE) in nmol hemicystine/mg \nprotein*\n\n0.74 \u00b1 0.14 0.53 \u00b1 0.14\n\nTreatment effect \n(LS mean \u00b1 SE; 95.8% CI; p-value) -0.21 \u00b1 0.14; -0.48 to 0.06; <0.001\n\n* measured using the mixed leukocyte assay\n\nForty of forty-one (40/41) patients who completed the pivotal phase 3 study were entered in a \nprospective study with PROCYSBI that stayed open as long as PROCYSBI could not be prescribed by \ntheir treating physician. In this study, the WBC cystine measured using the mixed leukocyte assay was \nalways on average under optimal control at < 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. The estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not change for the study population over time. \n\n\n\n10\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe relative bioavailability is about 125% as compared to immediate-release cysteamine.\n\nFood intake reduces the absorption of PROCYSBI at 30 minutes pre-dose (approximately 35% \ndecrease in exposure) and at 30 min post-dose (approximately 16 or 45% decrease in exposure for \nintact and open capsules respectively). Food intake two hours after administration did not affect the \nabsorption of PROCYSBI. \n\nDistribution\n\nThe in vitro plasma protein binding of cysteamine, primarily to albumin, is approximately 54% and \nindependent of plasma drug concentration over the therapeutic range. \n\nBiotransformation\n\nThe elimination of unchanged cysteamine in the urine has been shown to range between 0.3% and \n1.7% of the total daily dose in four patients; the bulk of cysteamine is excreted as sulphate.\n\nIn vitro data suggests that cysteamine bitartrate is likely to be metabolized by multiple CYP enzymes, \nincluding CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP2A6 and \nCYP3A4 were not involved in the metabolism of cysteamine bitartrate under the experimental \nconditions. \n\nElimination\n\nThe terminal half-life of cysteamine bitartrate is approximately 4 hours. \n\nCysteamine bitartrate is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in vitro.\n\nIn vitro: Cysteamine bitartrate is a substrate of P-gp and OCT2, but not a substrate of BCRP, \nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1. Cysteamine bitartrate is not an inhibitor of OAT1, \nOAT3 and OCT2. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of cysteamine bitartrate has not been studied in special populations. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn genotoxicity studies published for cysteamine, induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured \neukaryotic cell lines has been reported. Specific studies with cysteamine did not show any mutagenic \neffects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in the mouse micronucleus test. A bacterial reverse \nmutation assay study (\u201cAmes test\u201d) was performed with the cysteamine bitartrate used for PROCYSBI \nand cysteamine bitartrate did not show any mutagenic effects in this test.\n\nReproduction studies showed embryo-foetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in \nrats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic \neffects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis \nat a dose of 100 mg/kg/day.\n\nThis is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is slightly less than the recommended clinical \nmaintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.3 g/m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at \n375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival \n\n\n\n11\n\nof the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of \nlactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the drug inhibit prolactin secretion in animals.\n\nAdministration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts.\n\nHigh doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice \nbut not in monkeys. Experimental administration of the drug causes depletion of somatostatin in \nseveral animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the drug is unknown.\n\nNo carcinogenic studies have been conducted with cysteamine bitartrate gastro-resistant hard capsules.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What PROCYSBI is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take PROCYSBI \n3. How to take PROCYSBI \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store PROCYSBI\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What PROCYSBI is and what it is used for\n\nPROCYSBI contains the active substance cysteamine (also known as mercaptamine) and is taken for \nthe treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in children and adults. Cystinosis is a disease affecting how \nthe body functions, with an abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine in various organs of the \nbody such as the kidney, eye, muscle, pancreas, and brain. Cystine build-up causes kidney damage and \nexcretion of excess amounts of glucose, proteins, and electrolytes. Different organs are affected at \ndifferent ages.\n\nPROCYSBI is a medicine that reacts with cystine to decrease its level within the cells. Cysteamine \ntherapy should be initiated promptly after confirmation of the diagnosis of cystinosis to achieve \nmaximum benefit.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take PROCYSBI\n\nDo not take PROCYSBI:\n\uf02d If you are allergic to cysteamine (also known as mercaptamine) or any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\uf02d If you are allergic to penicillamine.\n\uf02d If you are breast-feeding.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PROCYSBI.\n\n\uf02d Since oral cysteamine doesn\u2019t prevent deposits of cystine crystals in the eye, you should \ncontinue taking cysteamine eye drops as prescribed by your doctor. \n\n\uf02d Whole cysteamine capsules should not be given to children under the age of 6 years due to the \nrisk of choking (refer to section 3 How to take PROCYSBI \u2013 Method of administration).\n\n\n\n28\n\n\uf02d Serious skin lesions can occur in patients treated with high doses of cysteamine. Your doctor \nwill routinely monitor your skin and bones and reduce or stop your treatment if needed (see \nsection 4).\n\n\uf02d Stomach and intestinal ulcers and bleeding can occur in patients receiving cysteamine (see \nsection 4). \n\n\uf02d Other intestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and stomach ache can occur \nwith cysteamine. Your doctor may interrupt and change your dose if these occur. \n\n\uf02d Talk to your doctor if you have any unusual stomach symptoms or changes in stomach \nsymptoms.\n\n\uf02d Symptoms such as seizures, tiredness, sleepiness, depression, and brain disorders \n(encephalopathy) can occur with cysteamine. If such symptoms develop, tell your doctor who \nwill adjust your dose.\n\n\uf02d Abnormal liver function or reduced white blood cell count (leukopenia) can occur with use of \ncysteamine. Your doctor will routinely monitor your blood counts and liver function.\n\n\uf02d Your doctor will monitor you for benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri \n(PTC)) and/or swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema) associated with cysteamine treatment. \nYou will receive regular eye examinations to identify this condition as early treatment can \nprevent vision loss.\n\nOther medicines and PROCYSBI\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. If your doctor prescribes bicarbonate, do not take it at the same time as PROCYSBI; take \nbicarbonate at least one hour before or at least one hour after the medicine.\n\nPROCYSBI with food and drink\nFor at least 1 hour before and 1 hour after taking PROCYSBI try to avoid meals, which are rich in fat \nor proteins as well as any food or liquid that could decrease the acidity in your stomach, like milk or \nyogurt. If this is not possible, you can eat a small amount (about 100 grams) of food (preferably \ncarbohydrates e.g. bread, pasta, fruits) during the hour before and after taking PROCYSBI. \nTake the capsule with an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or water. For children \nand patients who have problems to swallow, please refer to section 3 How to take PROCYSBI \u2013 \nMethod of administration.\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should not use this medicine if you are pregnant, particularly during the first trimester. If you are \na woman planning a pregnancy or become pregnant, seek immediate advice from your doctor about \nstopping therapy with this medicine as continued treatment may be harmful to the unborn baby. \n\nDo not use this medicine if you are breastfeeding (see section 2 under \u201cDo not use PROCYSBI\u201d). \n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine may cause some drowsiness. When starting therapy, you should not drive, use \nmachines, or engage in other dangerous activities until you know how the medicine affects you.\n\nPROCYSBI contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u201csodium-\nfree.\u201d \n\n3. How to take PROCYSBI\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\n\n\n29\n\nThe recommended dose for you or your child will depend on your or your child\u2019s age and weight. The \ntargeted maintenance dose is 1.3 g/m2/day.\n\nDosing schedule\nTake this medicine two times a day, every 12 hours.

If this is \nnot possible, you can eat a small amount (about 100 grams) of food (preferably carbohydrates e.g. \nbread, pasta, fruits) during the hour before and after PROCYSBI administration. \n\nIt is important to take PROCYSBI in a consistent way over time.\n\nDo not increase or decrease the amount of medicine without your doctor\u2019s approval.\n\nThe total usual dose should not exceed 1.95 g/m2/day.\n\nDuration of treatment\nTreatment with PROCYSBI should continue life-long, as instructed by your doctor.\n\nMethod of administration\nYou should take this medicine only by mouth.\n\nIn order for this medicine to work correctly, you must do the following:\n- Swallow the whole capsule with an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or \n\nwater. Do not crush or chew capsules or capsule contents. Do not give gastro-resistant hard \ncapsules to children under 6 years of age because they may not be able to swallow them and \nthey may choke. For patients who cannot swallow the whole capsule, the gastro-resistant hard \ncapsule may be opened and the contents may be sprinkled on food (such as apple sauce or berry \njelly) or mixed in with an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or water. \nConsult your child\u2019s doctor for complete directions.\n\n- Your medical treatment may include, in addition to cysteamine, one or more supplements to \nreplace important electrolytes lost through the kidneys. It is important to take these supplements \nexactly as instructed. If several doses of the supplements are missed or weakness or drowsiness \ndevelops, call your doctor for instructions.\n\n- Regular blood tests to measure the amount of cystine inside white blood cells and/or the \nconcentration of cysteamine in the blood are necessary to help determine the correct dose of \nPROCYSBI. You or your doctor will arrange for these blood tests to be performed. These tests \nmust be obtained 12.5 hours after the evening dose the day before, and therefore 30 minutes \nafter the following morning dose is given. Regular blood and urine tests to measure the levels of \nthe body\u2019s important electrolytes are also necessary to help you or your doctor correctly adjust \nthe doses of these supplements.\n\nIf you take more PROCYSBI than you should\nYou should contact your doctor or the hospital emergency department immediately if you have taken \nmore PROCYSBI than you should. You may become drowsy.\n\nIf you forget to take PROCYSBI\nIf you missed a dose of medicine, you should take it as soon as possible. However, if it is within \n4 hours of the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n\n\n30\n\n4.

for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in children and adults. cystinosis is a disease affecting how the body functions, with an abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine in various organs of the body such as the kidney, eye, muscle, pancreas, and brain. cystine build-up causes kidney damage and excretion of excess amounts of glucose, proteins, and electrolytes. different organs are affected at different ages. procysbi is a medicine that reacts with cystine to decrease its level within the cells. cysteamine therapy should be initiated promptly after confirmation of the diagnosis of cystinosis to achieve maximum benefit.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "procysbi", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "procysbi", "Type": "TREATMENT",

cysteamine (also known as mercaptamine) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you are allergic to penicillamine. if you are breast-feeding. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking procysbi. since oral cysteamine doesn't prevent deposits of cystine crystals in the eye, you should continue taking cysteamine eye drops as prescribed by your doctor. whole cysteamine capsules should not be given to children under the age of 6 years due to the risk of choking (refer to section 3 how to take procysbi method of administration). serious skin lesions can occur in patients treated with high doses of cysteamine. your doctor will routinely monitor your skin and bones and reduce or stop your treatment if needed (see section 4). stomach and intestinal ulcers and bleeding can occur in patients receiving cysteamine (see section 4). other intestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and stomach ache can occur with cysteamine. your doctor may interrupt and change your dose if these occur. talk to your doctor if you have any unusual stomach symptoms or changes in stomach symptoms. symptoms such as seizures, tiredness, sleepiness, depression, and brain disorders (encephalopathy) can occur with cysteamine. if such symptoms develop, tell your doctor who will adjust your dose. abnormal liver function or reduced white blood cell count (leukopenia) can occur with use of cysteamine. your doctor will routinely monitor your blood counts and liver function. your doctor will monitor you for benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri (ptc)) and/or swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema) associated with cysteamine treatment. you will receive regular eye examinations to identify this condition as early treatment can prevent vision loss. other medicines and procysbi tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. if your doctor prescribes bicarbonate, do not take it at the same time as procysbi; take bicarbonate at least one hour before or at least one hour after the medicine. procysbi with food and
