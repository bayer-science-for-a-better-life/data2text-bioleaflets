Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRAVICTI 1.1 g/ml oral liquid \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of liquid contains 1.1 g of glycerol phenylbutyrate. This corresponds to a density of 1.1 g/ml. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral liquid. \nClear, colourless to pale yellow liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRAVICTI is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy for chronic management of patients with urea \ncycle disorders (UCDs) including deficiencies of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS), ornithine \ncarbamoyltransferase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), \narginase I (ARG) and ornithine translocase deficiency hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia \nhomocitrullinuria syndrome (HHH) who cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or \namino acid supplementation alone.  \nRAVICTI must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (e.g., \nessential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, protein-free calorie supplements).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRAVICTI should be prescribed by a physician experienced in the management of UCDs.  \n \nPosology \n \nRAVICTI must be used with dietary protein restriction and sometimes dietary supplements (e.g., \nessential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, protein-free calorie supplements) depending on the daily \ndietary protein intake needed to promote growth and development. \n \nThe daily dose should be individually adjusted according to the patient\u2019s protein tolerance and the \ndaily dietary protein intake needed. \n \nRAVICTI therapy may be required life long unless orthotopic liver transplantation is elected.  \n \nAdults and children  \nThe recommended dose for patients na\u00efve to phenylbutyric acid and for patients switching from \nsodium phenylbutyrate or from sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate injection to RAVICTI are \ndifferent. \n \nThe recommended total daily dose of RAVICTI is based on body surface area and ranges from \n4.5 ml/m2/day to 11.2 ml/m2/day (5.3 g/m2/day to 12.4 g/m2/day) and should take into account the \nfollowing:  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nThe total daily dose should be divided into equal amounts and given with each meal or feeding (e.g. \nthree times to six times per day). Each dose should be rounded up to the nearest 0.1 ml for patients less \nthan 2 years of age and 0.5 ml for patients 2 years of age and older. \n \nRecommended starting dose in phenylbutyrate-na\u00efve patients \n\u2022 8.5 ml/m2/day (9.4 g/m2/day) in patients with a body surface area (BSA) < 1.3 m2 \n\u2022 7 ml/m2/day (8 g/m2/day) in patients with a BSA \u2265 1.3 m2 \n \nInitial dose in patients switching from sodium phenylbutyrate to RAVICTI  \nPatients switching from sodium phenylbutyrate to RAVICTI should receive the dose of RAVICTI that \ncontains the same amount of phenylbutyric acid. The conversion is as follows:  \n\u2022 Total daily dose of RAVICTI (ml) = total daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate tablets (g) x 0.86 \n\u2022 Total daily dose of RAVICTI (ml) = total daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate powder (g) \n\nx 0.81 \n \nInitial dose in patients switching from sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate injection to RAVICTI  \nOnce stable with controlled ammonia, patients switching from sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate \nto RAVICTI should receive a dose of RAVICTI at the higher end of the treatment range \n(11.2 ml/m2/day) with measurements of plasma ammonia to guide further dosing. \n \nThe recommended daily dose schedule of 8.5 ml/m2/day - 11.2 ml/m2/day over a period of up to \n24 hours for patients stabilised with no further hyperammonaemia is as follows: \n \n\u2022 Step 1: 100% dose sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate and 50% dose of RAVICTI for \n\n4-8 hours;  \n\u2022 Step 2: 50% dose sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate and 100% RAVICTI for 4-8 hours;  \n\u2022 Step 3: sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate discontinued and full dose RAVICTI continued \n\naccording to feeding schedule for 4-8 hours. \n \nFor data regarding pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in this age group, see sections \n5.1 and 5.2. \n \nDose adjustment and monitoring in adults and children \nThe daily dose should be individually adjusted according to the patient\u2019s estimated urea synthetic \ncapacity, if any, protein tolerance and the daily dietary protein intake needed to promote growth and \ndevelopment. Dietary protein is approximately 16% nitrogen by weight. Given that approximately \n47% of dietary nitrogen is excreted as waste and approximately 70% of an administered \n4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) dose will be converted to urinary phenylacetylglutamine (U-PAGN), an \ninitial estimated glycerol phenylbutyrate dose for a 24-hour period is 0.6 ml glycerol phenylbutyrate \nper gram of dietary protein ingested per 24 hour period assuming all the waste nitrogen is covered by \nglycerol phenylbutyrate and excreted as phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN). \n \nAdjustment based on plasma ammonia  \nThe dose of glycerol phenylbutyrate should be adjusted to produce a fasting plasma ammonia level \nthat is less than half the upper limit of normal (ULN) in patients 6 years and older. In infants and \nyoung children (generally below 6 years of age) where obtaining fasting ammonia is problematic due \nto frequent feedings, the first ammonia of the morning should be kept below the ULN. \n \nAdjustment based on urinary phenylacetylglutamine \nU-PAGN measurements may be used to help guide glycerol phenylbutyrate dose adjustment and \nassess compliance. Each gram of U-PAGN excreted over 24 hours covers waste nitrogen generated \nfrom 1.4 grams of dietary protein. If U-PAGN excretion is insufficient to cover daily dietary protein \nintake and the fasting ammonia is greater than half the recommended ULN, the glycerol \nphenylbutyrate dose should be adjusted upward. The amount of dose adjustment should factor in the \namount of dietary protein that has not been covered, as indicated by the 24-h U-PAGN level and the \nestimated glycerol phenylbutyrate dose needed per gram of dietary protein ingested. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nSpot U-PAGN concentrations below the following levels may indicate improper medicinal product \nadministration and/or lack of compliance:  \n\u2022 9,000 microgram (mcg)/ml for patients under 2 years of age  \n\u2022 7,000 microgram (mcg)/ml for patients >2 years of age with a BSA of \u22641.3  \n\u2022 5,000 microgram (mcg)/ml for patients >2 years of age with a BSA of >1.3 \n \nIf spot U-PAGN concentrations fall below these levels, assess compliance with medicinal product \nand/or effectiveness of medicinal product administration (e.g., via feeding tube) and consider \nincreasing the glycerol phenylbutyrate dose in compliant patients to achieve optimal ammonia control \n(within normal limit for patients under 2 years of age and less than half ULN in older patients when \nfasted). \n \nAdjustment based on plasma phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine \nSymptoms of vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence, confusion, or sleepiness in the absence of high \nammonia or intercurrent illness may be signs of phenylacetic acid (PAA) toxicity (see section 4.4, \nPAA toxicity). Therefore, measurement of plasma PAA and PAGN levels may be useful to guide \ndosing. The plasma PAA to PAGN (both measured in mcg/ml) ratio has been observed to be generally \nless than 1 in patients without PAA accumulation. In patients with a PAA to PAGN ratio exceeding \n2.5, a further increase in glycerol phenylbutyrate dose may not increase PAGN formation, even if \nplasma PAA concentrations are increased, due to saturation of the conjugation reaction. In such cases, \nincreasing the dosing frequency may result in a lower plasma PAA level and PAA to PAGN ratio. \nAmmonia levels must be monitored closely when changing the dose of glycerol phenylbutyrate. \n \nN-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) and CITRIN (citrullinaemia type 2) deficiency \nThe safety and efficacy of RAVICTI for the treatment of patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase \n(NAGS) and CITRIN (citrullinaemia type 2) deficiency have not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nPosology is the same for adult and paediatric patients. \n \nMissed dose \n \nAny missed dose should be taken as soon as recognised. However, if the next scheduled dose is within \n2 hours for adults and within 30 minutes for children, the missed dose should be omitted and the usual \ndosing schedule resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (65 years or older) \nClinical studies of RAVICTI did not include sufficient numbers of subjects \u2265 65 years of age to \ndetermine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an \nelderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the \ngreater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other \nmedicinal product therapy. \n \nHepatic impairment \nBecause conversion of PAA to PAGN occurs in the liver, patients with severe hepatic impairment may \nhave reduced conversion capability and higher plasma PAA and plasma PAA to PAGN ratio. \nTherefore, dose for adult and paediatric patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment \nshould be started at the lower end of the recommended dosing range (4.5 ml/m2/day) and kept at the \nlowest dose necessary to control the patient\u2019s ammonia levels. A plasma PAA to PAGN ratio \nexceeding 2.5 may indicate saturation of PAA to PAGN conversion capacity and the need for reduced \ndosing and/or increased frequency of dosing. The plasma PAA to PAGN ratio may be useful in dose \nmonitoring (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nNo studies were conducted in UCD patients with renal impairment; the safety of glycerol \nphenylbutyrate in patients with renal impairment is unknown. RAVICTI should be used with caution \nin patients with severe renal impairment. Preferably such patients should be started and maintained at \nthe lowest dose necessary to control the blood ammonia levels. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral or gastroenteral use. \n \nRAVICTI should be taken with meals and administered directly into the mouth via an oral syringe. \nThe medicinal product should not be added or stirred into a large volume of other liquid, as glycerol \nphenylbutyrate is heavier than water and this may result in incomplete administration. Compatibility \nstudies have been conducted (see section 4.5). RAVICTI may be added to a small amount of apple \nsauce, ketchup, or squash puree and should be used within 2 hours when stored at room temperature \n(25 \u00b0C). The medicinal product may be mixed with medical formulas (Cyclinex-1, Cyclinex-2, \nUCD-1, UCD-2, Polycose, Pro Phree and Citrulline) and used within 2 hours when stored at 25 \u00b0C, or \nup to 24 hours, refrigerated.  \n \nThe RAVICTI pack contains the medicinal product and a reclosable bottle cap adapter.  \nPatients should be advised that CE marked oral syringes compatible with the reclosable bottle cap \nadapter, with suitable size for the prescribed dosing volume can be obtained from a pharmacy (see \nsection 6.6).  \n \nThe RAVICTI bottle should be opened by pushing down on the cap and twisting to the left. The \nreclosable bottle cap should then be twisted onto the bottle. The tip of the oral syringe should be \nplaced into the reclosable bottle cap adapter and the bottle should be turned upside down with the \nsyringe still inserted. The oral syringe should then be filled by pulling the plunger back until the \nsyringe is filled with the prescribed amount of medicinal product. The oral syringe should be tapped to \nremove air bubbles, while making sure it is filled with the correct amount of liquid. The liquid can be \nswallowed from the oral syringe or the oral syringe can be attached to a gastrostomy or nasogastric \ntube. The same oral syringe should be used for all doses taken each day. It is important to ensure that \nthe oral syringe is kept clean and dry between the dosing intervals. Neither the reclosable bottle cap \nnor the oral syringe should be rinsed between daily doses, as the presence of water causes glycerol \nphenylbutyrate to degrade. The tethered tab on the reclosable bottle adapter should be closed tightly \nafter use. The oral syringe should be discarded after the last dose of the day. The reclosable bottle cap \nshould be discarded when the bottle is empty or after 14 days following opening even if the bottle is \nnot empty. A new reclosable bottle cap should be used for each new bottle that is opened. \n \nRAVICTI may also be administered by CE marked medical grade silicone nasogastric or gastrostomy \ntube for those patients unable to take the medicinal product by mouth. \n \nFor additional information regarding method of administration and compatibility/in-use stability \nstudies please refer to section 6.6. \n \nPreparation for nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube administration \nIn vitro studies evaluating the percent recovery of total dose delivered with nasogastric, nasojejunal or \ngastrostomy tubes demonstrated the percent of dose recovered was > 99% for doses > 1 ml and 70% \nfor a 0.5 ml dose. For patients who can swallow liquids take RAVICTI should be taken orally, even \nthose with a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube. However, for patients who cannot swallow liquids, a \nnasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube may be used to administer RAVICTI as follows: \n\u2022 An oral syringe should be utilised to withdraw the prescribed dose of RAVICTI from the bottle  \n\u2022 The tip of the oral syringe should be placed onto the tip of the gastrostomy/nasogastric tube \n\u2022 The plunger of the oral syringe should be used to administer RAVICTI into the tube  \n\u2022 10 ml of water or medical formula should be used to flush the tube once, and the flush should be \n\nallowed to drain after administration \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIt is not recommended to administer a dose of 0.5 ml or less with nasogastric, gastrostomy or \nnasojejunal tubes, given the low drug recovery in dosing.  \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance.  \n\u2022 Treatment of acute hyperammonaemia.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEven while on treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate, acute hyperammonaemia including \nhyperammonaemic encephalopathy may occur in a proportion of patients. \n \nReduced phenylbutyrate absorption in pancreatic insufficiency or intestinal malabsorption \n \nExocrine pancreatic enzymes hydrolyse glycerol phenylbutyrate in the small intestine, separating the \nactive moiety, phenylbutyrate, from glycerol. This process allows phenylbutyrate to be absorbed into \nthe circulation. Low or absent pancreatic enzymes or intestinal disease resulting in fat malabsorption \nmay result in reduced or absent digestion of glycerol phenylbutyrate and/or absorption of \nphenylbutyrate and reduced control of plasma ammonia. Ammonia levels should be closely monitored \nin patients with pancreatic insufficiency or intestinal malabsorption. \n \nNeurotoxicity \n \nReversible clinical manifestations suggestive of neurotoxicity (e.g., nausea, vomiting, somnolence) \nhave been reportedly associated with phenylacetate levels ranging from 499-1,285 mcg/ml in cancer \npatients who received PAA intravenously. Although these have not been seen in clinical trials \ninvolving UCD patients, high PAA levels should be suspected in patients (particularly in children \n<2months) with unexplained somnolence, confusion, nausea and lethargy who have normal or low \nammonia. \n \nIf symptoms of vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence, confusion, or sleepiness are present in the \nabsence of high ammonia or other intercurrent illnesses, measure plasma PAA and plasma PAA to \nPAGN, it should be considered to reduce the glycerol phenylbutyrate dose or increase the frequency of \ndosing if the PAA level exceeds 500 mcg/L and the plasma PAA to PAGN ratio exceeds 2.5. \n \nMonitoring and laboratory tests \n \nThe daily dose should be individually adjusted according to the patient\u2019s estimated urea synthetic \ncapacity, if any, amino acid profile, protein tolerance and the daily dietary protein intake needed to \npromote growth and development. Supplemental amino acid formulations may be necessary to \nmaintain essential amino acids and branched chain amino acids within normal range. Further \nadjustment may be based on monitoring of plasma ammonia, glutamine, U-PAGN and/or plasma PAA \nand PAGN as well as the ratio of plasma PAA to PAGN (see section 4.2). \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ammonia \n \nCorticosteroids \nUse of corticosteroids may cause the breakdown of body protein and increase plasma ammonia levels. \nMonitor ammonia levels closely when corticosteroids and glycerol phenylbutyrate are used \nconcomitantly. \n \nValproic acid and haloperidol \nHyperammonemia may be induced by haloperidol and by valproic acid. Monitor ammonia levels \nclosely when use of valproic acid or haloperidol is necessary in UCD patients. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nProbenecid \nProbenecid may inhibit the renal excretion of metabolites of glycerol phenylbutyrate including PAGN. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females  \n \nEffective contraceptive measures must be taken by women of child-bearing potential (see section 4.6). \n \nPregnancy \n \nRAVICTI should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with glycerol \nphenylbutyrate, see section 4.6.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of medicinal products known to inhibit lipase should be given with caution as \nglycerol phenylbutyrate is hydrolysed by digestive lipase into phenylbutyrate acid and glycerol. This \nmay be associated with increased risk of medicinal product interactions with lipase inhibitors and with \nlipase contained in pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies.  \n \nA potential effect on CYP2D6 isoenzyme cannot be excluded and caution is advised for patients who \nreceive medicinal products that are CYP2D6 substrates.  \n \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate and/or its metabolites, PAA and PBA, have been shown to be weak inducers \nof CYP3A4 enzyme in vivo. In vivo exposure to glycerol phenylbutyrate has resulted in decreased \nsystemic exposure to midazolam of approximately 32% and increased exposure to the 1-hydroxy \nmetabolite of midazolam, suggesting that steady-state dosing of glycerol phenylbutyrate results in \nCYP3A4 induction. The potential for interaction of glycerol phenylbutyrate as a CYP3A4 inducer and \nthose products predominantly metabolised by the CYP3A4 pathway is possible. Therefore, therapeutic \neffects and/or metabolite levels of medicinal products, including some oral contraceptives that are \nsubstrates for this enzyme may be reduced and their full effects cannot be guaranteed, following co-\nadministration with glycerol phenylbutyrate. \n \nOther medicinal products such as corticosteroids, valproic acid, haloperidol and probenecid may have \nthe potential to affect ammonia levels, see section 4.4. \n \nThe effects of glycerol phenylbutyrate on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 isoenzyme and potential for \ninteraction with celecoxib has been studied in humans with no evidence of an interaction observed. \n \nEffects of glycerol phenylbutyrate on other CYP isoenzymes have not been studied in humans and \ncannot be excluded. \n \nCompatibility studies have demonstrated glycerol phenylbutyrate chemical and physical in-use \nstability with the following foods and nutritional supplements: apple sauce, ketchup, squash puree, and \nfive medical formulas (Cyclinex-1, Cyclinex-2, UCD-1, UCD-2, Polycose, Pro Phree and Citrulline) \ntypically consumed by UCD patients (see section 4.2).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females  \n \nThe use of RAVICTI in women of childbearing potential must be accompanied by the use of effective \ncontraception (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nPregnancy \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). There are limited data regarding \nthe use of glycerol phenylbutyrate in pregnant women. \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential \nnot using contraception unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with glycerol \nphenylbutyrate (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether glycerol phenylbutyrate or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to \nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from glycerol phenylbutyrate therapy taking into account the benefit \nof breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate had no effect on fertility or reproductive function in male and female rats (see \nsection 5.3). There are no data for human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRAVICTI may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines given that treatment with \nglycerol phenylbutyrate may cause dizziness or headaches (see section 4.8). Patients should not drive \nor use machines whilst experiencing these adverse reactions. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions was based on exposure in 114 UCD patients (65 adults and 49 \nchildren between the ages of 2 months and 17 years) with deficiencies in CPS, OTC, ASS, ASL, ARG, \nor HHH across 4 short term and 3 long term clinical studies, in which 90 patients completed \n12 months duration (median exposure = 51 weeks). \n \nAt the beginning of the treatment, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, and/or headache may occur; \nthese reactions usually disappear within a few days even if treatment is continued. The most frequently \nreported adverse reactions (>5%) during glycerol phenylbutyrate treatment were diarrhoea, flatulence, \nand headache (8.8% each); decreased appetite (7.0%), vomiting (6.1%); and fatigue, nausea and, skin \nodour abnormal (5.3% each). \n \nAdditional adverse reactions have been evaluated in a clinical study including 16 UCD patients less \nthan 2 months of age. The median exposure was 10 months (range 2 to 20 months). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequency is defined \nas very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.  \n \nAny adverse reaction reported in one patient met the uncommon criteria. Due to the rarity of the UCD \npopulation, and the small size of the medicinal product safety population database (N=114), the \nadverse reaction frequency for rare and very rare is not known. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 1.

Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nPAA, the active metabolite of glycerol phenylbutyrate, is associated with signs and symptoms of \nneurotoxicity (see section 4.4) and could accumulate in patients who receive an overdose. In case of \noverdose, the medicinal product should be discontinued and the patient monitored for any signs or \nsymptoms of adverse reactions. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary tract \nand metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX09 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate is a nitrogen-binding medicinal product. It is a triglyceride containing \n3 molecules of PBA linked to a glycerol backbone. \n \nUCDs are inherited deficiencies of enzymes or transporters necessary for the synthesis of urea from \nammonia (NH3, NH4+). Absence of these enzymes or transporters results in the accumulation of toxic \nlevels of ammonia in the blood and brain of affected patients. Glycerol phenylbutyrate is hydrolysed \nby pancreatic lipases to yield, PBA, which is converted by beta oxidation to PAA, the active moiety of \nglycerol phenylbutyrate. PAA conjugates with glutamine (which contains 2 molecules of nitrogen) via \nacetylation in the liver and kidneys to form PAGN, which is excreted by the kidneys. On a molar \nbasis, PAGN, like urea, contains 2 moles of nitrogen and provides an alternate vehicle for waste \nnitrogen excretion. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nPharmacological effects \nIn the pooled analysis of studies where patients switched from sodium phenylbutyrate to glycerol \nphenylbutyrate, ammonia AUC0-24h was 774.11 and 991.19 [(micromol/L)*hour] during treatment with \nglycerol phenylbutyrate and sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively (n = 80, ratio of geometric means \n0.84; 95% confidence intervals 0.740, 0.949). \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nThe effect of multiple doses of glycerol phenylbutyrate 13.2 g/day and 19.8 g/day (approximately 69% \nand 104% of the maximum recommended daily dose) on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomised, \nplacebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg), four-treatment-arm, crossover study in 57 \nhealthy subjects. The upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-\ncorrected QTc, based on individual correction method (QTcI) for glycerol phenylbutyrate, was below \n10 ms, demonstrating that glycerol phenylbutyrate had no QT/QTc prolonging effect. Assay sensitivity \nwas confirmed by significant QTc prolongation of the positive control, moxifloxacin. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical studies in adult patients with UCDs \nActive-controlled, 4-week, noninferiority, blinded crossover study (Study 1) \nA randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, crossover, noninferiority study (Study 1) compared \nequivalent doses of glycerol phenylbutyrate to sodium phenylbutyrate by evaluating 24-hour venous \nammonia levels in patients with UCDs who had been on sodium phenylbutyrate prior to enrolment for \ncontrol of their UCD. Patients were required to have a diagnosis of UCD involving deficiencies of \nCPS, OTC, or ASS, confirmed via enzymatic, biochemical, or genetic testing. Patients had to have no \nclinical evidence of hyperammonaemia at enrolment and were not allowed to receive medicinal \nproducts known to increase ammonia levels (e.g., valproate), increase protein catabolism (e.g., \ncorticosteroids), or significantly affect renal clearance (e.g., probenecid). \n \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate was non-inferior to sodium phenylbutyrate with respect to the 24-hour AUC \nfor ammonia. Forty-four patients were evaluated in this analysis. Mean 24-hour AUCs for venous \nammonia during steady-state dosing were 866 micromol/L*hour and 977 micromol/L*hour with \n\n\n\n12 \n\nglycerol phenylbutyrate and sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively (n = 44, ratio of geometric means \n0.91; 95% confidence intervals 0.799, 1.034).  \n \nConsistent with plasma ammonia, blood glutamine levels were lower during glycerol phenylbutyrate \ntreatment as compared with sodium phenylbutyrate in each arm of the crossover study (decrease of \n44.3 \u00b1 154.43 micromol/L after glycerol phenylbutyrate compared with NaPBA; p = 0.064, paired \nt-test; p = 0.048, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). \n \nOpen-label uncontrolled extension study in adults \nA long-term (12-month), uncontrolled, open-label study (Study 2) was conducted to assess monthly \nammonia control and hyperammonaemic crisis over a 12-month period. A total of 51 adult patients \ninvolving deficiencies of CPS, OTC, ASS, ASL, ARG, and HHH were enrolled in the study and all \nbut 6 had been converted from sodium phenylbutyrate to equivalent doses of glycerol phenylbutyrate. \nVenous ammonia levels were monitored monthly. Mean fasting venous ammonia values in adults in \nStudy 2 were within normal limits during long-term treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate (range: \n6-30 micromol/L). Of 51 adult patients participating in Study 2, 7 patients (14%) reported a total of 10 \nhyperammonaemic crises during treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate as compared with 9 patients \n(18 %) who had reported a total of 15 crises in the 12 months prior to study entry while they were \nbeing treated with sodium phenylbutyrate.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nClinical studies in paediatric patients with UCDs \nThe efficacy of glycerol phenylbutyrate in paediatric patients 2 months to 17 years of age involving \ndeficiencies of OTC, ASS, ASL, and ARG was evaluated in 2 fixed sequence, open-label, sodium \nphenylbutyrate to equivalent dosing of glycerol phenylbutyrate switchover studies (Studies 3 and 4). \nStudy 3 was 14 days in duration and Study 4 was 10 days in duration.  \n \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate was found to be non-inferior to sodium phenylbutyrate with respect to \nammonia control in both of these paediatric studies. In the pooled analysis of the short-term studies in \nchildren (Study 3 and Study 4), plasma ammonia was significantly lower after switching to glycerol \nphenylbutyrate; ammonia AUC0-24h was 626.79 and 871.72 (micromol/L)*hour during treatment with \nglycerol phenylbutyrate and sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively (n = 26, ratio of geometric means \n0.79; 95% confidence intervals 0.647, 0.955). \n \nMean blood glutamine levels were also non-significantly lower after glycerol phenylbutyrate treatment \ncompared with sodium phenylbutyrate treatment by -45.2 \u00b1 142.94 micromol/L (p = 0.135, paired \nt-test; p = 0.114, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).  \n \nOpen-label, uncontrolled, extension studies in paediatric patients \nLong-term (12-month), uncontrolled, open-label studies were conducted to assess monthly ammonia \ncontrol and hyperammonaemic crisis over a 12-month period in three studies (Study 2, which also \nenrolled adults, and extensions of Studies 3 and 4). A total of 49 children ages 2 months to 17 years \nwith deficiencies of OTC, ASS, ASL, and ARG were enrolled, and all but 1 had been converted from \nsodium phenylbutyrate to glycerol phenylbutyrate. Mean fasting venous ammonia values were within \nnormal limits during long-term treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate (range: 17-25 micromol/L). Of \nthe 49 paediatric patients who participated in these extension studies, 12 patients (25 %) reported a \ntotal of 17 hyperammonaemic crises during treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate as compared with \n38 crises in 21 patients (43 %) in the preceding 12 months prior to study entry, while they were being \ntreated with sodium phenylbutyrate. \n \nAn open-label, long-term study (Study 5) was conducted to assess ammonia control in paediatric \npatients with UCD. The study enrolled a total of 45 paediatric patients between the ages of 1 and \n17 years with UCD who had completed Study 2 and the safety extensions of Studies 3 and 4. The \nlength of study participation ranged from 0.2 to 5.9 years. Venous ammonia levels were monitored at a \nminimum of every 6 months. Mean venous ammonia values in paediatric patients in Study 5 were \nwithin normal limits during long-term (24 months) treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate (range: \n\n\n\n13 \n\n15-25 micromol/L). Of the 45 paediatric patients participating in the open-label treatment with \nglycerol phenylbutyrate, 11 patients (24%) reported a total of 22 hyperammonemic crises. \n \nIn an additional long term (24 month), uncontrolled, open-label clinical study the safety of RAVICTI \nhas been evaluated in 16 UCD patients less than 2 months of age and 10 paediatric patients with UCDs \naged 2 months to less than 2 years. \n \nStudy in children less than 2 months of age \nA total of 16 paediatric patients with UCDs aged less than 2 months participated in a long-term \n(24 months), uncontrolled, open-label study, of which 10 patients converted from sodium \nphenylbutyrate to RAVICTI. Three patients were treatment na\u00efve and three additional patients were \ngradually discontinued from intravenous sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate while RAVICTI \nwas initiated. All patients successfully transitioned to RAVICTI within 3 days, where successful \ntransition was defined as no signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia and a venous ammonia value \nless than 100 micromol/L. The mean normalized venous ammonia values in paediatric patients aged \nless than 2 months were within normal limits during long-term treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate \n(range: 35 to 94 micromol/L).  \n \nHyperammonaemia was reported in 5 (50%) subjects age < 1 month (all serious but non-fatal) and 1 \nsubject (16.7%) age 1-2 months (non-serious), which is consistent with more severe disease types \ndiagnosed in the neonatal period. In 4 of the 5 subjects age < 1 month, possible risk factors included \ninfectious precipitants, hyperammonaemic crisis at baseline, and missing dose. No precipitant trigger \nor missing dose was reported for the other 2 subjects (1 age < 1 month, 1 age 1-2 months). Dose \nadjustment was made to 3 subjects age < 1 month. \n \nStudy in children 2 months to less than 2 years of age \nA total of 10 paediatric patients with UCDs aged 2 months to less than 2 years participated in a long \nterm (24 months) uncontrolled, open label study, of which 6 patients converted from sodium \nphenylbutyrate to RAVICTI and 1 patient converted from sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium \nbenzoate. Two patients were treatment na\u00efve and one additional patient was gradually discontinued \nfrom intravenous sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate while RAVICTI was initiated.  \n \nNine patients successfully transitioned to RAVICTI within 4 days, followed by 3 days of observation \nfor a total of 7 days, where successful transition was defined as no signs and symptoms of \nhyperammonemia and a venous ammonia value less than 100 micromol/L. One additional patient \ndeveloped hyperammonemia on day 3 of dosing and experienced surgical complications (bowel \nperforation and peritonitis) following jejunal tube placement on day 4. This patient developed \nhyperammonemic crisis on day 6, and subsequently died of sepsis from peritonitis unrelated to \nmedicinal product. Although two patients had day 7 ammonia values of 150 micromol/L and \n111 micromol/L respectively, neither had associated signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. \n \nThree patients reported a total of 7 hyperammonemic crises defined as having signs and symptoms \nconsistent with hyperammonemia (such as frequent vomiting, nausea, headache, lethargy, irritability, \ncombativeness, and/or somnolence) associated with high venous ammonia levels and requiring \nmedical intervention. Hyperammonemic crises were precipitated by vomiting, upper respiratory tract \ninfection, gastroenteritis, decreased caloric intake or had no identified precipitating event (3 events). \nThere was one additional patient who had one venous ammonia level that exceeded 100 micromol/L \nwhich was not associated with a hyperammonemic crisis.   \n \nADRs are summarised in section 4.8.  \n \nReversal of the pre-existing neurological impairment is unlikely following treatment and neurological \ndeterioration may continue in some patients. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRAVICTI is a pro-drug of PBA. Upon oral ingestion, PBA is released from the glycerol backbone in \nthe gastrointestinal tract by pancreatic lipases. PBA derived from glycerol phenylbutyrate is further \nconverted by \u03b2-oxidation to PAA. \n \nIn healthy, fasting adult subjects receiving a single oral dose of 2.9 ml/m2 of glycerol phenylbutyrate, \npeak plasma levels of PBA, PAA, and PAGN occurred at 2 h, 4 h, and 4 h, respectively. Upon single-\ndose administration of glycerol phenylbutyrate, plasma concentrations of PBA were quantifiable in 15 \nof 22 participants at the first sample time post dose (0.25 h). Mean maximum concentration (Cmax) for \nPBA, PAA, and PAGN was 37.0 micrograms/ml, 14.9 micrograms/ml, and 30.2 micrograms/ml, \nrespectively. In healthy subjects, intact glycerol phenylbutyrate was not detected in plasma.  \n \nIn healthy subjects, the systemic exposure to PAA, PBA, and PAGN increased in a dose dependent \nmanner. Following 4 ml of glycerol phenylbutyrate for 3 days (3 times a day [TID]), mean Cmax and \nAUC were 66 mcg/ml and 930 mcg\u2022h/ml for PBA and 28 microgram /ml and 942 mcg\u2022h/ml for PAA, \nrespectively. In the same study, following 6 ml of glycerol phenylbutyrate for 3 days (TID), mean Cmax \nand AUC were 100 mcg/ml and 1,400 mcg\u2022h/ml for PBA and 65 mcg/ml and 2,064 mcg\u2022h/ml for \nPAA, respectively. \n \nIn adult UCD patients receiving multiple doses of glycerol phenylbutyrate, maximum plasma \nconcentrations at steady state (Cmax, ss) of PBA, PAA, and PAGN occurred at 8 h, 12 h, and 10 h, \nrespectively, after the first dose in the day. Intact glycerol phenylbutyrate was not detectable in plasma \nin UCD patients. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling and dosing simulations suggest that PBA enters the circulation \nabout 70-75% more slowly when given orally as glycerol phenylbutyrate as compared with sodium \nphenylbutyrate and further indicate that body surface area is the most significant covariate explaining \nthe variability of PAA clearance. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn vitro, the extent of human plasma protein binding for 14C-labeled metabolites was 80.6% to 98.0% \nfor PBA (over 1-250 microgram/ml), and 37.1% to 65.6% for PAA (over 5-500 microgram/ml). The \nprotein binding for PAGN was 7% to 12% and no concentration effects were noted. \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nUpon oral administration, pancreatic lipases hydrolyse glycerol phenylbutyrate and release PBA. PBA \nundergoes \u03b2-oxidation to PAA, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and in the kidney \nthrough the enzyme phenylacetyl-CoA: Lglutamine- N-acetyltransferase to form PAGN. PAGN is \nsubsequently eliminated in the urine. \n \nSaturation of conjugation of PAA and glutamine to form PAGN was suggested by increases in the \nratio of plasma PAA to PAGN with increasing dose and with increasing severity of hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nIn healthy subjects, after administration of 4 ml, 6 ml, and 9 ml 3 times daily for 3 days, the ratio of \nmean AUC0-23h of PAA to PAGN was 1, 1.25, and 1.6, respectively. In a separate study, in patients \nwith hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C), the ratios of mean values for PAA to PAGN among all \npatients dosed with 6 ml and 9 ml twice daily ranged from 0.96 to 1.28 and for patients dosed with \n9 ml twice daily ranged from 1.18-3.19. \n \nIn in vitro studies, the specific activity of lipases for glycerol phenylbutyrate was seen in the following \ndecreasing order: pancreatic triglyceride lipase, carboxyl ester lipase, and pancreatic lipase\u2013related \n\n\n\n15 \n\nprotein 2. Further, glycerol phenylbutyrate was hydrolysed in vitro by esterases in human plasma. In \nthese in vitro studies, a complete disappearance of glycerol phenylbutyrate did not produce molar \nequivalent PBA, suggesting the formation of mono- or bis-ester metabolites. However, the formation \nof mono- or bis-esters was not studied in humans. \n \nElimination \n \nThe mean (SD) percentage of administered PBA eliminated as PAGN was approximately 68.9% \n(17.2) in adults and 66.4% (23.9) in paediatric UCD patients at steady state. PAA and PBA \nrepresented minor urinary metabolites, each accounting for <1% of the administered dose of PBA. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a study in patients with clinically decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (Child-Pugh \nB and C), mean Cmax of PAA was 144 mcg/ml (range: 14-358 mcg/ml) after daily dosing of 6 ml of \nglycerol phenylbutyrate twice daily, while mean Cmax of PAA was 292 mcg/ml (range: \n57-655 mcg/ml) after daily dosing of 9 ml of glycerol phenylbutyrate twice daily. The ratio of mean \nvalues for PAA to PAGN among all patients dosed with 6 ml BID ranged from 0.96 to 1.28 and for \npatients dosed with 9 ml twice daily ranged from 1.18-3.19. After multiple doses, a PAA \nconcentration >200 mcg/L was associated with a ratio of plasma PAA to PAGN concentrations higher \nthan 2.5. \n \nThese findings collectively indicate that conversion of PAA to PAGN may be impaired in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment and that a plasma PAA to PAGN ratio > 2.5 identifies patients at risk \nof elevated PAA levels. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of glycerol phenylbutyrate in patients with impaired renal function, including \nthose with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or those on haemodialysis, have not been studied. \n \nGender \nIn healthy adult volunteers, a gender effect was found for all metabolites, with women generally \nhaving higher plasma concentrations of all metabolites than men at a given dose level. In healthy \nfemale volunteers, mean Cmax for PAA was 51% and 120% higher than in male volunteers after \nadministration of 4 ml and 6 ml 3 times daily for 3 days, respectively. The dose normalized mean \nAUC0-23h for PAA was 108% higher in females than in males. However, dosing in UCD patients must \nbe individualized based on the specific metabolic needs and residual enzyme capacity of the patient, \nirrespective of gender. \n \nPaediatric population \nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling and dosing simulations suggest body surface area is the most \nsignificant covariate explaining the variability of PAA clearance. PAA clearance was 7.1 L/h, 10.9 L/h, \n16.4 L/h, and 24.4 L/h, respectively, for UCD patients ages \u2264 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 17 years. In \n16 paediatric UCD patients aged less than 2 months, PAA clearance was 3.8 L/h. In 7 paediatric patients \naged 2 months to under 2 years of age who received RAVICTI for up to 12 months, the concentrations \nof PAA, PBA, and PAGN did not increase over the treatment period and the overall median PAA, PBA, \nand PAGN concentrations in these patients were similar to those observed in older paediatric age groups. \n \nThe mean peak ratio of PAA to PAGN in UCD patients aged birth to less than 2 months was higher \n(mean: 1.65; range 0.14 to 7.07) than for UCD patients aged 2 months to less than 2 years (mean 0.59; \nrange 0.17 to 1.21). No PAA toxicity was observed in the subjects age < 2 months. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nCarcinogenesis \n \nIn a rat study, glycerol phenylbutyrate caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of \npancreatic acinar cell adenoma, carcinoma, and combined adenoma or carcinoma in males and \nfemales, at a dose of 4.7 and 8.4 times the dose in adult patients, (6.87 ml/m2/day based on combined \nAUCs for PBA and PAA). The incidence of the following tumours was also increased in female rats: \nthyroid follicular cell adenoma, carcinoma and combined adenoma or carcinoma, adrenal cortical \ncombined adenoma or carcinoma, cervical schwannoma, uterine endometrial stromal polyp, and \ncombined polyp or sarcoma. \n \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate was not tumourigenic at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day in a 26 week mouse \nstudy. \n \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate has been tested in a range of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and \nshown no genotoxic activity. \n \nImpairment of fertility \n \nGlycerol phenylbutyrate had no effect on fertility or reproductive function in male and female rats at \nclinical exposure levels, however at oral doses up to approximately 7 times the dose in adult patients, \nmaternal as well as male toxicity was observed and the number of nonviable embryos was increased. \n \nDevelopment studies \n \nOral administration of glycerol phenylbutyrate during the period of organogenesis in rats and rabbits \nhad no effects on embryo-foetal development at 2.7 and 1.9 times the dose in adult patients, \nrespectively. However, maternal toxicity and adverse effects on embryo-foetal development including \nreduced foetal weights and cervical ribs were observed in a rat study with a dose approximately 6 \ntimes the dose in adult patients, based on combined AUCs for PBA and PAA. No developmental \nabnormalities were observed in rats through day 92 postpartum following oral administration in \npregnant rats, during organogenesis and lactation. \n \nJuvenile animal study \n \nIn a juvenile rat study with daily oral dosing performed on postpartum day 2 through mating and \npregnancy after maturation, terminal body weight was dose-dependently reduced in males and \nfemales, by up to 16% and 12% respectively. Fertility (number of pregnant rats) was decreased by up \nto 25%, at a dose of 2.6 times the dose in adult patients. Embryo toxicity (increased resorptions) and \nreduced litter size was also observed. \n \n \n6.

The reclosable bottle cap adapter and the oral syringe \nshould not be rinsed between daily doses as the introduction of water causes glycerol phenylbutyrate \nto degrade. The oral syringe should be discarded after the last dose of each day. The same reclosable \nbottle cap adapter can be used until a bottle is empty. A new reclosable bottle cap adapter should be \nused for each new bottle that is opened. \n \nChemical compatibility of glycerol phenylbutyrate with medical grade silicone nasogastric, \ngastrostomy, and nasojejunal tubes has been demonstrated.  In vitro studies evaluating the percent \nrecovery of total dose delivered with nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes demonstrated the percent of \ndose recovered was >99% for doses > 1 ml and 70% for a 0.5 ml dose. Therefore, it is recommended \nthat nasogastric, nasojejunal or gastrostomy tubes only be used to administer doses > 1 ml. If there is a \nneed to administer a dose of 0.5 ml or less with such nasogastric, gastrostomy or nasojejunal tubes, \nconsideration should be given to the low drug recovery in dosing. \n \n \n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine, because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What RAVICTI is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take RAVICTI  \n3. How to take RAVICTI  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store RAVICTI  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What RAVICTI is and what it is used for \n \nRAVICTI contains the active substance \u2018glycerol phenylbutyrate\u2019 which is used to treat six known \n\u2018urea cycle disorders\u2019 (UCDs) in adults and children. The UCDs include deficiencies of certain liver \nenzymes such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC), \nargininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), arginase I (ARG) and ornithine \ntranslocase deficiency hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia homocitrullinuria syndrome (HHH). \n \nRAVICTI must be combined with a diet reduced in protein intake, and in some cases a diet with \nsupplements such as essential amino acids (arginine, citrulline, protein-free calorie supplements). \n \nAbout urea cycle disorders \n\u2022 In urea cycle disorders, the body cannot remove the nitrogen from the protein that we eat. \n\u2022 Normally, the body turns the extra nitrogen in the protein into a waste compound called \n\n\u2018ammonia\u2019. The liver then removes ammonia from the body through a cycle called the \u2018urea \ncycle\u2019. \n\n\u2022 In urea cycle disorders, the body is not able to produce enough liver enzymes to remove the \nextra nitrogen. \n\n\u2022 This means that ammonia builds up in the body. If ammonia is not removed from the body, it \ncan harm the brain and lead to low levels of consciousness or coma. \n\n\u2022 Urea cycle disorders are rare. \n \nHow RAVICTI works \nRAVICTI helps the body to eliminate waste nitrogen. This reduces the amount of ammonia in your \nbody.  \n \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take RAVICTI \n \nDo not take RAVICTI \n\u2022 if you are allergic to glycerol phenylbutyrate \n\u2022 if you have acute hyperammonaemia (high levels of ammonia in your blood), which requires \n\nmore rapid intervention (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d) \n \nIf you are not sure if the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nRAVICTI. \n \nWarnings and precautions   \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking RAVICTI: \n\u2022 if you have problems with your kidneys or liver - this is because glycerol phenylbutyrate is \n\nremoved from your body through the kidneys and liver \n\u2022 if you have problems with your pancreas, stomach or gut (\u2018intestines\u2019) - these organs are \n\nresponsible for absorption of glycerol phenylbutyrate into the body \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nRAVICTI. \n \nIn some cases such as infection or post-surgery, the amount of ammonia may go up despite treatment \nwith this medicine and may damage the brain (hyperammonaemic encephalopathy).  \n \nIn other cases the amount of ammonia in the blood goes up quickly. In this case, glycerol \nphenylbutyrate will not stop the level of ammonia in your blood from becoming seriously high.  \nHigh levels of ammonia leads to feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) or feeling confused.  \nTell your doctor or go to the hospital straight away if you notice any of these signs. \n \nLaboratory tests will be needed so your doctor can determine and maintain the correct dose for you.  \n \nOther medicines and RAVICTI \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines, which \nmay be less effective when used with glycerol phenylbutyrate. If you take these medicines, you may \nneed regular blood tests:  \n\u2022 midazolam and barbiturates - used for sedation, trouble sleeping or epilepsy \n\u2022 contraceptives \n \nAlso, tell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines as they may increase the amount of \nammonia in your body or change how glycerol phenylbutyrate works: \n\u2022 corticosteroids - used to treat inflamed areas of the body \n\u2022 valproate - a medicine for epilepsy  \n\u2022 haloperidol - used to treat some mental health problems  \n\u2022 probenecid - to treat high levels of uric acid in the blood which can cause gout \n\n(\u2018hyper-uricaemia\u2019)   \n\u2022 lipase inhibitors (such as orlistat) \u2013 used to treat obesity \n\u2022 lipase in pancreatic replacement therapies \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before taking RAVICTI. \n \nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding  \n\u2022 If you are pregnant, tell your doctor before you start taking RAVICTI. If you become pregnant \n\nwhile taking RAVICTI, talk to your doctor. RAVICTI should not be used during pregnancy, as a \nrisk for your unborn baby cannot be excluded.  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n\u2022 If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of \ncontraception, during treatment with RAVICTI. Talk to your doctor about the best method of \ncontraception for you.   \n\n\u2022 You should discuss with your physician before you plan to breast-feed while taking RAVICTI.  \nA decision should be made whether to breast-feed or stop taking RAVICTI taking into account \nthe benefit of the treatment for you and the benefit of breast-feeding for your baby. This is \nbecause RAVICTI may pass into breast milk and a risk to the newborn/infant cannot be \nexcluded.  \n\n \nDriving and using machines  \nRAVICTI may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When taking glycerol \nphenylbutyrate you may feel dizzy or have a headache. Do not drive or use machines whilst \nexperiencing these side effects. \n \n \n3.  How to take RAVICTI \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nYou must follow a special low protein diet during treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate. \n\u2022 This diet will be designed for you by your doctor and dietician.  \n\u2022 You must follow this diet carefully. \n\u2022 You may need to take supplemental amino acid formulations. \n\u2022 You will need to have treatment and to follow a diet throughout your life, unless you have a \n\nsuccessful liver transplantation. \n \nHow much to take  \nYour doctor will tell you how much RAVICTI you should take each day. \n\u2022 Your daily dose will depend on your size and weight, the amount of protein in your diet, and \n\nyour overall urea cycle disorder condition.  \n\u2022 Your doctor may give you a lower dose if you have kidney or liver problems. \n\u2022 You will need regular blood tests so your doctor can determine the correct dose for you. \n\u2022 Your doctor might tell you to take RAVICTI more than 3 times each day. In small children, this \n\nmay be 4 to 6 times a day. There must be at least 3 hours between each dose. \n \nTaking this medicine  \nYour doctor will tell you how to take RAVICTI oral liquid. It can be taken in the following ways: \n\u2022 by mouth  \n\u2022 through a tube that goes through your tummy (\u2018abdomen\u2019) to the stomach - called a \n\n\u2018gastrostomy tube\u2019  \n\u2022 through a tube that goes through your nose to the stomach - called a \u2018nasogastric tube\u2019   \n\n \nTake RAVICTI by mouth unless otherwise directed by your doctor.  \n \nRAVICTI and meals \nTake RAVICTI with or straight after a meal. Young children should be given the medicine during or \nstraight after a feeding.   \n \nMeasuring the dose  \n\u2022 Use an oral syringe to measure your dose.  \n\u2022 You should have the medicine with the reclosable bottle cap adapter along with an oral syringe \n\nto administer the correct amount of glycerol phenylbutyrate. \n \n\n1. Open the bottle of RAVICTI by pushing down on the cap and twisting to the left. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n2. Twist the reclosable bottle cap adapter onto the bottle. \n\n3. Place the tip of the oral syringe into the reclosable bottle cap adapter.  \n\n4. Turn the bottle upside down with the oral syringe still inserted. \n\n5. Fill the oral syringe by pulling the plunger back until the syringe is filled with the amount of \nglycerol phenylbutyrate liquid that your doctor has told you to take. \n\n\u2212 Note: If possible, use the oral syringe ml size that is nearest to (but not smaller than) \nthe recommended dose (for example, if the dose is 0.8 ml, use a 1 ml oral syringe). \n\n \n6. Tap the oral syringe to remove air bubbles, making sure you have filled it with the correct \n\namount of liquid.  \n\n  \n7. Swallow the liquid from the oral syringe or attach the oral syringe to a gastrostomy or \n\nnasogastric tube.  \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n8. Important note: Do not add or stir RAVICTI into larger volumes of liquid such as water or \njuice as RAVICTI is heavier than most liquids. Mixing RAVICTI with large volumes of liquid \nmay result in you not getting the full dose.  \n\n9. RAVICTI can be added to a small amount of soft foods, such as ketchup, medical formulas, \napple sauce or squash puree. \n\n10. If the volume of your oral syringe is smaller than your prescribed dose, you will have to repeat \nthese steps to get your full dose. Use one oral syringe for all doses taken each day. \n\n11. After you take your full dose, have a drink of water to make sure no medicine is left in your \nmouth, or flush the gastrostomy or nasogastric tube with 10 ml of water using a new oral \nsyringe. The syringe used to flush the gastrostomy or nasogastric tube shall not be used for \nmeasuring the dose of RAVICTI to avoid introduction of water into the medicine. \n\n \n12. Close the tab on the reclosable bottle cap adapter.   \n\n \n13. Important note: Do not rinse the reclosable bottle cap adapter or the oral syringe between \n\ndaily doses as the introduction of water causes glycerol phenylbutyrate to degrade. If \nRAVICTI gets in contact with water, the liquid will become cloudy in appearance. Store bottle \nand oral syringe in a clean, dry place between doses. \n\n14. Discard the oral syringe after the last dose of the day. Do not re-use the oral syringe for \nmeasuring the dose of RAVICTI on another day. The reclosable bottle cap adapter can be used \nuntil the bottle is empty. A new reclosable bottle cap adapter should be used when a new \nbottle is opened.  \n\n15. Remaining unused syringes should be kept for use with another bottle. Each bottle should be \ndiscarded after 14 days. \n\n \nIf you take more RAVICTI than you should  \nIf you take more of this medicine than you should, talk to a doctor.  \n \nIf you notice any of the following signs, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away as these may \nbe signs of overdose or high ammonia: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy, tired, light-headed or sometimes confused  \n\u2022 headache  \n\u2022 changes in taste  \n\u2022 problems hearing  \n\u2022 feeling disorientated  \n\u2022 less able to remember things  \n\u2022 existing neurological conditions may get worse \n \nIf you forget to take RAVICTI \nIf you forget a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. However, for adults, if the next \ndose is in less than 2 hours, then skip it and take your next dose as normal. \nFor children: if the next dose is in less than 30 minutes, then skip it and give the next dose as normal. \n\u2022 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nIf you stop taking RAVICTI  \nYou will need to take this medicine and follow a special low protein diet throughout your life. Do not \nstop taking glycerol phenylbutyrate without talking to your doctor.  \n \n \n4.

intervention (see section \"warnings and precautions\") if you are not sure if the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ravicti. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ravicti: if you have problems with your kidneys or liver - this is because glycerol phenylbutyrate is removed from your body through the kidneys and liver if you have problems with your pancreas, stomach or gut ('intestines') - these organs are responsible for absorption of glycerol phenylbutyrate into the body if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ravicti. in some cases such as infection or post-surgery, the amount of ammonia may go up despite treatment with this medicine and may damage the brain (hyperammonaemic encephalopathy). in other cases the amount of ammonia in the blood goes up quickly. in this case, glycerol phenylbutyrate will not stop the level of ammonia in your blood from becoming seriously high. high levels of ammonia leads to feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) or feeling confused. tell your doctor or go to the hospital straight away if you notice any of these signs. laboratory tests will be needed so your doctor can determine and maintain the correct dose for you. other medicines and ravicti tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. in particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines, which may be less effective when used with glycerol phenylbutyrate. if you take these medicines, you may need regular blood tests: midazolam and barbiturates - used for sedation, trouble sleeping or epilepsy contraceptives also, tell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines as they may increase the amount of ammonia in your body or change how glycerol phenylbutyrate works: corticosteroids - used to treat inflamed areas of the body valproate - a medicine for epilepsy haloperidol - used to treat some mental health problems probenecid - to treat high levels of uric acid in the blood which can cause gout ('hyper-uricaemia') lipase inhibitors (such as orlistat) used to treat obesity lipase in pancreatic replacement therapies if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before taking ravicti. pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding if you are pregnant, tell your doctor before you start taking ravicti. if you become pregnant while taking ravicti, talk to your doctor. ravicti should not be used during pregnancy, as a risk for your unborn baby cannot be excluded. if you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception, during treatment with ravicti. talk to your doctor about the best method of contraception for you. you should discuss with your physician before you plan to breast-feed while taking ravicti. a decision should be made whether to breast-feed or stop taking ravicti taking into account the benefit of the treatment for you and the benefit of breast-feeding for your baby. this is because ravicti may pass into breast milk and a risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. driving and using machines ravicti may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. when taking glycerol phenylbutyrate you

take ravicti", "Section_Content": "always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. you must follow a special low protein diet during treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate. this diet will be designed for you by your doctor and dietician. you must follow this diet carefully. you may need to take supplemental amino acid formulations. you will need to have treatment and to follow a diet throughout your life, unless you have a successful liver transplantation. how much to take your doctor will tell you how much ravicti you should take each day. your daily dose will depend on your size and weight, the amount of protein in your diet, and your overall urea cycle disorder condition. your doctor may give you a lower dose if you have kidney or liver problems. you will need regular blood tests so your doctor can determine the correct dose for you. your doctor might tell you to take ravicti more than 3 times each day. in small children, this may be 4 to 6 times a day. there must be at least 3 hours between each dose. taking this medicine your doctor will tell you how to take ravicti oral liquid. it can be taken in the following ways: by mouth through a tube that goes through your tummy ('abdomen') to the stomach - called a 'gastrostomy tube' through a tube that goes through your nose to the stomach - called a 'nasogastric tube' take ravicti by mouth unless otherwise directed by your doctor. ravicti and meals take ravicti with or straight after a meal. young children should be given the medicine during or straight after a feeding. measuring the dose use an oral syringe to measure your dose. you should have the medicine with the reclosable bottle cap adapter along with an oral syringe to administer the correct amount of glycerol phenylbutyrate. 1. open the bottle of ravicti by pushing down on the cap and twisting to the left. 2. twist the reclosable bottle cap adapter onto the bottle. 3. place the tip of the oral syringe into the reclosable bottle cap adapter. 4. turn the bottle upside down with the oral syringe still inserted. 5. fill the oral syringe by pulling the plunger back until the syringe is filled with the amount of glycerol phenylbutyrate liquid that your doctor has told you to take. \u2212 note: if possible, use the oral syringe ml size that is nearest to (but not smaller than) the recommended dose (for example, if the dose is 0.8 ml, use a 1 ml oral syringe). 6. tap the oral syringe to remove air bubbles, making sure you have filled it with the correct amount of liquid. 7. swallow the liquid from the oral syringe or attach the oral syringe to a gastrostomy or nasogastric tube. 8. important note: do not add or stir ravicti into larger volumes of liquid such as water or juice as ravicti is heavier than most liquids. mixing ravicti with large volumes of liquid may result in you not getting the full dose. 9. ravicti can be added to a small amount of soft foods, such as ketchup, medical formulas, apple sauce or squash puree. 10. if the volume of your oral syringe is smaller than your prescribed dose, you will have to repeat these steps to get your full dose. use one oral syringe for all doses taken each day. 11. after you take your full dose, have a drink of water to make sure no medicine is left in your mouth, or flush the gastrostomy or nasogastric tube with 10 ml of water using a new oral syringe. the syringe used to flush the gastrostomy or nasogastric tube shall not be used for measuring the dose of ravicti to avoid introduction of water into the medicine. 12. close the tab on the reclosable bottle cap adapter. 13. important note: do not rinse the reclosable bottle cap adapter or the oral syringe between daily doses as the introduction of water causes glycerol phenylbutyrate to degrade. if ravicti gets in contact with water, the liquid will become cloudy in appearance. store bottle and oral syringe in a clean, dry place between doses. 14. discard the oral syringe after the last dose of the day. do not re-use the oral syringe for measuring the dose of ravicti on another day. the reclosable bottle cap adapter can be used until the bottle is empty. a new reclosable bottle cap adapter should be used when a new bottle is opened. 15. remaining unused syringes should be kept for use with another bottle. each bottle should be discarded after 14 days. if you take more ravicti than you should if you take more of this medicine than you should, talk to a doctor. if you notice any of the following signs, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away as these may be signs of overdose or high ammonia: feeling sleepy, tired, light-headed or sometimes confused headache changes in taste problems hearing feeling disorientated less able to remember things existing neurological conditions may get worse if you forget to take ravicti if you forget a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. however, for adults, if the next dose is in less than 2 hours, then skip it and take your next dose as normal. for children: if the next dose is in less than 30 minutes, then skip it and give the next dose as normal. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. if you stop taking ravicti you will need to take this medicine and follow a special low protein diet throughout your life. do not stop taking glycerol phenylbutyrate without talking to your doctor.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
