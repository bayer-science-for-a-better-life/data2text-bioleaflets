This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIncruse Ellipta 55 micrograms inhalation powder, pre-dispensed \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single inhalation provides a delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece of the inhaler) of \n55 micrograms umeclidinium (equivalent to 65 micrograms of umeclidinium bromide) This \ncorresponds to a pre-dispensed dose of 62.5 micrograms umeclidinium equivalent to 74.2 micrograms \numeclidinium bromide. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach delivered dose contains approximately 12.5 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed (inhalation powder). \n \nWhite powder in a grey inhaler (Ellipta) with a light green mouthpiece cover and a dose counter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIncruse Ellipta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult \npatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults  \n\nThe recommended dose is one inhalation of umeclidinium bromide once daily.  \n \nIncruse Ellipta should be administered at the same time of the day each day to maintain \nbronchodilation. The maximum dose is one inhalation of umeclidinium bromide once daily. \n \nSpecial populations  \n\nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Incruse Ellipta \nhas not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution (see \n\n\n\n3 \n\nsection 5.2). \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Incruse Ellipta in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) in the \nindication for COPD. \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nIncruse Ellipta is for inhalation use only. \n \nThe following instructions for the 30 dose inhaler (30 day supply) also apply to the 7 dose inhaler (7 \nday supply). \n \nThe Ellipta inhaler contains pre-dispensed doses and is ready to use. \n \nThe inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The desiccant \nsachet should be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled. \n \nThe patient should be advised to not open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose. \n \nThe inhaler will be in the ‘closed’ position when it is first taken out of its sealed tray. The “Discard \nby” date should be written on the inhaler label in the space provided. The “Discard by” date is 6 weeks \nfrom the date of opening the tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be \ndiscarded after first opening.  \n \nIf the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicinal product, the dose will be lost. \nThe lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled. \n \nIt is not possible to accidentally take extra medicinal product or a double dose in one inhalation. \n \nInstructions for use: \n \na) Prepare a dose \n \nOpen the cover when ready to take a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. \n \nSlide the cover down until a “click” is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled. \n \nThe dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the “click” \nis heard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice. \n \nb) How to inhale the medicinal product \n \nThe inhaler should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable. But not \nbreathing out into the inhaler. \n \nThe mouthpiece should be placed between the lips and the lips should then be closed firmly around it. \nThe air vents should not be blocked with fingers during use. \n \n\n Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. This breath should be held in for as long as \npossible (at least 3-4 seconds). \n\n Remove the inhaler from the mouth. \n Breathe out slowly and gently. \n\n \nThe medicinal product may not be tasted or felt, even when using the inhaler correctly. \n \nThe mouthpiece of the inhaler may be cleaned using a dry tissue before closing the cover. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nc) Close the inhaler \n \nSlide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAsthma \nUmeclidinium bromide should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this \npatient population. \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm \nAdministration of umeclidinium bromide may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-\nthreatening. Treatment should be discontinued immediately if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs and \nalternative therapy instituted if necessary. \n \nDeterioration of disease \nUmeclidinium bromide is intended for the maintenance treatment of COPD. It should not be used for \nthe relief of acute symptoms, i.e. as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of \nbronchospasm. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator. \nIncreasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control. \nIn the event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with umeclidinium bromide, a re-evaluation of \nthe patient and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken.  \n \nCardiovascular effects \nCardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen \nafter the administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists including umeclidinium bromide. In \naddition, patients with clinically significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease were excluded from \nclinical studies. Therefore, umeclidinium bromide should be used with caution in patients with severe \ncardiovascular disorders, particularly cardiac arrhythmias. \n \nAntimuscarinic activity  \nConsistent with its antimuscarinic activity, umeclidinium bromide should be used with caution in \npatients with urinary retention or with narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal \nproduct. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nClinically significant interactions mediated by umeclidinium bromide at clinical doses are considered \nunlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. \n \nOther antimuscarinics  \nCo-administration of umeclidinium bromide with other long-acting muscarinic antagonists or \nmedicinal products containing this active substance has not been studied and is not recommended as it \nmay potentiate known inhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse reactions. \nMetabolic and transporter based interactions  \nUmeclidinium bromide is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The steady-state \npharmacokinetics of umeclidinium bromide were assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 \n(poor metabolisers). No effect on umeclidinium AUC or Cmax was observed at a dose 4-fold higher \n\n\n\n5 \n\nthan the therapeutic dose. An approximately 1.3-fold increase in umeclidinium bromide AUC was \nobserved at an 8-fold higher dose with no effect on umeclidinium bromide Cmax. Based on the \nmagnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when umeclidinium is \nco-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or when administered to subjects genetically deficient in \nCYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers). \n \nUmeclidinium bromide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The effect of the moderate \nP-gp inhibitor verapamil (240 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium \nbromide was assessed in healthy volunteers. No effect of verapamil was observed on umeclidinium \nbromide Cmax. An approximately 1.4-fold increase in umeclidinium bromide AUC was observed. \nBased on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant interaction is expected when \numeclidinium bromide is co-administered with P-gp inhibitors. \n \nOther medicinal products for COPD \nAlthough no formal in vivo interaction studies have been performed, inhaled umeclidinium bromide \nhas been used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short and long acting \nsympathomimetic bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids without clinical evidence of \ninteractions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of umeclidinium bromide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nUmeclidinium bromide should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother \njustifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether umeclidinium bromide is excreted in human milk. A risk to breastfed \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Incruse Ellipta \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of umeclidinium bromide on human fertility. Animal studies indicate \nno effects of umeclidinium bromide on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nUmeclidinium bromide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with Incruse Ellipta were nasopharyngitis and upper \nrespiratory tract infection. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe safety profile of umeclidinium bromide was evaluated from 1663 patients with COPD who \nreceived doses of 55 micrograms or greater for up to one year. This includes 576 patients who \nreceived the recommended dose of 55 micrograms once daily. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nThe frequencies assigned to the adverse reactions identified in the table below include crude incidence \nrates observed from four efficacy studies and the long-term safety study (which involved 1,412 \npatients who received umeclidinium bromide). \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nSystem Organ Class \n \n\nAdverse reactions Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations Nasopharyngitis \nUpper respiratory tract infection \nUrinary tract infection  \nSinusitis \nPharyngitis \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions including: \nRash, urticaria and pruritus \n\n \nUncommon \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \nDysgeusia  \nDizziness \n\nCommon \nUncommon \nNot Known \n\nEye disorders Glaucoma \nVision blurred \nEye pain \nIntraocular pressure increased \n\nNot known \nNot known \nRare \nNot known \n\nCardiac disorders Atrial fibrillation \nRhythm idioventricular \nSupraventricular tachycardia \nSupraventricular extrasystoles \nTachycardia \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nCommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders  \n\nCough Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Constipation \nDry mouth \n\ncommon \nUncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash Uncommon \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Urinary retention \nDysuria \n\nNot known \nNot known \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAn overdose of umeclidinium bromide will likely produce signs and symptoms consistent with the \nknown inhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse effects (e.g. dry mouth, visual accommodation \ndisturbances and tachycardia). \n \nIf overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as \nnecessary. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, anticholinergics, ATC code: \nR03BB07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nUmeclidinium bromide is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an \nanticholinergic). It is a quinuclidine derivative that is a muscarinic receptor antagonist with activity \nacross multiple muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes. Umeclidinium bromide exerts its \nbronchodilatory activity by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine with muscarinic \ncholinergic receptors on airway smooth muscle. It demonstrates slow reversibility at the human M3 \nmuscarinic receptor subtype in vitro and a long duration of action in vivo when administered directly \nto the lungs in pre-clinical models. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn a Phase III, 6-month study (DB2113373) Incruse Ellipta provided a clinically meaningful \nimprovement over placebo in lung function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second \n[FEV1]) over 24 hours following once daily administration, which was evident at 30 minutes following \nadministration of the first dose (improvement over placebo by 102 mL, p<0.001*). The mean peak \nimprovements in FEV1 within the first 6 hours following dosing relative to placebo were 130 ml \n(p<0.001*) at Week 24. There was no evidence for tachyphylaxis in the effect of Incruse Ellipta over \ntime. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology  \n \nThe effect of umeclidinium 500 micrograms (pre-dispensed) on the QT interval was evaluated in a \nplacebo- and moxifloxacin-controlled QT trial of 103 healthy volunteers. Following repeat doses of \numeclidinium 500 micrograms once daily for 10 days, no clinically relevant effect on prolongation of \nQT interval (corrected using the Fridericia method) or effects on heart rate were observed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe clinical efficacy of Incruse Ellipta administered once daily was evaluated in 904 adult patients \nwho received umeclidinium bromide or placebo from two pivotal Phase III clinical studies with a \nclinical diagnosis of COPD; a 12-week study (AC4115408) and a 24-week study (DB2113373). \n \nPivotal Efficacy Studies: \nEffects on lung function \nIn both of the pivotal 12-week and 24-week studies, Incruse Ellipta demonstrated statistically \nsignificant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function (as defined by change from \nbaseline trough FEV1 at Week 12 and Week 24 respectively, which was the primary efficacy endpoint \nin each study) compared with placebo (see Table 1). The bronchodilatory effects with Incruse Ellipta \ncompared with placebo were evident after the first day of treatment in both studies and were \nmaintained over the 12-week and 24-week treatment periods. \n \nThere was no attenuation of the bronchodilator effect over time. \n \n\n                                                      \n*A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison \nthat did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be \ninferred. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1:  Trough FEV1 (ml) at Week 12 and Week 24 (primary endpoint)  \n \nTreatment with Incruse \n\nEllipta 55 mcg \n \n\n12-Week Study \nTreatment difference1 \n\n95% Confidence interval \np-value \n\n24-Week Study \nTreatment difference1 \n\n95% Confidence interval \np-value \n\nVersus  \nPlacebo \n\n127  \n(52, 202) \n<0.001 \n\n115  \n(76, 155) \n<0.001 \n\nmcg = micrograms \n1.least squares mean (95% confidence interval)  \n \nIncruse Ellipta demonstrated a statistically significant greater improvement from baseline in weighted \nmean FEV1 over 0-6 hours post-dose at Week 12 compared with placebo (166 ml, p<0.001) in the 12-\nweek pivotal study.  Incruse Ellipta demonstrated a greater improvement from baseline in weighted \nmean FEV1 over 0-6 hours post-dose at Week 24 compared with placebo (150 ml, p<0.001*) in the 24-\nweek pivotal study. \n \nSymptomatic outcomes \nBreathlessness: \nIn the 12-week study, a statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in the TDI focal \nscore at Week 12 was not demonstrated for Incruse Ellipta (1.0 units, p=0.05). A statistically \nsignificant improvement compared with placebo in the TDI focal score at Week 24 was demonstrated \nfor Incruse Ellipta (1.0 units, p<0.001) in the 24-week study. \n \nThe proportion of patients who responded with at least the minimum clinically important difference \n(MCID) of 1 unit TDI focal score at Week 12 was greater for Incruse Ellipta (38%) compared with \nplacebo (15%) in the 12-week study. Similarly, a greater proportion of patients achieved 1 unit TDI \nfocal score for Incruse Ellipta (53%) compared with placebo (41%) at Week 24 in the 24-week study. \n \nHealth-related quality of life: \nIncruse Ellipta also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in health-related quality of \nlife measured using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as indicated by a reduction in \nSGRQ total score at Week 12 compared with placebo (-7.90 units, p<0.001) in the 12-week study.  A \ngreater improvement compared with placebo in the change from baseline in SGRQ total score at Week \n24 was demonstrated for Incruse Ellipta (-4.69 units, p<0.001) in the 24-week study. \n \nThe proportion of patients who responded with at least the MCID in SGRQ score (defined as a \ndecrease of 4 units from baseline) at Week 12 was greater for Incruse Ellipta 55 micrograms (44%) \ncompared with placebo (26%) in the 12-week study. Similarly, a greater proportion of patients \nachieved at least the MCID for Incruse Ellipta at Week 24 (44%) compared with placebo (34%) in the \n24-week study.  \n \nCOPD exacerbations \nIn the 24-week placebo-controlled study in patients with symptomatic COPD, Incruse Ellipta reduced \nthe risk of a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation by 40% compared with placebo (analysis of time to \nfirst exacerbation; Hazard Ratio 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0,  p=0.035*). The probability of having an \nexacerbation in patients receiving Incruse Ellipta at week 24 was 8.9% compared with 13.7% for \nplacebo. These studies were not specifically designed to evaluate the effect of treatments on COPD \nexacerbations and patients were withdrawn from the study if an exacerbation occurred. \n\n                                                      \n*A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison \nthat did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be \ninferred. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nUse of rescue medicinal product \nIn the 12-week study, Incruse Ellipta statistically significantly reduced the use of rescue medication \nwith salbutamol compared with placebo (on average a reduction of 0.7 puffs per day over Weeks 1-12, \np=0.025) and demonstrated a higher percentage of days when no rescue medication was needed (on \naverage 46.3%) compared with placebo (on average 35.2%; no formal statistical analysis was \nperformed on this endpoint). In the 24-week study treatment with Incruse Ellipta, the mean (SD) \nchange from baseline in the number of puffs of rescue salbutamol over the 24-week treatment period \nwas -1.4 (0.20) for placebo and -1.7 (0.16) for Incruse Ellipta (Difference = -0.3; 95% CI: -0.8, 0.2, \np=0.276). Patients receiving Incruse Ellipta had a higher percentage of days when no rescue \nmedication was needed (on average 31.1%) compared with placebo (on average 21.7%). No formal \nstatistical testing was performed on this endpoint. \n \nSupporting efficacy studies \nIn a randomised, double-blind, 52-week study (CTT116855, IMPACT) of 10,355 adult patients with \nsymptomatic COPD and a history of 1 or more moderate or severe exacerbations within the prior 12 \nmonths, treatment with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI \n99/55/22 micrograms) once daily as a single inhaler was compared with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n(FF/VI 99/22 micrograms) once daily as a single inhaler. The primary endpoint was annual rate of on-\ntreatment moderate and severe exacerbations in subjects treated with FF/UMC/VI compared with \nFF/VI. The mean annual rate of exacerbations was 0.91 and 1.07 for FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI \nrespectively (Rate Ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.90; p<0.001). \n \nAt Week 52, a statistically significant improvement in the least-squares (LS) mean change from \nbaseline in trough FEV1 was observed for FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI (mean change: +94 mL \nvs. -3 mL; treatment difference: 97 mL; 95% CI: 85, 109; p<0.001). \n \nIn two 12-week, placebo controlled studies (200109 and 200110), the addition of Incruse Ellipta to \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) (92/22 micrograms) once daily in adult patients with a clinical \ndiagnosis of COPD, resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the \nprimary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Day 85 compared to placebo plus FF/VI (124 mL 95% CI: 93, \n154; p<0.001and 122 mL 95% CI: 91, 152; p<0.001). \n \nImprovements in lung function were supported with reductions in use of salbutamol over Weeks 1-12 \n(-0.4 puffs per day (95% CI: -0.7, -0.2; p<0.001) and -0.3 puffs per day (95% CI: -0.5, -0.1; p=0.003)) \ncompared to placebo plus FF/VI but improvements in SGRQ at week 12 were not statistically \nsignificant (200109) or clinically relevant (200109 and 200110). The short duration of these two \nstudies and limited number of exacerbation events, preclude any conclusion regarding additional effect \nof Incruse Ellipta on COPD exacerbation rate. \n \nNo new adverse drug reactions were identified with the addition of Incruse Ellipta to FF/VI in these \nstudies. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIncruse Ellipta in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing inhaled administration of umeclidinium bromide in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurred at 5 to \n15 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium bromide was on average 13% of the \ndose, with negligible contribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled \numeclidinium bromide, steady state was achieved within 7 to 10 days with 1.5 to 1.8-fold \naccumulation. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration to healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution was 86 \nlitres. In vitro plasma protein binding in human plasma was on average 89%. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies showed that umeclidinium bromide is principally metabolised by cytochrome P450 \n2D6 (CYP2D6) and is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The primary metabolic \nroutes for umeclidinium bromide are oxidative (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by \nconjugation (glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range of metabolites with either reduced \npharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has not been established. Systemic \nexposure to the metabolites is low. \n \nElimination \nPlasma clearance following intravenous administration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous \nadministration, approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered \nradioactivity) was excreted in faeces by 192 hours post-dose. Urinary elimination accounted for 22% \nof the administered radiolabelled dose by 168 hours (27% of recovered radioactivity). The excretion of \nthe drug-related material in the faeces following intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. \nFollowing oral administration to healthy male subjects, total radioactivity was excreted primarily in \nfaeces (92% of the administered radiolabelled dose or 99% of the recovered radioactivity) by 168 \nhours post-dose. Less than 1% of the orally administered dose (1% of recovered radioactivity) was \nexcreted in urine, suggesting negligible absorption following oral administration. Umeclidinium \nbromide plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours, with 3% \nto 4% active substance excreted unchanged in urine at steady-state. \n \nCharacteristics in specific groups of subjects or patients \n \nElderly \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium bromide are \nsimilar between COPD patients 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \nSubjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30mL/min) showed no evidence of an \nincrease in systemic exposure to umeclidinium bromide (Cmax and AUC), and no evidence of altered \nprotein binding between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy volunteers. \n \nHepatic impairment \nSubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) showed no evidence of an increase \nin systemic exposure to umeclidinium bromide (Cmax and AUC), and no evidence of altered protein \nbinding between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers. Umeclidinium \nbromide has not been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nOther special populations \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that no dose adjustment is required for umeclidinium \nbromide based on the effect of age, race, gender, inhaled corticosteroid use or weight. A study in \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers showed no evidence of a clinically significant effect of CYP2D6 genetic \npolymorphism on systemic exposure to umeclidinium bromide. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. In nonclinical studies \nwith umeclidinium bromide, findings were those typically associated with the primary pharmacology \nof muscarinic receptor antagonists and/or local irritancy.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nToxicity to reproduction \n \nUmeclidinium bromide was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal study, \nsubcutaneous administration of umeclidinium bromide to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight \ngain and food consumption and slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in dams given \n180 micrograms/kg/day dose (approximately 80-times the human clinical exposure of umeclidinium \n55 micrograms, based on AUC). \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \nStep-by-step instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Incruse Ellipta is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Incruse Ellipta is \n \nIncruse Ellipta contains the active substance umeclidinium bromide, which belongs to a group of \nmedicines called bronchodilators. \n \nWhat Incruse Ellipta is used for \n \nThis medicine is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a \nlong-term condition in which the airways and air-sacs in the lungs gradually become blocked or \ndamaged, leading to breathing difficulties that slowly get worse. Difficulties in breathing is added to \nby tightening of the muscles around the airways, which narrows the airways and so restricts the flow \nof air. \n \nThis medicine blocks the tightening of these muscles, making it easier for air to get in and out of the \nlungs. When used regularly, it can help control your breathing difficulties and reduce the effects of \nCOPD on your everyday life. \n \nIncruse Ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. \nIf you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). If you \ndo not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. \n \n \n2.
