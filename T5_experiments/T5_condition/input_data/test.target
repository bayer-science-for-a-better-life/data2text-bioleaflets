wilzin belongs to a group of medicines called various alimentary tract and metabolism products . wilzin is indicated in the treatment of wilson ' s disease , which is a rare inherited defect in copper excretion . dietary copper , which cannot be properly eliminated , accumulates first in the liver , then in other organs such as the eyes and the brain . this potentially leads to liver damage and neurological disorders . wilzin blocks the absorption of copper from the intestine thereby preventing its transfer into the blood and its further accumulation in the body . unabsorbed copper is then eliminated in the stool . wilson ' s disease will persist during the entire lifetime of the patient and therefore the need for this treatment is life - long .

ambirix is a vaccine used in infants , children and young people from 1 year up to and including 15 years . it is used to prevent two diseases : hepatitis a and hepatitis b . hepatitis a : infection with the hepatitis a virus may cause the liver to become swollen ( inflamed ). the virus is usually caught from food or drink that contains the virus . however , it is sometimes caught in other ways , such as by swimming in water that has sewage in it or from another infected person . the virus is found in body fluids such as faeces , serum or saliva . symptoms begin 3 to 6 weeks after infection . some people can feel sick , have a fever and aches and pains . after a few days they may be very tired , and have dark urine , pale faeces , yellowish skin or eyes ( jaundice ). the severity and type of symptoms can vary . young children may not get all symptoms . most children recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to make children ill for about a month . hepatitis b : infection with the hepatitis b virus may cause the liver to become swollen ( inflamed ). the virus is usually caught from another infected person . it is found in body fluids such as blood , semen , vaginal secretions , or saliva ( spit ). symptoms may not be seen for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection . not always people who have been infected look or feel ill . some people can feel sick , have a fever and aches and pains . however , others can become very ill . they may be very tired , and have dark urine , pale faeces , yellowish skin or eyes ( jaundice ). some people may need to go into hospital . most adults fully recover from the disease , but some people ( particularly children ) who may not have had symptoms can remain infected . they are called hepatitis b " carriers " and can still infect other people throughout their lives . carriers are also at risk of serious liver problems , such as scarring ( cirrhosis ) or liver cancer . how ambirix works ambirix helps the body to produce its own protection ( antibodies ) against these diseases . the vaccine does not contain live virus ( see section 6 for the content of the vaccine ) and therefore cannot cause hepatitis a or b infections . as with all vaccines , some people respond less well to a vaccine than others . ambirix may not protect you from being ill if you have already caught the hepatitis a or b virus . ambirix can only help to protect you against infections with hepatitis a or b viruses . it cannot protect against other infections that can affect the liver even though these infections might have signs similar to those caused by the hepatitis a or b virus .

your doctor has given you nespo ( an anti - anaemic ) to treat your anaemia . anaemia is when your blood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue , weakness and shortness of breath . nespo works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin . erythropoietin is produced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells . the active substance of nespo is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene - technology in chinese hamster ovary cells ( cho - k1 ). if you have chronic renal failure nespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure ( kidney failure ) in adults and children . in kidney failure , the kidney does not produce enough of the natural hormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia . because it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells , it will be about four weeks before you notice any effect . your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of nespo to treat your anaemia . if you are receiving chemotherapy nespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non - bone marrow cancers ( non - myeloid malignancies ) who are receiving chemotherapy . one of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood cells . at first , only white blood cells seem to be affected . this is because the red blood cells have a much longer life span in the circulating blood . towards the end of your chemotherapy course , particularly if you have had a lot of chemotherapy , your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic .
