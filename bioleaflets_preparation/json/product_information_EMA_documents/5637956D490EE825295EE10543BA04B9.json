NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAFLUNOV suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe. \nZoonotic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted). \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInfluenza virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase)* of strain: \n \nA/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1)-like strain (NIBRG-23) (clade 2.2.1) 7.5 micrograms**  \nper 0.5 ml dose \n \n* propagated in fertilised hens’ eggs from healthy chicken flocks \n** expressed in microgram haemagglutinin. \n \nAdjuvant MF59C.1 containing: \nsqualene 9.75 milligrams per 0.5 ml \npolysorbate 80 1.175 milligrams per 0.5 ml \nsorbitan trioleate 1.175 milligrams per 0.5 ml \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nThe vaccine contains 1.899 milligrams of sodium and 0.081 milligrams of potassium per 0.5 ml dose.  \n \nAFLUNOV may contain trace residues of egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin, neomycin \nsulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide which are used during the manufacturing \nprocess (see section 4.3). \n \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe. \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActive immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. \n \nThis indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects from the age of 18 years \nonwards following administration of two doses of the vaccine containing \nA/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1)-like strain (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nAFLUNOV should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults and elderly (18 years of age and above): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nAFLUNOV has been evaluated in healthy adults (18-60 years of age) and healthy elderly \n(over 60 years of age) following a 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule, and booster vaccination \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nThere is limited experience in elderly over 70 years of age (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the event of an officially declared influenza pandemic due to A/H5N1 virus, persons previously \nvaccinated with one or two doses of AFLUNOV that contained haemagglutinin (HA) antigen derived \nfrom a different clade of the same influenza subtype as the influenza pandemic strain may receive a \nsingle dose of AFLUNOV instead of two doses that are required in previously unvaccinated \nindividuals (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of AFLUNOV in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \n \nCurrently available data in subjects aged 6 months to 18 years of age are described in section 5.1 but \nno recommendation on a posology can be made. \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide) of this vaccine. \n \nHowever, in a pandemic situation caused by the strain included in this vaccine, it may be appropriate \nto give this vaccine to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis as defined above, provided that \nfacilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 and to \nresidues (eggs and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunization shall be postponed in patients with febrile illness or acute infection. \n \nThe vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. \n \nThere are no data with AFLUNOV using the subcutaneous route of administration. Therefore, \nhealthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in \nindividuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular \ninjection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nProtection against influenza \nThere is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1).  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nBased on humoral immune responses to the vaccine strain A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 after two doses of \nAFLUNOV, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. In addition, antibody \nresponses in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to \nprovide protection. \nSome degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to \nthat of the vaccine strain. However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to H5N1 strains of \nother clades is unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nSince a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity or \nefficacy data to support interchangeability of AFLUNOV with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAFLUNOV may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, and \nimmunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of AFLUNOV with vaccines other than non-adjuvanted \nseasonal influenza vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation \nshould be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be \nintensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nhuman T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. \nThese transitory false positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nLimited data were obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with \nAFLUNOV or similar pandemic H1N1v vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1. \n \nHowever, it is estimated that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more than 90,000 women were \nvaccinated during pregnancy with Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to AFLUNOV) which \ncontains the same amount of adjuvant MF59C.1 as AFLUNOV. \n \nPost-marketing spontaneously reported adverse events and an interventional study do not suggest \ndirect or indirect harmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy. \n \nIn addition, two large observational studies designed to assess the safety of Focetria exposure in \npregnancy showed no increase in the rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, abortions, stillbirth, \nlow birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital malformations among almost 10,000 \nvaccinated pregnant women and their offspring compared with unvaccinated controls. \n \nSince AFLUNOV is expected not to be used in an emergency situation, its administration during \npregnancy might be deferred as a precautionary approach. \n \nHealthcare providers need to assess the benefit and potential risks of administering the vaccine to \npregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nThere are no data regarding the use of AFLUNOV during breast-feeding. The potential benefits \nto the mother and risks to the infant should be considered before administering AFLUNOV \nduring breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data concerning human fertility. A study in rabbits did not indicate reproductive or \ndevelopmental toxicity of AFLUNOV (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 may affect the ability to drive or operate \nmachinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe incidence of adverse reactions has been evaluated in seven clinical trials in healthy subjects \ninvolving over 4300 adults and elderly receiving AFLUNOV (at least 7.5 µg HA, adjuvanted). There \nwere 3872 subjects 18-60 years of age, 365 subjects 61-70 years of age, and 89 subjects greater \nthan 70 years of age. The safety profile across clinical studies using AFLUNOV containing either the \nA/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain is comparable. \n \nConsistent with the data observed by trial for solicited reactions, there was a general trend towards \ndecreased reports of local reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first injection. \nIrrespective of antigen dose, almost all systemic reactions were reported on the day of vaccination \n(day 1) or during the 3 days immediately following. \n \nData on safety of a booster dose of AFLUNOV are limited to three trials (V87P1, V87P2 and \nV87P1E1) that included 116 adults (18-60 years) and 56 elderly subjects (>61 years). No increase in \nreactions was reported when a booster dose was administered 6 months-18 months later, after the \ninitial dosing series. A slight increase in reactions in adults was reported when a booster dose was \nadministered 18 months after the initial dosing series. In the elderly, the reported reactions increased \nwith the third booster dose only when compared with the second dose. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reaction rates reported after any vaccination doses (i.e. 1st, 2nd or booster) were similar \nand are listed according to the following MedDRA frequency convention and system organ class: \n \nVery common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); Rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000). \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMedDRA System Organ class Very common \n(≥1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(≥1/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000) \n\nNervous system disorders Headache   Convulsions \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Nausea   \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Sweating Urticaria Eye swelling \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nMyalgia Arthralgia   \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nInjection site \nswelling, \nInjection site \npain, Injection \nsite induration, \nInjection site \nredness, Fatigue \n\nInjection site \necchymosis, \nFever, Malaise, \nShivering \n\nInfluenza like \nillness \n\nAnaphylaxis   \n\n \nThe majority of these side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nClinical trials in special populations \n \nAdverse reactions in special populations have been evaluated in two clinical trials, V87_25 and \nV87_26, involving adult (18-60 years) and elderly (≥ 61 years) subjects who were either healthy or \nwith underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive conditions. \n \n Study V87_25 Study V87_26 \n Medical conditions Healthy Immunocompromised Healthy \n\n \nAdults \n(20-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-84 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(19-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-79 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(20-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-84 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(18-59 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-91 \nyears)*  \n\nNo. of \nsubjects N=145 N=149 N=59 N=58 N=147 N=148 N=58 N=62 \n\n*actual age range of population enrolled \n \nAcross studies V87_25 and V87_26, the safety of AFLUNOV in healthy adult and elderly subjects \nwas consistent with existing safety data from previous clinical trials. However, in \nimmunocompromised subjects 18 through 60 years of age, slightly higher rates of nausea (13.0%) \nwere reported. In addition, higher rates of arthralgia (up to 23.3%) were reported in both adult and \nelderly subjects, who were immunocompromised or with underlying medical conditions. \n \nThe following solicited adverse reactions were additionally collected in these two studies and reported \nwith the following frequencies across subjects who received AFLUNOV irrespective of age or health \nstatus: diarrhoea (up to 11.9%), loss of appetite (up to 10.9%) and vomiting (up to 1.7%). In both \nstudies, subjects with underlying medical and immunosuppressive conditions reported higher \nfrequencies of diarrhoea, loss of appetite and vomiting compared to healthy subjects (irrespective of \nage).    \n \nPost-marketing surveillance \nNo post-marketing surveillance data are available following AFLUNOV administration. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nThe following adverse events were reported from post-marketing surveillance with Focetria (an H1N1 \npandemic vaccine similar to AFLUNOV) which contains the same amount of adjuvant MF59C.1 as \nAFLUNOV, approved for use in children 6 months of age and above, adults and the elderly: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nLymphadenopathy. \n \nImmune system disorders \nAllergic reactions, anaphylaxis including dyspnoea, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema, in rare cases \nleading to shock. \n \nNervous system disorders \nHeadache, dizziness, somnolence, syncope. Neurological disorders, such as neuralgia, paraesthesia, \nconvulsions and neuritis. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPalpitation, tachycardia. \nRespiratory disorders \nCough. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash; angioedema. \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nMuscular weakness, pain in extremities. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia. \nThe following additional adverse events were reported from post-marketing surveillance with seasonal \nnon-adjuvanted trivalent vaccines in all age groups and a seasonal trivalent MF59-adjuvanted subunit \ninfluenza vaccine approved for use in elderly subjects 65 years of age and older: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nThrombocytopenia (in some cases reversible platelet counts less than 5000 mm3). \n \nNervous system disorders \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, and Guillain Barré syndrome. \n \nVascular disorders \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nErythema multiforme. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nExtensive swelling of injected limb lasting more than one week, injection-site cellulitis-like reaction \n(some cases of swelling, pain, and redness extending more than 10 cm and lasting more than 1 week). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe incidence of AFLUNOV (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) adverse reactions has been evaluated in one \nclinical trial (V87P6) in children (6 months to 17 years old). Regardless of age, reactogencity was \nhigher after the first dose than after the second vaccination. Reactogenicity after the third dose, \n\n\n\n8 \n\nadministered 12 months following the first dose, was higher than after both first and second doses. The \npercentages of subjects reporting local reactions were higher in the older age groups, mainly due to the \nhigher reports for pain. In toddlers, erythema and tenderness were the most commonly reported \nsolicited local reactions; irritability and unusual crying were the most commonly reported solicited \nsystemic reactions. In children and adolescents, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local \nreaction, and fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions. \nAcross all ages, low percentages of subjects reported fever. \n \n\n Injection 1 Injection 2 Injection 3 \n AFLUNOV AFLUNOV AFLUNOV \nToddlers (6-<36 months) N=145 N=138 N=124 \nAny 76% 68% 80% \nLocal 47% 46% 60% \nSystemic 59% 51% 54% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 0% 0% 0% \nAny Other Adverse Event 54% 49% 35% \nChildren (3-<9 years) N=96 N=93 N=85 \nAny 72% 68% 79% \nLocal 66% 58% 74% \nSystemic 32% 33% 45% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 4%  2%  6%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 36% 31% 19% \nAdolescents(9-<18 years) N=93 N=91 N=83 \nAny 91% 82% 89% \nLocal 81% 70% 81% \nSystemic 69% 52% 69% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 0%  1%  2%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 30% 27% 22% \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

In both trials, immunogenicity of AFLUNOV \nwas shown by HI, SRH and MN assays following both the first and second dose.  \n\nGeometric mean area*, seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for \nanti-HA antibody to H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 measured by SRH assays 21 days after the 2nd \ndose were as follows: \n\na  actual age range of population enrolled \n*  measured by SRH assay seroprotection: SRH area ≥25 mm2, seroconversion: SRH area ≥25 mm2 for subjects with a \n\nbaseline SRH area ≤4 mm2 or a minimum 50% increase in SRH area for subjects with >4 mm2. \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n\n \n\nStudy V87_25 \n\n \nAdults \n\n (20- 60 years)a  \nAdults  \n\n(19- 60 years)a \nElderly  \n\n(61-84 years)a \n \n\nElderly \n(61-79 years)a \n\n \n\nAnti-HA antibody \n(SRH) \n\nMedical \nConditions \n\nN=140 \n\nHealthy \nN=57 \n\nMedical \nConditions \n\nN=143 \n\nHealthy \nN=57 \n\nGeometric Mean \nArea (95%CI)* \n\n31.07 \n(27.43-35.19) \n\n58.02 \n(48.74-69.06) \n\n29.34 \n(26.07-33.01) \n\n27.78 \n(22.57-34.18) \n\nSeroprotection rate \n(95%CI)* \n\n65.00 \n(56.5-72.9) \n\n89.47 \n(78.5-96) \n\n58.74 \n(50.2-66.9) \n\n57.89 \n(44.1-70.9) \n\nSeroconversion rate \n(95%CI)* \n\n72.86 \n(64.7-80) \n\n98.25 \n(90.6-99.96) \n\n64.34 \n(55.9-72.2) \n\n66.67 \n(52.9-78.6) \n\nSeroconversion \nfactor (95%CI)** \n\n3.33 \n(2.94-3.77) \n\n6.58 \n(5.53-7.83) \n\n2.37 \n(2.10-2.66) \n\n2.96 \n(2.41-3.64) \n\nStudy V87_26 \n\n \nAdults  \n\n(20- 60 years)a   \nAdults \n\n(18-59 years)a \nElderly  \n\n(61-84 years)a \n \n\nElderly  \n(61-91 years)a \n\n \n\nAnti-HA antibody \n(SRH) \n\nImmuno- \ncompromised \n\nN=143 \n\nHealthy \nN=57 \n\nImmuno- \ncompromised \n\nN=139 \n\nHealthy \nN=62 \n\nGeometric Mean \nArea (95%CI)* \n\n26.50 \n(22.49-31.22) \n\n48.58 \n(40.01-58.99) \n\n26.85 \n(23.01-31.33) \n\n23.91 \n(18.89-30.26) \n\nSeroprotection rate \n(95%CI)* \n\n60.84 \n(52.3-68.9) \n\n87.72 \n(76.3-94.9) \n\n58.99 \n(50.3-67.3) \n\n53.23 \n(40.1-66) \n\nSeroconversion rate \n(95%CI)* \n\n61.54 \n(53-69.5) \n\n89.47 \n(78.5-96) \n\n64.75 \n(56.2-72.7) \n\n56.45 \n(43.3-69 \n\nSeroconversion \nfactor (95%CI)** \n\n3.16 \n(2.69-3.73) \n\n7.10 \n(5.85-8.62) \n\n3.15 \n(2.70-3.68) \n\n2.83 \n(2.24-3.58) \n\n\n\n14 \n\nHI results for the two clinical studies revealed lower values than those reported in previous studies. \nSeroconversion rates against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 ranged from 37.50% to 43.10% in \nhealthy adults, and from 19.18% to 26.47% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying medical \nconditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 21.43% to 30.65% in healthy elderly \nsubjects, and from 24.49% to 27.86% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or underlying \nmedical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies. \n \nMN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroconversion rate of 66.67% in \nhealthy adults, and ranging from 33.57% to 54.14% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying \nmedical conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 24.39% to 29.03% in healthy \nelderly subjects, and from 31.65% to 39.42% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or \nunderlying medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies. \n \nIn both studies V87_25 and V87_26, the lower levels of antibodies (as measured by HI, SRH and MN \nassays) and reduced seroprotection rates in adults and elderly (≥ 61 years old) subjects with underlying \nmedical or immunosuppressive conditions, suggest that AFLUNOV may not elicit the same level of \nprotection against A/H5N1 strain as compared to healthy adults (see section 4.4). These studies \nprovided limited immunogenicity data in subjects with some underlying medical (in particular, renal \nimpairment and peripheral cardiovascular disease) and immunosuppressive conditions (in particular, \ntransplant recipients and patients under cancer treatment). In these trials, lower levels of antibodies \nand reduced seroprotection rates against homologous H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were also \nmeasured in healthy elderly subjects, as compared to healthy adults, though previous studies showed \ninduction of sufficiently immunogenic responses against H5N1 strains (see above for information on \nelderly). \n \nAvailable data in paediatric population \n \nA clinical trial (V87P6) was conducted with AFLUNOV (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) in 471 children \nfrom 6 months to 17 years of age. Two doses of AFLUNOV were administered three weeks apart and \na third dose 12 months following the first dose. After 3 weeks from the 2nd vaccination (day 43) all age \ngroups (i.e. 6-35 months, 3-8 years and 9-17 years) achieved high levels of antibodies to \n(A/Vietnam/1194/2004) as evaluated with SRH and HI assays as presented in table below.

See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \nInformation from non-clinical studies \nEfficacy against challenge with virus homologous and heterologous to vaccine strains was evaluated \nin the ferret model. AFLUNOV(A/Vietnam/1194/2004) and an AFLUNOV-like H5N1 vaccine \n(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005-like) were tested. Animals received one or two doses of vaccine \ncontaining 3.75 or 7.5 micrograms of antigen, followed by challenge with a lethal dose of \nA/Vietnam/1203/04 virus.  \n \nAll animals receiving 2 doses of AFLUNOV were protected, and 94% of animals receiving a single \ndose of AFLUNOV were protected. 87% of animals challenged with virus heterologous to the vaccine \nstrain after 2 doses of vaccine were protected, and a single dose of heterologous vaccine \nprotected 56% of the animals.  \n \nIn a similar study, intranasal challenge was delayed until approximately 4 months after the second \ndose of vaccine was administered. In this study 100% of animals were protected against homologous \nchallenge, and 81% of animals were protected against heterologous challenge. Vaccination protected \nanimals from lethal challenge even when HI antibody titres were low or undetectable. \n \nEfficacy against challenge with the heterologous virus A/Indonesia/5/2005 was also tested. Ferrets \nreceived one or two doses of vaccine (A/Vietnam/1194/2004). Two doses of vaccine protected 92% of \nanimals, and a single dose of vaccine protected 50% of animals against challenge with the \nA/Indonesia/5/2005 virus. Lung damage was reduced in vaccinated groups. Viral shedding and viral \ntitres in lungs were also reduced, suggesting that vaccination may reduce the risk of viral transmission. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data obtained with AFLUNOV and with seasonal influenza vaccine containing \nMF59C.1 adjuvant reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated \ndose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, and reproductive and developmental toxicity \n(through the end of the lactation period). \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What AFLUNOV is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive AFLUNOV \n3. How AFLUNOV is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store AFLUNOV \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What AFLUNOV is and what it is used for \n \nAFLUNOV is a vaccine for use in adults from 18 onwards, intended to be given in the context of \noutbreaks of zoonotic influenza viruses (coming from birds) with pandemic potential to prevent flu \ncaused by H5N1 viruses similar to the vaccine strain reported in section 6.  \n \nZoonotic influenza viruses occasionally infect humans, and can cause disease ranging from mild upper \nrespiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome, shock and even death. Human infections are primarily caused by contact with \ninfected animals, but do not spread easily between people. \n \nAFLUNOV is intended also to be given when there is anticipation of a possible pandemic due to the \nsame or a similar strain. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine \ncan cause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, AFLUNOV may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive AFLUNOV \n \nYou should not receive AFLUNOV: \n \n• if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of \n\nAFLUNOV (listed in section 6) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts \nas follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, kanamycin and neomycin \nsulphate (antibiotics) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Signs of an allergic \nreaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. \nHowever, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for you to be vaccinated with \nAFLUNOV provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in case of an \nallergic reaction. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine \n \n• if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, \nkanamycin and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) \n(see section 6. Further information); \n\n \n• if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could \nstill be vaccinated with AFLUNOV; \n\n \n• if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \n\nfew weeks after vaccination with AFLUNOV the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell \nthe doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given AFLUNOV. \n\n \n• in the presence of immune deficiencies AFLUNOV may be administered but a protective \n\nimmune response may not be elicited. \n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nFainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if \nyou fainted with a previous injection. \n \nAFLUNOV may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially elderly subjects and those \nwith weakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with underlying long term medical \nproblems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a weak \nimmune system or an underlying long term medical problem.  \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and AFLUNOV \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. \n \nData obtained in adults showed that AFLUNOV can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted \nseasonal influenza vaccines. There is no information on administration of AFLUNOV with non-\ninfluenza vaccines. If administration of AFLUNOV with other vaccines can not be avoided, the \nvaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should be aware that the side \neffects may be more intense. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or nurse for advice before receiving this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits \nand potential risks of giving you the vaccine.   \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome effects mentioned under section 4. “Possible side effects” may affect the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nAFLUNOV contains sodium and potassium. \n \nAFLUNOV contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) \nper 0.5 ml dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n \n \n3.
