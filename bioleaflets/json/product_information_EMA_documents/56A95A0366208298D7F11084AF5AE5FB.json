NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nNamuscla 167 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach capsule contains mexiletine hydrochloride corresponding to 166.62 mg mexiletine . \n\n  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule (capsule). \n\n \n\nNamuscla capsules are Swedish orange hard shell gelatin capsules (20 mm) filled with white powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications   \n\n \n\nNamuscla is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of myotonia in adult patients with non-\n\ndystrophic myotonic disorders. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of mexiletine is 167 mg daily (1 capsule per day). After at least \n\n1 week of treatment, based on the clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 333 mg daily \n\n(2 capsules per day). After at least 1 further week of treatment, based on clinical response, dose can be \n\nfurther increased to 500 mg daily (3 capsules per day).  \n\nMaintenance treatment is between 167 mg – 500 mg daily (1 to 3 capsules per day), according to the \n\nintensity of symptoms and the clinical response, taken regularly throughout the day. \n\n \n\nThe dose should not exceed 500 mg/day. Regular reassessment should be implemented, not to \n\ncontinue long-term treatment in a patient not responding or not experiencing benefit of the treatment.  \n\nBefore starting mexiletine treatment, detailed and careful cardiac evaluation should be carried out; \n\nthroughout treatment with mexiletine, cardiac monitoring needs to be continued and adapted as a \n\nfunction of the heart condition of the patient (see contraindications in section 4.3 and warning in \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with cardiac disorders \n\nIn case of modification of the mexiletine dose, or if medicinal products susceptible to affect cardiac \n\nconduction are co-administered with mexiletine, patients should be closely monitored by ECG \n\n(especially patients with conduction anomalies) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nExperience with mexiletine in patients with myotonic disorders aged > 65 years is limited. Based on \n\nthe pharmacokinetic properties of mexiletine, no dosage adjustment is required in patients aged 65 \n\nyears and over.  \n\n \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nMexiletine should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In these \n\npatients, it is recommended that the dose should only be increased after at least 2 weeks of treatment. \n\nMexiletine should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n\nThe experience with mexiletine in patients with severe renal impairment is limited. Therefore, the use \n\nof mexiletine is not recommended in this patient population (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of mexiletine in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nPoor and extensive CYP2D6 metabolisers \n\nPatients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers may exhibit higher mexiletine blood levels (see section \n\n5.2). A period of at least 7 days before dose increase must be respected to ensure that steady-state \n\nlevels are reached, irrespective of the patient’s CYP450 polymorphism.   \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\n \n\nThe capsules should be swallowed with water, avoiding the supine position. In case of digestive \n\nintolerance, capsules should be taken during a meal. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Hypersensitivity to any local anaesthetic  \n• Ventricular tachyarrhythmia \n• Complete heart block (i.e. third-degree atrioventricular block) or any heart block susceptible to \n\nevolve to complete heart block (first-degree atrioventricular block with markedly prolonged PR \n\ninterval (≥ 240 ms) and/or wide QRS complex (≥ 120 ms), second-degree atrioventricular block, \n\nbundle branch block, bifascicular and trifascicular block),  \n\n• Myocardial infarction (acute or past), or abnormal Q-waves \n• Symptomatic coronary artery disease  \n• Heart failure with mid-range (40-49%) and reduced (<40%) ejection fraction  \n• Atrial tachyarrhythmia, fibrillation or flutter \n• Sinus node dysfunction (including sinus rate < 50 bpm) \n• Co-administration with medicinal products inducing torsades de pointes (see section 4.5) \n• Co-administration with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic index (see section 4.5). \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nCardiac arrhythmogenic effects \n\n \n\nMexiletine may induce an arrhythmia or accentuate a pre-existing arrhythmia, either diagnosed or \n\nundiagnosed. See also sections 4.3 and 4.5 regarding association with other products with \n\narrhythmogenic effects.  \n\n \n\nBefore starting mexiletine treatment, detailed and careful cardiac evaluation (ECG, 24-48-hour Holter-\n\nmonitoring and echocardiography) should be carried out in all patients in order to determine the \n\ncardiac tolerability of mexiletine. A cardiac evaluation is recommended shortly after treatment start \n\n(e.g. within 48 hours). \n\n \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n4 \n\nThroughout treatment with mexiletine, and in relation with dose changes, cardiac monitoring of \n\npatients needs to be adapted as a function of the heart condition of the patient: \n\n \n\n• In patients without cardiac abnormalities, periodic ECG monitoring is recommended (every \n2 years or more frequently if considered necessary). \n\n• In patients with cardiac abnormalities, and in patients prone to such abnormalities, detailed \ncardiac evaluation, including ECG, should be carried out before and after any dose increase. \n\nDuring maintenance treatment, detailed cardiac evaluation, including ECG, 24-48 hour Holter-\n\nmonitoring and echocardiography, is recommended at least annually, or more frequently if \n\nconsidered necessary as part of routine cardiac assessment.  \n\n \n\nPatients should be informed about the presenting symptoms of arrhythmias (fainting, palpitation, chest \n\npain, shortness of breath, light-headedness, lipothymia, and syncope) and should be advised to \n\nimmediately contact an emergency centre if there are any symptoms of arrhythmias.  \n\n \n\nFor cardiac disorders not listed in section 4.3, the benefit of the antimyotonic effects of mexiletine \n\nneeds to be balanced against the risk of cardiac complications on a case by case basis. \n\nMexiletine should be stopped immediately in case any cardiac conduction abnormalities or any of the \n\ncontraindications listed in the section 4.3 are detected. \n\n \n\nElectrolytic imbalance such as hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may increase the \n\nproarrhythmic effects of mexiletine. Therefore, electrolytic evaluation should be done prior to \n\ninitiating therapy with mexiletine in every patient. Electrolyte imbalance needs to be corrected before \n\nadministering mexiletine and to be monitored throughout treatment (with a periodicity to be adapted \n\npatient by patient). \n\n \n\nDrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \n\n \n\nDRESS refers to a syndrome which includes in its complete form severe cutaneous eruptions, fever, \n\nlymphadenopathy, hepatitis, haematological abnormalities with eosinophilia and atypical \n\nlymphocytes, and can involve other organs. Symptoms typically occur 1-8 weeks after exposure to the \n\nmedicinal product. Severe systemic manifestations are responsible for a 10% mortality rate. Incidence \n\nof DRESS has been reported between 1:100 and 1:10.000 patients treated.  \n\nSeveral medicinal products including anticonvulsants, antibiotics and also mexiletine have been \n\nidentified as possible causes. Patients with known hypersensitivity to mexiletine or any other \n\ningredients of this product or to any local anaesthetic are at high risk of developing DRESS and should \n\nnot receive mexiletine. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\n \n\nThe experience with mexiletine in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Therefore, \n\nmexiletine should not be used in this patient population (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\n \n\nThe experience with mexiletine in patients with severe renal impairment is limited. Therefore, the use \n\nof mexiletine is not recommended in this patient population (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nEpilepsy \n\n \n\nEpileptic patients need to be monitored because mexiletine can increase the frequency of seizure \n\nepisodes.  \n\n \n\nCYP2D6 polymorphism \n\n \n\nCYP2D6 polymorphism may affect mexiletine pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). Higher systemic \n\nexposure is expected in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers or who take medicinal products \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n5 \n\nthat inhibit CYP2D6 (see section 4.5). A period of at least 7 days before dose increase must be \n\nrespected to ensure that steady-state levels are reached and that mexiletine is well tolerated in all \n\npatients, irrespective of CYP450 polymorphism.    \n\n \n\nSmoking \n\n \n\nSmoking affects mexiletine pharmacokinetics (see section 4.5). Mexiletine dose may need to be \n\nincreased if a patient starts to smoke and decreased if a patient stops to smoke. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\n \n\nAntiarrhythmics inducing torsades de pointes (class Ia, Ic, III antiarrhythmics): \n\nCo-administration of mexiletine and antiarrhythmics inducing torsades de pointes (class Ia: quinidine, \n\nprocainamide, disopyramide, ajmaline; class Ic: encainide, flecainide, propafenone, moricizine; class \n\nIII: amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, dronedarone, vernakalant) increases the risk of \n\npotentially lethal torsades de pointes. The concomitant use of mexiletine and antiarrhythmic medicines \n\ninducing torsades de pointes is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nOther antiarrhythmics (class Ib, II, IV antiarrhythmics): \n\nCo-administration of mexiletine and other classes of antiarrhythmics (class Ib: lidocaine, phenytoin, \n\ntocainide; class II: propranolol, esmolol, timolol, metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol, bisoprolol, \n\nnebivolol; class IV: verapamil, diltiazem) is not recommended, unless exceptionally, because of the \n\nincreased risk of adverse cardiac reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nEffect of other medicinal products on mexiletine \n\n \n\nMexiletine is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving hepatic enzymes; inhibition or \n\ninduction of these enzymes is expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 & CYP2D6 inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of mexiletine with a hepatic enzyme inhibitor (CYP1A2 inhibitor: ciprofloxacin, \n\nfluvoxamine, propafenone; CYP2D6 inhibitor: propafenone, quinidine) significantly increases \n\nmexiletine exposure and thus the associated risk of adverse reactions to mexiletine.  \n\nIn a single-dose interaction study, the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38% following the co-\n\nadministration of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2.  \n\nTherefore, clinical and ECG monitoring, as well as adaptation of mexiletine dosage may be indicated \n\nthroughout and after treatment with a CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 & CYP2D6 inducers \n\nCo-administration of mexiletine with a hepatic enzyme inducer (CYP1A2 inducer: omeprazole; \n\nCYP2D6 inducer: phenytoin, rifampicin) may increase the clearance and elimination rate of \n\nmexiletine due to an increased hepatic metabolism, resulting in decreased plasmatic concentrations \n\nand half-life of mexiletine. \n\nIn a clinical study, co-administration of mexiletine with phenytoin resulted in a significant decrease in \n\nexposure to mexiletine (p < 0.003) due to enhanced clearance as reflected in significantly decreased \n\nelimination half-life (17.2 to 8.4 hours, p < 0.02). \n\nTherefore, based on the clinical response, the mexiletine dosage should be adapted during and after \n\ntreatment with the enzyme inducer.  \n\n \n\nAfter the oral administration of single (167 mg) and multiple (83 mg twice a day during 8 days) doses \n\nof mexiletine, total clearance of mexiletine is significantly increased in smokers (1.3 to 1.7-fold) due \n\nto induction of CYP1A2, resulting in a correspondingly decreased elimination half-life and drug \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n6 \n\nexposure. Mexiletine dose may need to be increased if a patient starts to smoke during mexiletine \n\ntreatment and decreased if a patient stops smoking.  \n\n \n\nEffect of mexiletine on other medicinal products  \n\n \n\nThe potential of mexiletine as a drug-drug-interaction perpetrator is unknown. Patients should be \n\ncarefully monitored if co-treated with other medicinal products with especially emphasis to medicinal \n\nproducts with narrow therapeutic windows. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 substrates \n\nMexiletine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2; therefore, co-administration of mexiletine with medicinal \n\nproducts metabolised by CYP1A2 (such as theophylline, caffeine, lidocaine or tizanidine) may be \n\nassociated with elevations in plasma concentrations of the concomitant medicine that could increase or \n\nprolong the therapeutic efficacy and/or the adverse reactions, especially if mexiletine is co-\n\nadministered with CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic window, e.g. theophylline and \n\ntizanidine. \n\nThe CYP1A2 substrate blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the mexiletine dose is \n\nchanged. An appropriate adjustment in the dose of the CYP1A2 substrate should be considered.  \n\n \n\n \n\nCaffeine \n\nIn a clinical study in 12 subjects (5 healthy subjects and 7 patients with cardiac arrhythmias), the \n\nclearance of caffeine was decreased by 50% following the administration of mexiletine. Increased \n\nconcentrations of caffeine occurring with the co-administration of mexiletine may be of concern in \n\npatients with cardiac arrhythmia. It is, therefore, recommended to reduce caffeine intake during \n\ntreatment with mexiletine. \n\n \n\nOCT2 substrates \n\nThe organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) provides an important pathway for the uptake of cationic \n\ncompounds in the kidney. Mexiletine may interact with drugs transported by OCT2 (such as \n\nmetformin and dofetilide). \n\nIf mexiletine and other OCT2 substrates are to be used concurrently, the OCT2 substrate blood levels \n\nshould be monitored, particularly when the mexiletine dose is changed. An appropriate adjustment in \n\nthe dose of the OCT2 substrate should be considered.  \n\n \n\nSubstrates of other enzymes and transporters \n\nThe potential interactions between mexiletine and substrates of other common enzymes and \n\ntransporters have not yet been assessed; it is currently contra-indicated to use mexiletine with any \n\nsubstrate having a narrow therapeutic window such as digoxin, lithium, phenytoin, theophylline or \n\nwarfarin (see section 4.3).  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of mexiletine in pregnant women. Limited clinical \n\ndata of the use of mexiletine in pregnant women shows that mexiletine crosses the placenta and \n\nreaches the foetus. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \n\nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of mexiletine during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nMexiletine is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of mexiletine in \n\nnewborns/infants. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n7 \n\ndiscontinue/abstain from mexiletine therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the \n\nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe effects of mexiletine on fertility in humans have not been studied. Animal studies with mexiletine \n\ndo not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nMexiletine may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, confusion, \n\nblurred vision may occur following administration of mexiletine (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with mexiletine are abdominal pain \n\n(12%), vertigo (8%) and insomnia (12%).  \n\nThe most serious reported adverse reactions in patients treated with mexiletine are drug reaction with \n\neosinophilia and systemic symptoms and arrhythmia (atrioventricular block, arrhythmia, ventricular \n\nfibrillation).  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nFrequency categories are derived according to the following conventions: very common (≥ 1/10), \n\ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \n\nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Very common and \n\ncommon adverse reactions are derived from data from the MYOMEX study; less common adverse \n\neffects are derived from post-marketing data. \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nNot known: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nVery rare: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms \n\nNot known: lupus-like syndrome, dermatitis exfoliative, Stevens-Johnson syndrome  \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nVery common: insomnia \n\nCommon: somnolence \n\nNot known: hallucinations, confusional state \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon: headache, paraesthesia, vision blurred \n\nUncommon: seizure, speech disorders \n\nNot known: diplopia, dysgeusia \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nCommon: vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon: tachycardia \n\nUncommon: bradycardia \n\nNot known: atrioventricular block  \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon: flushing, hypotension \n\nNot known: circulatory collapse, hot flush \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nNot known: pulmonary fibrosis \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n8 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common: abdominal pain \n\nCommon: nausea \n\nNot known: diarrhoea, vomiting, oesophageal ulcers and perforation \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nRare: hepatic function abnormal \n\nVery rare: drug-induced liver injury, liver disorder, hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nCommon: acne \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon: pain in the extremities \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon: fatigue, asthenia, chest discomfort, malaise \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nFatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses at 4.4 g of mexiletine hydrochloride ingestion \n\nbut survival has also been reported following acute overdose of approximately 4 g of oral mexiletine \n\nhydrochloride. \n\n \n\nThe symptoms of mexiletine overdose include neurological disorders (paresthesia, confusion, \n\nhallucination, seizure) and cardiac disorders (sinusal bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and in \n\nextreme cases, cardiac arrest). \n\n \n\nOverdose management \n\n \n\nThe treatment is mainly symptomatic. The seriousness of the symptoms may require hospital \n\nsupervision. In case of bradycardia with hypotension, intravenous atropine should be used.  In case of \n\nseizure, benzodiazepines should be used. \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cardiac therapy, antiarrhythmics, class Ib, ATC code: C01BB02. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nMexiletine blocks sodium channels with a stronger potency in situations of excessive burst of action \n\npotentials (use-dependent block) and/or prolonged depolarization (voltage-dependent block), as \n\noccurring in diseased tissues, rather than on physiological excitability (resting or tonic block). \n\nMexiletine is, therefore, mostly active on muscle fibres subject to repeated discharges (such as skeletal \n\nmuscles). It improves myotonic symptoms by decreasing muscle stiffness through reduction of the \n\ndelay of muscle relaxation.  \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n9 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of mexiletine in non-dystrophic myotonia was evaluated in MYOMEX, a \n\nmulti-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over (2 treatment periods of 18 days) study with \n\na 4-day wash-out period in 13 patients with myotonia congenita (MC) and 12 patients with \n\nparamyotonia congenita (PC). Age of the overall study population ranged from 20 to 66 years old and \n\nabout 2/3 of the patients were male. Patients who experienced myotonic symptoms that involved at \n\nleast 2 segments and that had an impact on at least 3 daily activities were included into the study. The \n\npatients were randomized according to a cross-over design to a sequence including the 2 following \n\ntreatments: a) mexiletine, started at 167 mg/day and titrated by increments of 167 mg every 3 days to \n\nreach a maximum dose of 500 mg/day in 1 week or b) placebo.1  \n\nThe primary efficacy measure for both MC and PC was the score of stiffness severity as self-reported \n\nby the patients on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is constructed as an absolute measure, \n\nwith a 100 mm straight horizontal line having the endpoints “no stiffness at all” (0) and “worst \n\npossible stiffness” (100). The main secondary endpoints were changes in health–related quality of life \n\nas measured by individualised neuromuscular quality of life (INQoL) scale and the time needed to \n\nstand up from a chair, walk around the chair and sit down again (chair test). \n\nResults for the primary and key secondary endpoints are summarised in the table below. \n\n \n\n Mexiletine Placebo \n\nPrimary Analysis \n\nStiffness score (VAS) (mm) \n\n  \n\nNumber of subjects 25 25 \n\nMedian VAS value at Baseline 71.0 81.0 \n\nMedian VAS value at Day 18 16.0 78.0 \n\nMedian VAS absolute change from baseline -42.0 2.0 \n\nPercentage of Patients with an Absolute VAS  \n\nChange from Baseline ≥ 50 mm at Day 18 \n\n12/21 (57.1%) 3/22 (13.6%) \n\nEffect of treatment (Mixed Effect Linear Model) p < 0.001 \n\nSecondary Analysis \n\nChair test (s) \n\n  \n\nNumber of subjects 25 25 \n\nMean (SD) value at Baseline 7.3 (3.5) \n\nMean (SD) value at Day 18 5.2 (1.6) 7.5 (4.1) \n\nMean (SD) absolute change from baseline -2.1 (2.9) 0.2 (1.6) \n\nEffect of treatment (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) p = 0.0007 \n\nSecondary Analysis \n\nIndividualised neuromuscular quality of life – Overall quality of \n\nlife \n\n  \n\nNumber of subjects 25 25 \n\nMedian value at Baseline 51.1 \n\nMedian value at Day 18 23.3 48.3 \n\nMedian absolute change from baseline -25.0 1.1 \n\nEffect of treatment (linear mixed model) p < 0.001 \n\nSecondary Analysis \n\nClinical Global Impression (CGI) Efficacy index \n\n  \n\nNumber of subjects 25 25 \n\nCGI as judged efficient by the investigators 22 (91.7%) 5 (20.0%) \n\nCGI as judged efficient by the patients 23 (92.0%) 6 (24.0%) \n\nEffect of treatment (Mc Nemar test) p < 0.001 \n\nSecondary Analysis   \n\n \n1 Clinical Study Report refers to 200 mg dose which is the amount of mexiletine hydrochloride (corresponding to \n\n166.62mg mexiletine base) \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n10 \n\nPreference between the 2 treatment periods \n\nNumber of subjects 25 25 \n\nPeriod preferred 20 (80.0%) 5 (20.0%) \n\nEffect of treatment (binomial test) p = 0.0041 \n\nSecondary Analysis \n\nClinical Myotonia Scale – Severity Global Score \n\n  \n\nNumber of subjects 25 25 \n\nMean (SD) value at Baseline 53.8 (10.0) \n\nMean (SD) value at Day 18 24.0 (17.1) 47.6 (23.3) \n\nMean (SD) absolute change from baseline -29.8 (16.0) -6.2 (19.0) \n\nEffect of treatment (linear mixed model) p < 0.001 \n\nSecondary Analysis \n\nClinical Myotonia Scale – Disability Global Score \n\n  \n\nNumber of subjects 25 25 \n\nMean (SD) value at Baseline 7.8 (2.8) \n\nMean (SD) value at Day 18 2.7 (2.6) 7.0 (3.8) \n\nMean (SD) absolute change from baseline -5.1 (3.1) -0.8 (3.4) \n\nEffect of treatment (linear mixed model) p < 0.001 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nNamuscla in all subsets of the paediatric population in the symptomatic treatment of myotonic \n\ndisorders (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nMexiletine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration with a \n\nbioavailability of about 90% in healthy subjects. Peak plasma concentrations following oral \n\nadministration occur within 2 to 3 hours. No notable accumulation of mexiletine was observed after \n\nrepeated administration.  \n\nFood does not affect the rate or extent of absorption of mexiletine. Therefore, mexiletine can be taken \n\nwith or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nMexiletine is rapidly distributed in the body; its volume of distribution is large and varies from 5 to 9 \n\nL/kg in healthy individuals.  \n\nMexiletine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (55%).  \n\nMexiletine crosses the placental barrier and diffuses into breast milk. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nMexiletine is mainly (90%) metabolized in the liver, the primary pathway being CYP2D6 metabolism, \n\nalthough it is also a substrate for CYP1A2. The metabolic degradation proceeds via various pathways, \n\nincluding aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation, dealkylation, deamination and N-oxidation. Several of \n\nthe resulting metabolites are submitted to further conjugation with glucuronic acid (phase II \n\nmetabolism); among these are the major metabolites p-hydroxymexiletine, hydroxy-methylmexiletine \n\nand N-hydroxymexiletine. \n\nThe influence of CYP2D6 phenotype on mexiletine metabolism has been extensively investigated. \n\nMexiletine pharmacokinetics are characterised by significantly lower total and renal clearance \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n11 \n\nresulting in prolonged elimination half-life, higher exposure, and lower volume of distribution in poor \n\nmetabolisers compared to extensive metabolisers. \n\n \n\nApproximately 10% is excreted unchanged by the kidney. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nMexiletine is eliminated slowly in humans (with a mean elimination half-life of 10 hours, ranging \n\nfrom 5 to 15 hours). \n\nExcretion of mexiletine essentially occurs through the kidney (90% of the dose, including 10% as \n\nunchanged mexiletine).  \n\n \n\nMexiletine excretion may increase when the urinary pH is acidic, compared to normal or alkaline pH. \n\nIn a clinical study, 51% of the mexiletine dose was excreted via the kidney at a urinary pH of 5, \n\ncompared to 10% at normal pH. Changes in urinary pH are not expected to affect efficacy or safety. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nA linear relationship between mexiletine dose and plasma concentration has been observed in the dose \n\nrange of 83 to 500 mg. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nCYP2D6 polymorphism \n\nCYP2D6 polymorphism affects mexiletine pharmacokinetics. Individuals who are CYP2D6 poor \n\nmetabolisers (PM) exhibit higher mexiletine concentrations than CYP2D6 intermediate (IM), \n\nextensive (i.e. normal) or ultra-rapid (UM) metabolisers. The proportions of different ethnic \n\npopulations across these various classes are tabulated below. \n\n \n\nEthnicity Poor metabolisers  \n\n(PM) \n\nIntermediate \n\nmetabolisers (IM) \n\nUltra-rapid \n\nmetabolisers(UM) \n\nCaucasians Up to 10% 1-2% Up to 10% \n\nAfricans Up to 10% - Up to 5% \n\nAsians Up to 5% More than 50% Up to 2% \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nIn population pharmacokinetic analyses, weight was found to influence mexiletine pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAge \n\nThere is no clinically relevant effect of age on the exposure of mexiletine in adults.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. The main observed effects in rats \n\nand/or dogs were vomiting, diarrhoea, tremor, ataxia, convulsions and tachycardia. However, these \n\nstudies were not performed in accordance with contemporary standards and are, hence, of unclear \n\nclinical relevance.  \n\nThe studies in rats on carcinogenic potential were negative, but not performed in accordance with \n\ncurrent standards and therefore of unclear clinical relevance. The negative genotoxicity potential does \n\nnot indicate an increased carcinogenic risk of treatment with mexiletine. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Namuscla is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nNamuscla is a medicine that contains the active substance mexiletine. \n\n \n\nNamuscla is used to treat the symptoms of myotonia (when muscles relax slowly and with difficulty \n\nafter they are used) in adults with non-dystrophic myotonic disorders, which are caused by genetic \n\ndefects that affect muscle function.  \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Namuscla  \n\n \n\nDo not take Namuscla \n\n- if you are allergic to mexiletine or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\n- if you are allergic to any local anaesthetic \n\n-  if you have had heart attack  \n\n- if your heart does not work well enough \n\n- if you have certain disorders of the heart rhythm \n\n- if your heart beats too fast \n\n- if the blood vessels of your heart are damaged \n\n- if you also take certain medicines to treat disorders of the heart rhythm (see Other medicines \n\nand Namuscla) \n\n- if you also take certain medicines which have a narrow therapeutic window (see Other \n\nmedicines and Namuscla). \n\n \n\nIf you have any doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before taking Namuscla if you have: \n\n- heart problems  \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n24 \n\n- liver problems \n\n- kidney problems \n\n- low or high potassium blood levels \n\n-  low magnesium blood levels \n\n-  epilepsy  \n\n \n\nHeart function \n\nBefore starting treatment with Namuscla, you will have tests to check how well your heart is working, \n\nincluding ECG (Electrocardiogram). These tests will also be performed regularly during treatment \n\nwith Namuscla, and before and after your dose of Namuscla is modified. How often these tests will be \n\nperformed depends on your heart function.  \n\nIf you or your doctor detects any heart rhythm disturbances or any of the conditions stated in section \n\n“Do not take Namuscla”, your doctor will stop your treatment with Namuscla. \n\n \n\nIf you notice that the rhythm of your heart changes (the heart beats faster or slower), if you feel \n\nfluttering or pain in your chest, if you have difficulty breathing, if you feel dizzy, if you sweat or if \n\nyou faint, you have to contact an emergency centre immediately. \n\n \n\nSome patients may have higher blood levels of Namuscla because of slower break down in the liver \n\nand the dose may need to be adjusted accordingly. \n\n  \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nNamuscla should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years old. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Namuscla \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines.  \n\n \n\nDo not take Namuscla with certain medicines for treating heart rhythm disorders (quinidine, \n\nprocainamide, disopyramide, ajmaline, encainide, flecainide, propafenone, moricizine, amiodarone, \n\nsotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, dronedarone, vernakalant). See section “Do not take Namuscla”. Taking \n\nNamuscla together with any of these medicines increases the risk of a serious heart rhythm disturbance \n\ncalled torsades de pointes. \n\n \n\nDo not take Namuscla with certain medicines which have a so called narrow therapeutic window \n\n(these are medicines where small differences in dose or blood concentration may impact the effect of \n\nthe medicine or side effects). Examples of such medicines are digoxin (for heart problems), lithium \n\n(mood stabiliser), phenytoin (for treating epilepsy), theophylline (against asthma) and warfarin \n\n(against blood clots).  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following since these medicines may affect \n\nor be affected by Namuscla:  \n\n• medicines for heart problems (lidocaine, tocainide, propranolol, esmolol, metoprolol, atenolol, \ncarvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol, verapamil, diltiazem),  \n\n• certain other medicines:  \no timolol for treating high pressure in the eye (glaucoma),  \n\n \n\no certain antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, rifampicin),  \no certain antidepressants (fluvoxamine),  \no tizanidine (used to relax the muscles),  \no metformin (used against diabetes) \no omeprazole (to treat stomach ulcer and gastric acid reflux).  \n\n \n\nSmoking and Namuscla \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you start to smoke or quit smoking while taking Namuscla because \n\nsmoking impacts the Namuscla blood levels and your dose may need to be adjusted accordingly. \n\n \n\n\n\nInternal Doc Ref: v6.6 \n\n25 \n\nNamuscla with drink \n\nIt is recommended to reduce your caffeine intake by half while on treatment with mexiletine because \n\nthe medicine can increase caffeine levels in your blood. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. If you become pregnant while taking Namuscla, \n\nsee your doctor immediately as it is preferable not to take Namuscla while you are pregnant. If you \n\nbecome pregnant while taking Namuscla, see your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nMexiletine passes into human milk. You should talk to your doctor about this, together you will make \n\na decision whether to abstain breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from mexiletine therapy. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nNamuscla may in rare cases cause tiredness, confusion, blurred vision: If you have these effects do not \n\ndrive, cycle and use machines.  \n\n \n\n3. How to take Namuscla \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 1 capsule per day.

The maintenance dose is 1 to 3 capsules daily taken \n\nat regular intervals throughout the day. \n\n \n\nDo not take more than 3 capsules a day. \n\n \n\nCheck of heart function \n\nBefore starting treatment with Namuscla and regularly during treatment, you will have tests to check \n\nhow well your heart is working,. Depending on your heart function you may also need testing before \n\nand after any dose adjustment. See section “Warnings and precautions”. Your doctor will also \n\nregularly reassess your treatment to make sure Namuscla is still the best medicine for you. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nNamuscla is for oral use. \n\n \n\nSwallow the capsule with a glass of water, while standing or sitting up. You may take Namuscla \n\nduring a meal to avoid belly pain (see section “Possible side effects”). \n\n \n\nIf you take more Namuscla than you should \n\nContact your doctor if you take more than the recommended dose of Namuscla. This could be very \n\nharmful to your health.
