NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \nFeraccru 30 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\nEach capsule contains 30 mg iron  (as ferric maltol). \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \n\nEach capsule contains 91.5 mg of lactose, 0.5 mg of Allura Red AC (E129) and 0.3 mg Sunset Yellow \nFCF (E110). \n\n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \nCapsules, hard. \n\n \nRed capsule (19 mm long x 7 mm diameter). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \nFeraccru is indicated in adults for the treatment of iron deficiency. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose is one capsule twice daily, morning and evening, on an empty stomach (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \nTreatment duration will depend on the severity of iron deficiency but generally at least 12-weeks \n\ntreatment is required. The treatment should be continued as long as necessary to replenish the body \n\niron stores according to blood tests. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Feraccru in children (17 years and under) has not yet been established. No \n\ndata are available (see section 4.4). \n\n \nThe elderly and patients with Hepatic or renal impairment \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients or patients with renal impairment (eGFR ≥15 \nml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n \n\nNo clinical data on the need to adjust the dosage in patients with impaired hepatic function and/or \n\nrenal impairment (eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2) are  available (see section 4.4). \n\n \nMethod of administration \n\n \nOral use. \n\n \nFeraccru capsules should be taken whole on an empty stomach (with half a glass of water), as the \n\nabsorption of iron is reduced when Feraccru is taken with food (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n• Haemochromatosis and other iron overload syndromes. \n\n• Patients receiving repeated blood transfusions. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \nFeraccru should not be used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare or in IBD- \n\npatients with haemoglobin (Hb) <9.5 g/dl. \n\n \nIron preparations in excess may cause toxicity especially among children. Feraccru must not be \n\nadministrated to children (see section 4.2). \n\nSpecial care should be taken if other dietary and/or iron salt supplementation are used concurrently. \n\nIron deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) diagnosis should be made based on blood tests; it is \nimportant to investigate the cause of the iron deficiency and to exclude underlying causes of anaemia \nother than iron deficiency. \n\n \nFeraccru has not been studied in patients with impaired renal (eGFR<15 ml/min/1.73 m2) and/or \n\nimpaired hepatic function \n\n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \n\nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \nThis medicinal product also contains Allura Red AC (E129) and Sunset Yellow FCF (E110): these \n\nmay cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nNo drug interaction studies have been performed with Feraccru. Based on an in vitro study maltol is \n\nglucuronised through UGT1A6 (see section 5.2). \n\n \nFood has been shown to inhibit uptake of Feraccru: Feraccru should be taken on an empty stomach \n\n(see section 4.2) \n\n \nIntravenous administration of iron salts \n\nConcomitant administration of Feraccru and intravenous iron should be avoided as the combination \n\nmay induce hypotension or even collapse due to the fast release of iron resulting from saturation of \n\ntransferrin caused by intravenous iron. \n\n \nImpact of Feraccru on absorption of other medicinal products \n\nOral iron is known to reduce the absorption of penicillamine, bisphosphonates, ciprofloxacin, \n\nentacapone, levodopa, levofloxacin, levothyroxine (thyroxine) moxifloxacin, mycophenolate, \nnorfloxacin and ofloxacin. These medicinal products should be given at least 2 hours apart from \nFeraccru. \n\n \nAbsorption of both iron and antibiotic may be reduced if oral iron is given with tetracycline. \n\nAdministration of iron preparations and tetracyclines should be separated by 2 to 3 hours. \n\n \nMedicinal products that may impact absorption and distribution of iron from Feraccru Absorption of \n\noral iron may be reduced by calcium and magnesium salts (such as magnesium trisilicate). \n\nAdministration of iron preparations with such compounds should be separated by at least 2 hours. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\nConcomitant use of iron with dimercaprol should be avoided as the combination of dimercaprol and \n\niron is nephrotoxic. \n\n \nConcomitant use of chloramphenicol with iron should be avoided as chloramphenicol delays plasma \n\niron clearance, incorporation of iron into red blood cells and interferes with erythropoiesis. \n\n \nConcomitant use of iron with methyldopa should be avoided as oral iron may antagonise the \n\nhypotensive effect of methyldopa. \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of Feraccru in pregnant women. Ferric maltol is not systemically \n\navailable. \n\n \nDefinitive animal studies are not available for maltol with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a \n\nprecautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Feraccru during pregnancy. \n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nFerric maltol is not available systemically and is therefore unlikely to pass into the mother's milk. No \n\nclinical studies are available to date. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \n\nFeraccru during breast-feeding. \n\n \nFertility \n\nThere are no data on the effect of ferric maltol on human fertility. Ferric maltol is not systemically \n\navailable. Fertility was unaffected following maltol treatment in animal studies. However, the \n\nconducted reproductive toxicity studies are insufficient to discard any risk in humans. \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nNo effect is expected from an oral iron product. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain [8%], \n\nflatulence [4%], constipation [4%], abdominal discomfort [2%]/distension [2%] and diarrhoea [3%]) \n\nand these were mainly mild to moderate in severity. Reported severe adverse reactions were \n\nabdominal pain [4%], constipation [0.9%] and diarrhoea [0.9%]. \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring clinical studies to date with Feraccru. \n\n \nAdverse reaction frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100, <1/10), \n\nuncommon (≥1/1,000, <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10000). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies to date. \n\n \nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS COMMON \n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\nUNCOMMON \n\n(≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100) \n\nNervous system disorders  Headache \nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain (including \n\nupper abdomen) \n\nFlatulence \n\nConstipation \n\nAbdominal discomfort/ \n\ndistension \n\nDiarrhoea \n\nDiscoloured faeces \n\nNausea \n\nSmall intestinal bacterial \novergrowth \n\nVomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n Acne \n\nErythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders \n Joint stiffness \n\nPain in extremity \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n Thirst \n\nInvestigations  Blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased \n\nBlood thyroid stimulating \nhormone increased \n\nGamma-glutamyltransferase \n\nincreased \n \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions: \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nIron overdosage is dangerous and can be life-threatening in young children, requiring immediate \n\nattention. \n\n \nSymptoms of iron overdose \n\nEarly signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The vomit and \n\nstools may be grey or black. In mild cases early features improve but in more serious cases there may \n\nbe evidence of hypoperfusion (cool peripheries and hypotension), metabolic acidosis and systemic \n\ntoxicity.  In serious cases there can be recurrence of vomiting and gastrointestinal bleeding, 12 hours \n\nafter ingestion.  Shock can result from hypovolaemia or direct cardiotoxicity. Evidence of \n\nhepatocellular necrosis appears at this stage with jaundice, bleeding, hypoglycaemia, encephalopathy \nand positive anion gap metabolic acidosis. Poor tissue perfusion may lead to renal failure. Rarely, \n\ngastric scarring causing stricture or pyloric stenosis (alone or in combination) may lead to partial or \n\ncomplete bowel obstruction 2-5 weeks after ingestion. \n\n \nIngestion of 20 mg/kg elemental iron is potentially toxic and 200-250 mg/kg is potentially fatal. No \n\nsingle method of assessment is entirely satisfactory - clinical features as well as laboratory analysis \n\nmust be taken into account. Serum iron levels measured at about 4 hours after ingestion is the best \n\nlaboratory measure of severity. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nSupportive and symptomatic measures reflecting best standard medical care should be implemented. \n\nThe use of desferroxamine should be considered: for detailed information see product information \n\nprovided by the manufacturer. Haemodialysis does not remove iron effectively but should be \n\nconsidered on a supportive basis for acute renal failure as this will facilitate removal of the iron- \n\ndesferroxamine complex. \n \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Iron trivalent, oral preparation, ATC code: B03AB10. \n\n \nMechanism of action \n\nFeraccru contains iron in a stable ferric state as a complex with a trimaltol ligand. The complex is \n\ndesigned to provide, in a controlled way, utilisable iron for uptake across the intestinal wall and \n\ntransfer to the iron transport and storage proteins in the body (transferrin and ferritin, respectively). \n\nThe complex dissociates on uptake from the gastro-intestinal tract and the complex itself does not \n\nenter the systemic circulation. \n\n \nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nIBD Studies \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Feraccru for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia was studied in 128 \n\npatients (age range 18-76 years; 45 males and 83 females) with inactive to mildly active IBD (58 \n\npatients with Ulcerative Colitis [UC] and 70 patients with Crohn’s disease [CD]) and baseline Hb \n\nconcentrations between 9.5 g/dL and 12 / 13 g/dL for females / males. Patients were enrolled in one \n\ncombined randomised, placebo-controlled clinical study (AEGIS 1/2).  69 % of the patients with UC \n\nhad a SCCAI score ≤2 and 31 % a SCCAI score of 3. 83 % of the patients with CD had a CDAI-score \n\n<150 and 17 % a CDAI-score >150-220. All patients had discontinued from prior oral ferrous product \n\n(OFP) treatment:  more than 60 % of the subjects stopped taking prior OFP due to adverse events. The \n\nmedian time since last dose of OFP was 22 months in the experimental group and 17 months in the \n\nplacebo arm. 52 % of the patients in AEGIS 1 and 33 % in AEGIS 2 had a disease flare in the previous \n\n6 months. The median (min-max) time since last disease flare was around 7 months (0.0-450 months). \n\nSubjects were randomised to receive either 30 mg Feraccru twice daily or a matched placebo control \nfor 12 weeks. The difference between the change from baseline for Feraccru compared to placebo at \n\nweek 12 was 2.25 g/dL (p<0.0001). Following completion of the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of \n\nthe studies, all subjects were switched to Feraccru 30 mg twice daily open-label treatment for a further \n\n52 weeks. \n\n \nThe results for the other key efficacy endpoints are shown in Table 2. \n\n \nTable 2: Summary of Other Key Efficacy Endpoints (AEGIS 1/2) \n\n \nEndpoint Hb change \n\n(g/dL) from \n\nBaseline* at \n\nWeek 4 \nMean (SE) \n\nHb change \n\n(g/dL) from \n\nBaseline* at \n\nWeek 8 \nMean(SE) \n\nProportion of \n\nsubjects that \n\nachieved \n\nnormalised \n\nHb at Week \n\n12 (%) \n\nProportion of \n\nsubjects that \n\nachieved \n\n≥1 g/dL change \n\nin Hb at Week \n12 (%) \n\nProportion of \n\nsubjects that \n\nachieved \n\n≥2 g/dL change \n\nin Hb at Week \n12 (%) \n\nFeraccru (N=64) 1.06 (0.08)*** 1.79 (0.11)*** 66 78 56 \n\nPlacebo (N=64) 0.02 (0.08) 0.06 (0.11) 12 11 0 \n* Hb at Baseline mean (SE): Feraccru 11.0 (1.027) g/dL, Placebo 11.1 (0.851) g/dL; ***p<0.0001 compared to \n\nplacebo group; \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nAn increase of ≥1 g/dL change in Hb at Week 12 was achieved in 90 % and 69 % of the ulcerative \n\ncolitis (N=29) and Crohn’s Disease (N=35) subgroups, respectively. An increase of ≥2 g/dL change in \n\nHb at Week 12 was achieved in 62 % and 51 % of the ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s Disease \n\nsubgroups, respectively. Iron deficiency was also shown to be corrected by increase in ferritin levels in \n\nboth studies.  Mean ferritin (μg/L) levels in subjects taking feraccru improved steadily from baseline \n\n(mean 8.6 μg/L [SD 6.77]) to Week 12 (mean 26.0 μg/L [SD 30.57]), a mean overall improvement of \n\n17.4 μg/L. Ferritin continued to rise over long-term treatment with Feraccru (mean 68.9 μg/L [SD \n\n96.24] at 64 weeks, a mean overall improvement of 60.3 μg/L). \n\n \n\nChronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Study \n\n \n\nThe efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Feraccru for the treatment of iron \n\ndeficiency anaemia in adult subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was studied in a phase III \n\nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical study (AEGIS-CKD). 167 patients (age range 30-90 years; 50 \n\nmales and 117 females) with an eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73m2 and <60 mL/min/1.73m2 and baseline \n\nHb 8.0 g/dL and <11.0 g/dL and ferritin <250 ng/mL with a transferrin saturation (TSAT) <25%, or \n\nferritin <500 ng/mL with a TSAT of <15% were randomized 2:1 to receive either Feraccru 30 mg \n\ncapsules twice daily or placebo twice daily for a treatment period of 16 weeks. This was followed by an \n\nopen-label treatment phase, which included up to 36 weeks of treatment with Feraccru only. \n\n \n\nFeraccru resulted in clinically and statistically significant increases in Hb compared to placebo during \n\nthe double-blind 16-week treatment period. The least squares mean (LSM) change in Hb concentration \n\nfrom baseline to Week 16 was 0.50 g/dL for the ferric maltol group and -0.02 g/dL for the placebo \n\ngroup, with a statistically significant LSM difference of 0.52 (p=0.0149).  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nThe LSM change in ferritin concentration from baseline to Week 16 with LOCF was 25.42 µg/L for \n\nthe Feraccru group and -7.23 µg/L for the placebo group, with a statistically significant  LSM \n\ndifference of 32.65 (p=0.0007). \n\n Paediatric Studies \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nFeraccru in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in iron deficient anaemia (see section 4.2 \n\nfor information on paediatric use). \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nAbsorption and elimination \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Feraccru was assessed through measurement of plasma and urine \n\nconcentrations of maltol and maltol glucuronide, together with serum iron parameters after a single \n\ndose and at steady state (after 1 week) in 24 subjects with iron deficiency, randomised to receive \n\n30 mg, 60 mg or 90 mg Feraccru twice daily. Blood and urine samples were assayed for maltol and \n\nmaltol glucuronide.  Serum samples were assayed for iron parameters. \n \n\nMaltol was transiently measured in plasma with a AUC0-t between 0.022 and 0.205 h.µg/mL across all \n\ndosing regimens and both study days. Non-clinical studies have shown that maltol is metabolised \n\nthrough UGT1A6 and by sulphation. It is not known if medical products that inhibit UGT enzymes \n\nhave the potential to increase maltol concentration (see section 4.5). The maltol appeared to be rapidly \n\nmetabolised to maltol glucuronide (AUC0-t between 9.83 and 30.9 h.µg/mL across all dosage \n\nregimens). Maximum maltol and maltol glucuronide concentrations were reached 1 to 1.5 hours after \n\noral administration of Feraccru. Exposure to maltol glucuronide increased dose proportionally over the \n\nFeraccru 30 to 90 mg twice daily dosing range and there was no significant accumulation of either \n\nafter 7 days treatment with Feraccru. Of the total maltol ingested, a mean of between 39.8 % and \n\n60.0 % was excreted as maltol glucuronide. Peak transferrin saturation (TSAT) and total serum iron \n\nvalues were reached 1.5 to 3 hours after oral administration of Feraccru. Total serum iron \n\nconcentrations and TSAT values were generally higher with increasing Feraccru doses. TSAT and \ntotal serum iron profiles were comparable between Day 1 and Day 8. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Feraccru were also investigated at steady state in 15 subjects who \n\nwere already participating in the AEGIS1/2 study described above and who had been in the open-label \n\ntreatment phase for at least 7 days (Feraccru 30 mg twice daily). Maltol was again transiently \n\nmeasured in plasma with a half-life of 0.7 hours, with a Cmax of 67.3 + 28.3 ng/mL. The maltol \n\nappeared to be rapidly metabolised to maltol glucuronide (Cmax = 4677 + 1613 ng/mL). Maximum \nmaltol and maltol glucuronide concentrations were reached approximately 1 hour after oral \n\nadministration of Feraccru. Maximum total iron serum concentrations were measured 1-2 hours after \n\nadministration. The pharmacokinetic profiles of maltol/maltol glucuronide and iron parameters were \n\nindependent of one another. \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \nFerric maltol \n\nNon-clinical studies revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity and local \n\ntolerance studies conducted with ferric maltol. \n\n \nDeposition of iron in the reticulo-endothelial system, liver and spleen was recorded in dogs \n\nadminstered 250 mg/kg/day ferric maltol. \n\n \nNo reproductive and developmental toxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with \n\nferric maltol. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nMaltol \n\nHaemosiderin was observed in Kupffer cells of dogs administered 250 mg/kg/day maltol. At doses of \n\n500 mg/kg/day testicular degeneration and toxic signs indicative of iron chelation were recorded. \n\nThese effects were not observable in a second study in dogs receiving up to 300 mg/kg/day. \n\n \nA possible potential genotoxic potential for maltol could not be fully ruled out. However, no \n\ncarcinogenic effects were recorded in studies conducted in mice and rats receiving up to \n\n400 mg/kg/day maltol. \n \n\n \n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \nFeraccru 30 mg hard capsules \n\nIron (as ferric maltol) \n \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n• This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it onto others. It may harm them, even if their \n\nsigns of illness are the same as yours. \n\n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n1. What Feraccru is and what it is used for. \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Feraccru. \n\n3. How to take Feraccru. \n\n4. Possible side effects. \n\n5. How to store Feraccru. \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information. \n \n \n\n1. What Feraccru is and what it is used for \n\n \nFeraccru contains iron (as ferric maltol). Feraccru is used in adults to treat low iron stores in your body. \n\nLow iron causes anaemia (too few red blood cells). \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you take Feraccru \n\n \nDo not take Feraccru: \n- If you are allergic to ferric maltol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- If you have any illness causing iron overload or a disturbance in how your body uses iron. \n\n- If you have received multiple blood transfusions. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n\nBefore starting treatment, your doctor will use a blood test to make sure that your anaemia is not severe or \n\ncaused by anything other than iron deficiency (low iron stores). \n\n \nYou should avoid taking Feraccru if you are experiencing a “flare” of your IBD. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not give Feraccru to children or adolescents 17 years and under as it has not been studied in this age \n\ngroup. Too much iron is dangerous in young children and can be life-threatening. \n\n \nOther medicines and Feraccru \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines. \n\n \nYou should leave at least 2 hours between taking Feraccru and taking: \n\n• Supplements or medicines that contain magnesium or calcium. \n\n• Some antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. \n\n• Bisphosphonates (used to treat bone diseases). \n\n• Penicillamine (used to bind metals). \n\n• Some medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease (entacapone, levodopa) and thyroid problems \n\n(levothyroxine). \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n• Mycophenolate (used with other medicines to prevent the body rejecting transplanted organs). \n\nYou should not be given iron by injection or infusion (intravenously) while you are taking Feraccru. \n\nYou should not take Feraccru if you are taking dimercaprol (a medicine used to remove toxic metals from \n\nthe blood), chloramphenicol (used to treat bacterial infections), or methyldopa (used to treat high blood \n\npressure). \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou should preferably not take Feraccru if you are pregnant or if you are breast-feeding your baby. \n\n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nor pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nFeraccru is unlikely to have any effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \nFeraccru capsules contain lactose, Sunset Yellow FCF (E110) and Allura Red AC (E129). \n\nLactose: if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your \n\ndoctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \nSunset Yellow (E110) and Allura Red (E129): may cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n3. How to take Feraccru \n\n \nAlways take these capsules exactly as your doctor has told you. \n\n \nAdults (18 years and over in age) \n\nTake Feraccru on an empty stomach with half a glass of water (one hour before a meal, or at least 2 hours \n\nafter a meal). The recommended dose is one capsule (30 mg) taken twice a day, morning and evening. \n\n \nSwallow the capsules whole. \n\n \nIf you take more Feraccru than you should \n\nTaking too much Feraccru can make the person feel sick or be sick and cause bellyache and diarrhoea.  Call \n\nyour doctor or hospital straightaway if you or another person has taken too much Feraccru. Make sure that \nyou take this leaflet and any remaining capsules with you to show to the doctor. \n\n \nIf you forget to take your Feraccru \n\nSkip the missed dose and take the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \n\ncapsule. \n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n4. Possible side effects \n\n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nThe most common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) of Feraccru are: \n\n• Stomach pain \n\n• Flatulence (wind) \n\n• Constipation \n\n• Discomfort or bloating in the stomach \n\n• Diarrhoea \n\n• Nausea (feeling sick) \n\n     Discoloured faeces \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) are: thirst, stiff joints, pain in fingers/toes, \n\nheadache, acne, skin redness, vomiting and increase in bacteria in the small intestine. Blood tests may show \n\nincreased levels of proteins that break down chemicals in the blood and of a hormone that stimulates the \n\nthyroid gland. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \n\nAppendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n\n5. How to store Feraccru \n\n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after EXP: The expiry date refers \n\nto the last day of that month. \n\n \nDo not use this medicine for more than 45 days after first opening the bottle. \n\nDo not store the capsules above 25°C. \n\n6.
