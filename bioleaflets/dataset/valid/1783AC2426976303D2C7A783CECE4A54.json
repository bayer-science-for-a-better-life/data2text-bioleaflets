NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVitekta 85 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 85 mg of elvitegravir. \n \nExcipient with known effect: Each tablet contains 6.2 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nGreen, pentagon-shaped, film-coated tablet of dimensions 8.9 mm x 8.7 mm, debossed with \u201cGSI\u201d on \none side of the tablet and \u201c85\u201d on the other side of the tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVitekta co-administered with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and with other antiretroviral \nagents, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults \nwho are infected with HIV-1 without known mutations associated with resistance to elvitegravir (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \nVitekta must be administered in combination with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor. \n \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics for the co-administered ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor \nshould be consulted. \n \nThe recommended dose of Vitekta is one 85 mg tablet or one 150 mg tablet taken orally once daily \nwith food.  The choice of dose of Vitekta depends on the co-administered protease inhibitor (see \nTable 1 and sections 4.4 and 4.5).  For use of the 150 mg tablet, please refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for Vitekta 150 mg tablets. \n \nVitekta should be administered once daily as follows: \n- Either at the same time as a once daily ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor \n- Or with the first dose of a twice daily ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1: Recommended dosing regimens \n \nDose of Vitekta Dose of co-administered ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor \n\n85 mg once daily \natazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg once daily \n\nlopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily \n\n150 mg once daily \ndarunavir 600 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily \n\nfosamprenavir 700 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily \n\n \nThere are no data to recommend the use of Vitekta with dosing frequencies or HIV-1 protease \ninhibitors other than those presented in Table 1. \n \nMissed dose \nIf the patient misses a dose of Vitekta within 18 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Vitekta with food as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient misses \na dose of Vitekta by more than 18 hours, and it is almost time for their next dose, the patient should \nnot take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Vitekta another tablet should be taken. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n(see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Vitekta is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Vitekta is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B).  Elvitegravir has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of elvitegravir in children aged 0 to less than 18 years have not yet been \nestablished (see section 5.1).  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nVitekta should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated tablet should \nnot be chewed or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with the following medicinal products due to the potential for loss of virologic \nresponse and possible development of resistance (see section 4.5): \n\u2022 anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \n\u2022 antimycobacterials: rifampicin \n\u2022 herbal products: St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nThe use of Vitekta with HIV-1 protease inhibitors or dosing frequencies other than those presented in \nTable 1 may result in inadequate or elevated plasma levels of elvitegravir and/or the co-administered \nmedicinal products. \n \nResistance \nElvitegravir-resistant viruses show cross-resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir \nin most cases (see section 5.1). \n \nElvitegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance.  Therefore, whenever possible, Vitekta \nshould be administered with a fully active ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and a second fully \nactive antiretroviral agent to minimise the potential for virologic failure and the development of \nresistance (see section 5.1). \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \nElvitegravir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A.  Co-administration of Vitekta with strong CYP3A \ninducers (including St. John\u2019s wort [Hypericum perforatum], rifampicin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital and phenytoin) is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).  Co-administration of \nVitekta with moderate CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to, efavirenz and bosentan) is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \nDue to the need for co-administration of Vitekta with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, \nprescribers should consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered protease \ninhibitor and ritonavir for a description of contraindicated medicinal products and other significant \ndrug-drug interactions that may cause potentially life-threatening adverse reactions or loss of \ntherapeutic effect and possible development of resistance. \n \nAtazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir have been shown to significantly increase the plasma \nconcentrations of elvitegravir (see section 4.5).  When used in combination with atazanavir/ritonavir \nand lopinavir/ritonavir, the dose of Vitekta should be decreased from 150 mg once daily to 85 mg once \ndaily (see section 4.2). \n \nCo-administration of Vitekta and related active substances: Vitekta must be used in combination with \na ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor.  Vitekta should not be used with a protease inhibitor boosted by \nanother agent as dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established.  Boosting \nelvitegravir with an agent other than ritonavir may result in suboptimal plasma concentrations of \nelvitegravir and/or the protease inhibitor leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development \nof resistance. \n \nVitekta should not be used in combination with products containing elvitegravir or pharmacokinetic \nboosting agents other than ritonavir. \n \nContraception requirements \nFemale patients of childbearing potential should use either a hormonal contraceptive containing at \nleast 30 \u00b5g ethinylestradiol and containing norgestimate as the progestagen or should use an \nalternative reliable method of contraception (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).  Co-administration of \nelvitegravir with oral contraceptives containing progestagens other than norgestimate have not been \nstudied and, therefore, should be avoided. \n \nPatients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of \noestrogen deficiency (see section 4.5). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nOpportunistic infections \nPatients receiving Vitekta or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic \ninfections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical \nobservation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \nPatients with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus co-infection \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nPhysicians should refer to current HIV treatment guidelines for the optimal management of \nHIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). \n \nLiver disease \nElvitegravir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  No \ndose adjustment of Vitekta is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class B) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have also been reported to occur in the setting of \nimmune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nExcipients \nVitekta contains lactose.  Consequently, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nInteractions with CYP3A inducers \nElvitegravir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A (see section 5.2).  Medicinal products that are strong \n(causing a > 5-fold increase in substrate clearance) or moderate (causing a 2-5 fold increase in \nsubstrate clearance) inducers of CYP3A are expected to decrease plasma concentrations of \nelvitegravir. \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated \nCo-administration of Vitekta with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A is \ncontraindicated as the expected decrease in plasma concentrations of elvitegravir can lead to loss of \ntherapeutic effect and possible development of resistance to elvitegravir (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nCo-administration of Vitekta with medicinal products that are moderate inducers of CYP3A \n(including, but not limited to, efavirenz and bosentan) is not recommended as the expected decrease in \nplasma concentrations of elvitegravir can lead to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development \nof resistance to elvitegravir (see section 4.4). \n \nInteractions requiring dose adjustment of Vitekta \nElvitegravir undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP3A (major route), and glucuronidation by \nUGT1A1/3 enzymes (minor route).  Co-administration of Vitekta with medicinal products that are \npotent inhibitors of UGT1A1/3 may result in increased elvitegravir plasma concentrations and dose \nmodifications may be required.  For example, atazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir (potent \nUGT1A1/3 inhibitors) have been shown to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of \nelvitegravir (see Table 2).  Accordingly, when used in combination with atazanavir/ritonavir and \nlopinavir/ritonavir, the dose of Vitekta should be decreased from 150 mg once daily to 85 mg once \ndaily (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nOther interactions \nElvitegravir is a modest inducer and may have the potential to induce CYP2C9 and/or inducible UGT \nenzymes.  As such, elvitegravir may decrease the plasma concentration of substrates of CYP2C9 (such \nas warfarin) or UGT (such as ethinyl estradiol).  In addition, in vitro studies have shown that \nelvitegravir is a weak to modest inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A enzymes.  Elvitegravir \nwould also have potential to be a weak to modest inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 enzymes, as these \nenzymes are regulated in a similar manner to CYP2C9 and CYP3A.  However, clinical data have \nshown there are no clinically relevant changes in the exposure of methadone (which is primarily \nmetabolised by CYP2B6 and CYP2C19) following co-administration with boosted elvitegravir versus \nadministration of methadone alone (see Table 2). \n \nElvitegravir is a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and an inhibitor of OATP1B3 in vitro.  The \nin vivo relevance of these interactions is not clear. \n \nInteractions between elvitegravir and potential co-administered medicinal products are listed in \nTable 2 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d).  These interactions \nare based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of \ninteraction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of therapeutic effect. \n \nWhere interactions were studied, the effect on Vitekta was determined by comparing the \npharmacokinetics of boosted elvitegravir (using either ritonavir or cobicistat as a pharmacokinetic \nenhancer) in the absence and presence of the co-administered medicinal product.  No interactions were \nstudied using unboosted elvitegravir.  Except where indicated in Table 2, the dose of boosted \nelvitegravir or co-administered medicinal product was the same when administered alone or in \ncombination.  The pharmacokinetic parameters of the protease inhibitors presented in Table 2 were \nassessed in the presence of ritonavir. \n \nAlthough there may be no actual or predicted interactions between a medicinal product and \nelvitegravir, there may be interactions between a medicinal product and ritonavir and/or the protease \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\ninhibitor co-administered with elvitegravir.

Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of elvitegravir in milk.  A risk to \nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  Therefore, Vitekta should not be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n \nFertility \nNo human data on the effect of elvitegravir on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of elvitegravir on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of elvitegravir on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on data from a controlled clinical study (GS-US-183-0145) \nin which 712 HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults received elvitegravir \n(n = 354) or raltegravir (n = 358) each administered with a background regimen consisting of a fully \nactive ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and other antiretroviral agents.  Of these 712 patients, 543 \n(269 elvitegravir and 274 raltegravir) and 439 (224 elvitegravir and 215 raltegravir) received at least \n48 and 96 weeks of treatment, respectively. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions to elvitegravir were diarrhoea (7.1%) and nausea \n(4.0%) (see Table 3). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions to elvitegravir from clinical study experience are listed in Table 3 below, by body \nsystem organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) or \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nTable 3: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions to elvitegravir based on experience for \n96 weeks from clinical study GS-US-183-0145 \n \nFrequency Adverse reaction \nPsychiatric disorders: \n\nUncommon suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness), depression, insomnia \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon headache \nUncommon dizziness, paraesthesia, somnolence, dysgeusia \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \nUncommon dyspepsia, abdominal distension, flatulence \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nCommon rash \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon fatigue \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is \nmore variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nDiarrhoea \nIn study GS-US-183-0145, diarrhoea was reported as an adverse reaction in 7.1% of subjects in the \nelvitegravir group and in 5.3% of subjects in the raltegravir group.  In these subjects, diarrhoea was \nmild to moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of study drug. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for children below 18 years of age.  Vitekta is not recommended in this \npopulation (see section 4.2). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity.  Treatment of overdose with \nelvitegravir consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as \nobservation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with elvitegravir.  As elvitegravir is highly bound to plasma \nproteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX11. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nElvitegravir is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  Integrase is an HIV-1 encoded \nenzyme that is required for viral replication.  Inhibition of integrase prevents the integration of \nHIV-1 DNA into host genomic DNA, blocking the formation of the HIV-1 provirus and propagation \nof the viral infection.  Elvitegravir does not inhibit human topoisomerases I or II. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \nThe antiviral activity of elvitegravir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cells, monocyte/macrophage cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes and the 50% \neffective concentration (EC50) values were in the range of 0.02 to 1.7 nM.  Elvitegravir displayed \nantiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged \nfrom 0.1 to 1.3 nM) and activity against HIV-2 (EC50 of 0.53 nM).  The in vitro antiviral activity of \nelvitegravir when combined with antiretroviral drugs from the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase \ninhibitor (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor (PI), \nintegrase strand transfer inhibitor, fusion inhibitor, or CCR5 co-receptor antagonist classes showed no \nantagonism. \n \nElvitegravir did not show inhibition of replication of HBV or HCV in vitro. \n \nResistance \nIn cell culture \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir have been selected in cell culture.  \nPhenotypic resistance to elvitegravir was most commonly associated with the primary integrase \nsubstitutions T66I, E92Q and Q148R.  Additional integrase substitutions observed in cell culture \nselection included H51Y, F121Y, S147G, S153Y, E157Q, and R263K. \n \nCross resistance \nElvitegravir-resistant viruses show varying degrees of cross-resistance to the integrase strand transfer \ninhibitor raltegravir depending on the type and number of substitutions.  Viruses expressing the \nT66I/A substitutions maintain susceptibility to raltegravir, while most other patterns of \nelvitegravir-associated substitutions are associated with reduced susceptibility to raltegravir.  With the \nexception of Y143C/R/H, HIV-1 with the primary raltegravir-associated substitutions T66K, \nQ148H/K/R, or N155H in integrase is associated with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir. \n \nIn treatment-experienced patients \nIn an analysis of HIV-1 isolates from treatment-failure subjects in study GS-US-183-0145 through \nweek 96, the development of one or more primary elvitegravir resistance-associated substitutions was \nobserved in 23 of the 86 subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and elvitegravir \ntreatment-failure isolates (23/351 elvitegravir-treated subjects, 6.6%).  Similar rates of raltegravir \nresistance development occurred in the HIV-1 from subjects treated with raltegravir (26/351 \nraltegravir-treated subjects, 7.4%).  The most common substitutions that emerged in HIV-1 isolates \nfrom elvitegravir-treated subjects were T66I/A (n = 8), E92Q/G (n = 7), T97A (n = 4), S147G (n = 4), \nQ148R (n = 4), and N155H (n = 5) in integrase.  In phenotypic analyses of HIV-1 isolates with \nresistance substitutions from elvitegravir-treated subjects, 14/20 (70%) had reduced susceptibility to \nelvitegravir and 12/20 (60%) had reduced susceptibility to raltegravir. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nClinical experience \nIn treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients \nThe efficacy of elvitegravir is primarily based on the analyses through 96 weeks from one randomised, \ndouble-blind, active-controlled study, study GS-US-183-0145, in treatment-experienced, \nHIV-1 infected patients (n = 702). \n \nIn study GS-US-183-0145, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either elvitegravir \n(150 mg or 85 mg) once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, each administered with a background \nregimen (BR) containing a fully-active ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (either atazanavir, \ndarunavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir or tipranavir) and a second agent.  The BR was selected by the \ninvestigator based on genotypic/phenotypic resistance testing and prior antiretroviral treatment history.  \nRandomisation was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level (\u2264 100,000 copies/mL or \n> 100,000 copies/mL) and the class of the second agent (NRTI or other classes).  Virologic response \nrate was evaluated in both treatment arms.  Virologic response was defined as achieving an \nundetectable viral load (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL). \n \nBaseline characteristics and treatment outcomes through 96 weeks for study GS-US-183-0145 are \npresented in Tables 4 and 5 respectively. \n \nTable 4: Demographic and baseline disease characteristics of antiretroviral treatment-\nexperienced HIV-1 infected adult subjects in study GS-US-183-0145 \n \n \n \n\nElvitegravir + background \nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nRaltegravir + background \nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nDemographic characteristics \nMedian age, years (min-max) 44 \n\n(20-78) \n45 \n\n(19-74) \nSex   \n Male 83.2% 80.9% \n Female 16.8% 19.1% \nEthnicity   \n White 60.1% 64.4% \n Black/African American 35.6% 32.2% \n Asian 2.6% 1.4% \n Other 1.7% 2.0% \nBaseline disease characteristics \nMedian baseline plasma \nHIV-1 RNA (range) \nlog10 copies/mL \n\n4.35 \n(1.69-6.63) \n\n4.42 \n(1.69-6.10) \n\nPercentage of subjects with \nviral load > 100,000 copies/mL \n\n25.6 25.6 \n\nMedian baseline CD4+ cell \ncount (range), cells/mm3 \n\n227.0 \n(2.0-1,374.0) \n\n215.0 \n(1.0-1,497.0) \n\nPercentage of subjects with \nCD4+ cell counts \n\u2264 200 cells/mm3 \n\n44.4 \n \n\n44.9 \n\nBaseline genotypic sensitivity \nscorea \n\n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n\n \n \n\n1% \n14% \n81% \n3% \n\n \n \n\n< 1% \n15% \n83% \n2% \n\na Genotypic sensitivity scores are calculated by summing up drug susceptibility values (1 = sensitive; 0 = reduced \nsusceptibility) on all drugs in the baseline background regimen. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 5: Virologic outcome of randomised treatment of study GS-US-183-0145 at week 48 and \nweek 96 (snapshot analysis)a \n \n Week 48 Week 96 \n Elvitegravir \n\n+ background \nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nRaltegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nElvitegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nRaltegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nVirologic success \nHIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL \n\n60% 58% 52% 53% \n\nTreatment difference 2.2% (95% CI = -5.0%, 9.3%) -0.5% (95% CI = -7.9%, 6.8%) \nVirologic failureb 33% 32% 36% 31% \nNo virologic data at \nweek 48 or week 96 \nwindow \n\n7% 11% 12% 16% \n\nDiscontinued study drug \ndue to AE or deathc \n\n2% 5% 3% 7% \n\nDiscontinued study drug \ndue to other reasons and \nlast available \nHIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mLd \n\n4% 5% 8% 9% \n\nMissing data during \nwindow but on study \ndrug \n\n1% 1% 1% 1% \n\na Week 48 window is between day 309 and 364 (inclusive), week 96 window is between day 645 and 700 (inclusive). \nb Includes subjects who had \u2265 50 copies/mL in the week 48 or week 96 window, subjects who discontinued early due to \n\nlack or loss of efficacy, subjects who had a viral load \u2265 50 copies/mL at time of change in background regimen, subjects \nwho discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event (AE), death or lack or loss of efficacy and at the time of \ndiscontinuation had a viral load of \u2265 50 copies/mL. \n\nc Includes patients who discontinued due to an AE or death at any time point from day 1 through the time window if this \nresulted in no virologic data on treatment during the specified window. \n\nd Includes subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an AE, death or lack or loss of efficacy, e.g., withdrew consent, \nloss to follow-up, etc. \n\n \nElvitegravir was non-inferior in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when compared to raltegravir. \n \nAmong subjects with a genotypic sensitivity score of \u2264 1, 76% and 69% had HIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL at week 48 in the elvitegravir and raltegravir treatment arms, respectively.

The steady-state mean Cmax, \nAUCtau, and Ctrough (mean \u00b1 SD) following multiple doses of elvitegravir plus a ritonavir-boosted \nprotease inhibitor (150 mg elvitegravir with darunavir or fosamprenavir; 85 mg elvitegravir with \natazanavir or lopinavir) in HIV-1 infected subjects were 1.4 \u00b1 0.39 \u03bcg/mL, 18 \u00b1 6.8 \u03bcg\u2022h/mL, and \n0.38 \u00b1 0.22 \u03bcg/mL for elvitegravir, respectively.  The absolute oral bioavailability has not been \ndetermined. \n \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of boosted elvitegravir as the fixed-dose combination \n150 mg elvitegravir/150 mg cobicistat/200 mg emtricitabine/245 mg tenofovir disoproxil with a light \nmeal (approximately 373 kcal, 20% fat) or high-fat meal (approximately 800 kcal, 50% fat) resulted in \nincreased exposures of elvitegravir.  The Cmax and AUCtau of elvitegravir increased 22% and 36% with \na light meal, while increasing 56% and 91% with a high-fat meal, respectively. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nDistribution \nElvitegravir is 98-99% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent of drug \nconcentration over the range of 1.0 ng/mL to 1.6 \u00b5g/mL.  The mean plasma to blood drug \nconcentration ratio is 1.37. \n \nBiotransformation \nElvitegravir undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP3A (major route), and glucuronidation via \nUGT1A1/3 enzymes (minor route). \n \nRitonavir inhibits CYP3A, thereby substantially increasing the plasma concentrations of elvitegravir.  \nAdministration of once-daily ritonavir (20-200 mg) results in an increased elvitegravir exposure \nfollowing repeat once-daily administration, with elvitegravir exposure reaching a plateau with \napproximately 100 mg of ritonavir.  Further increases in ritonavir dose do not result in further \nincreases in elvitegravir exposure.  Vitekta is indicated for use only when co-administered with \nritonavir as a boosting agent. \n \nMean steady-state exposure (AUCtau) of unboosted elvitegravir is ~ 20% lower after multiple dosing \nversus a single dose, indicating modest autoinduction of its metabolism.  Upon boosting with ritonavir \n(100 mg), net inhibition of elvitegravir metabolism is observed with significantly increased systemic \nexposures (20-fold higher AUC), high trough concentrations, and longer median elimination half-life \n(9.5 versus 3.5 hours). \n \nFollowing oral administration of a single dose of ritonavir-boosted [14C]elvitegravir, elvitegravir was \nthe predominant species in plasma, representing approximately 94% and 61% of the circulating \nradioactivity at 32 and 48 hours, respectively.  Metabolites produced by aromatic and aliphatic \nhydroxylation or glucuronidation are present in very low levels and do not contribute to the overall \nantiviral activity of elvitegravir. \n \nElimination \nFollowing oral administration of ritonavir-boosted [14C]elvitegravir, 94.8% of the dose was recovered \nin faeces, consistent with the hepatobiliary elimination of elvitegravir; 6.7% of the administered dose \nwas recovered in urine as metabolites.  The median terminal plasma half-life of ritonavir-boosted \nelvitegravir is approximately 8.7 to 13.7 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nElvitegravir plasma exposures are non-linear and less than dose-proportional, likely due to solubility-\nlimited absorption. \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetics of elvitegravir have not been fully evaluated in the elderly (over 65 years of age). \n \nGender \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for boosted \nelvitegravir. \n \nEthnicity \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to ethnicity have been identified for boosted \nelvitegravir. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir in paediatric subjects have not been established. \n \nRenal impairment \nA study of the pharmacokinetics of boosted elvitegravir was performed in non HIV-1 infected subjects \nwith severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min).  No clinically \nrelevant differences in elvitegravir pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nrenal impairment and healthy subjects.  No dose adjustment of Vitekta is required for patients with \nrenal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nElvitegravir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  A study of the pharmacokinetics of \nboosted elvitegravir was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class B).  No clinically relevant differences in elvitegravir pharmacokinetics were \nobserved between subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects.  No dose adjustment of \nVitekta is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  The effect of severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir has not been studied. \n \nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \nLimited data from population pharmacokinetic analysis (n = 56) indicated that hepatitis B and/or \nC virus infection had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of boosted elvitegravir. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development.  The maximum doses of elvitegravir tested in the development toxicity studies in \nrats and rabbits corresponded to exposures that are approximately 29-fold and 0.2-fold the human \ntherapeutic exposure, respectively. \n \nElvitegravir was negative in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test) and negative in an \nin vivo rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 2,000 mg/kg.  In an in vitro chromosomal aberration test, \nelvitegravir was negative with metabolic activation; however, an equivocal response was observed \nwithout activation. \n \nElvitegravir did not show any carcinogenic potential in long-term oral carcinogenicity studies in mice \nand rats. \n \nThe active substance elvitegravir is persistent in the environment. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVitekta co-administered with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and with other antiretroviral \nagents, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults \nwho are infected with HIV-1 without known mutations associated with resistance to elvitegravir (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \nVitekta must be administered in combination with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor. \n \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics for the co-administered ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor \nshould be consulted. \n \nThe recommended dose of Vitekta is one 85 mg tablet or one 150 mg tablet taken orally once daily \nwith food.  The choice of dose of Vitekta depends on the co-administered protease inhibitor (see \nTable 1 and sections 4.4 and 4.5).  For use of the 85 mg tablet, please refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for Vitekta 85 mg tablets. \n \nVitekta should be administered once daily as follows: \n- Either at the same time as a once daily ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor \n- Or with the first dose of a twice daily ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 1: Recommended dosing regimens \n \nDose of Vitekta Dose of co-administered ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor \n\n85 mg once daily \natazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg once daily \n\nlopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily \n\n150 mg once daily \ndarunavir 600 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily \n\nfosamprenavir 700 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily \n\n \nThere are no data to recommend the use of Vitekta with dosing frequencies or HIV-1 protease \ninhibitors other than those presented in Table 1. \n \nMissed dose \nIf the patient misses a dose of Vitekta within 18 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Vitekta with food as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient misses \na dose of Vitekta by more than 18 hours, and it is almost time for their next dose, the patient should \nnot take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Vitekta another tablet should be taken. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n(see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Vitekta is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Vitekta is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B).  Elvitegravir has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of elvitegravir in children aged 0 to less than 18 years have not yet been \nestablished (see section 5.1).  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nVitekta should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated tablet should \nnot be chewed or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with the following medicinal products due to the potential for loss of virologic \nresponse and possible development of resistance (see section 4.5): \n\u2022 anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \n\u2022 antimycobacterials: rifampicin \n\u2022 herbal products: St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nThe use of Vitekta with HIV-1 protease inhibitors or dosing frequencies other than those presented in \nTable 1 may result in inadequate or elevated plasma levels of elvitegravir and/or the co-administered \nmedicinal products. \n \nResistance \nElvitegravir-resistant viruses show cross-resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir \nin most cases (see section 5.1). \n \nElvitegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance.  Therefore, whenever possible, Vitekta \nshould be administered with a fully active ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and a second fully \nactive antiretroviral agent to minimise the potential for virologic failure and the development of \nresistance (see section 5.1). \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \nElvitegravir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A.  Co-administration of Vitekta with strong CYP3A \ninducers (including St. John\u2019s wort [Hypericum perforatum], rifampicin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital and phenytoin) is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).  Co-administration of \nVitekta with moderate CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to, efavirenz and bosentan) is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \nDue to the need for co-administration of Vitekta with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, \nprescribers should consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered protease \ninhibitor and ritonavir for a description of contraindicated medicinal products and other significant \ndrug-drug interactions that may cause potentially life-threatening adverse reactions or loss of \ntherapeutic effect and possible development of resistance. \n \nAtazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir have been shown to significantly increase the plasma \nconcentrations of elvitegravir (see section 4.5).  When used in combination with atazanavir/ritonavir \nand lopinavir/ritonavir, the dose of Vitekta should be decreased from 150 mg once daily to 85 mg once \ndaily (see section 4.2).  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Vitekta 85 mg \ntablets. \n \nCo-administration of Vitekta and related active substances: Vitekta must be used in combination with \na ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor.  Vitekta should not be used with a protease inhibitor boosted by \nanother agent as dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established.  Boosting \nelvitegravir with an agent other than ritonavir may result in suboptimal plasma concentrations of \nelvitegravir and/or the protease inhibitor leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development \nof resistance. \n \nVitekta should not be used in combination with products containing elvitegravir or pharmacokinetic \nboosting agents other than ritonavir. \n \nContraception requirements \nFemale patients of childbearing potential should use either a hormonal contraceptive containing at \nleast 30 \u00b5g ethinylestradiol and containing norgestimate as the progestagen or should use an \nalternative reliable method of contraception (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).  Co-administration of \nelvitegravir with oral contraceptives containing progestagens other than norgestimate have not been \nstudied and, therefore, should be avoided. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nPatients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of \noestrogen deficiency (see section 4.5). \n \nOpportunistic infections \nPatients receiving Vitekta or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic \ninfections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical \nobservation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \nPatients with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus co-infection \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nPhysicians should refer to current HIV treatment guidelines for the optimal management of \nHIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). \n \nLiver disease \nElvitegravir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  No \ndose adjustment of Vitekta is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class B) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have also been reported to occur in the setting of \nimmune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nExcipients \nVitekta contains lactose.  Consequently, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nInteractions with CYP3A inducers \nElvitegravir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A (see section 5.2).  Medicinal products that are strong \n(causing a > 5-fold increase in substrate clearance) or moderate (causing a 2-5 fold increase in \nsubstrate clearance) inducers of CYP3A are expected to decrease plasma concentrations of \nelvitegravir. \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated \nCo-administration of Vitekta with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A is \ncontraindicated as the expected decrease in plasma concentrations of elvitegravir can lead to loss of \ntherapeutic effect and possible development of resistance to elvitegravir (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nCo-administration of Vitekta with medicinal products that are moderate inducers of CYP3A \n(including, but not limited to, efavirenz and bosentan) is not recommended as the expected decrease in \nplasma concentrations of elvitegravir can lead to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development \nof resistance to elvitegravir (see section 4.4). \n \nInteractions requiring dose adjustment of Vitekta \nElvitegravir undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP3A (major route), and glucuronidation by \nUGT1A1/3 enzymes (minor route).  Co-administration of Vitekta with medicinal products that are \npotent inhibitors of UGT1A1/3 may result in increased elvitegravir plasma concentrations and dose \nmodifications may be required.  For example, atazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir (potent \nUGT1A1/3 inhibitors) have been shown to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of \nelvitegravir (see Table 2).  Accordingly, when used in combination with atazanavir/ritonavir and \nlopinavir/ritonavir, the dose of Vitekta should be decreased from 150 mg once daily to 85 mg once \ndaily (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Vitekta \n85 mg tablets. \n \nOther interactions \nElvitegravir is a modest inducer and may have the potential to induce CYP2C9 and/or inducible UGT \nenzymes.  As such, elvitegravir may decrease the plasma concentration of substrates of CYP2C9 (such \nas warfarin) or UGT (such as ethinyl estradiol).  In addition, in vitro studies have shown that \nelvitegravir is a weak to modest inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A enzymes.  Elvitegravir \nwould also have potential to be a weak to modest inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 enzymes, as these \nenzymes are regulated in a similar manner to CYP2C9 and CYP3A.  However, clinical data have \nshown there are no clinically relevant changes in the exposure of methadone (which is primarily \nmetabolised by CYP2B6 and CYP2C19) following co-administration with boosted elvitegravir versus \nadministration of methadone alone (see Table 2). \n \nElvitegravir is a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and an inhibitor of OATP1B3 in vitro.  The \nin vivo relevance of these interactions is not clear. \n \nInteractions between elvitegravir and potential co-administered medicinal products are listed in \nTable 2 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d).  These interactions \nare based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of \ninteraction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of therapeutic effect. \n \nWhere interactions were studied, the effect on Vitekta was determined by comparing the \npharmacokinetics of boosted elvitegravir (using either ritonavir or cobicistat as a pharmacokinetic \nenhancer) in the absence and presence of the co-administered medicinal product.  No interactions were \nstudied using unboosted elvitegravir.  Except where indicated in Table 2, the dose of boosted \nelvitegravir or co-administered medicinal product was the same when administered alone or in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\ncombination.  The pharmacokinetic parameters of the protease inhibitors presented in Table 2 were \nassessed in the presence of ritonavir. \n \nAlthough there may be no actual or predicted interactions between a medicinal product and \nelvitegravir, there may be interactions between a medicinal product and ritonavir and/or the protease \ninhibitor co-administered with elvitegravir.  The prescriber should always refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for ritonavir, or the protease inhibitor. \n \nTable 2: Interactions between elvitegravir and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, \n\nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with \n\nritonavir-boosted elvitegravir \nANTIRETROVIRALS \nHIV protease inhibitors \nAtazanavir (300 mg once daily) \nElvitegravir (200 mg once daily) \nRitonavir (100 mg once daily) \n\nAtazanavir/Ritonavir has been \nshown to significantly increase \nthe plasma concentrations of \nelvitegravir. \n \nElvitegravir: \nAUC: \u2191 100% \nCmax: \u2191 85% \nCmin: \u2191 188% \n \nAtazanavir: \nAUC: \u2194 \nCmax: \u2194 \nCmin: \u2193 35% \n\nWhen used in combination with \natazanavir, the dose of Vitekta \nshould be 85 mg once daily.  \nWhen used in combination with \nVitekta, the recommended dose of \natazanavir is 300 mg with \nritonavir 100 mg once daily. \n \nThere are no data available to \nmake dosing recommendations for \nco-administration with other doses \nof atazanavir (see section 4.2). \n\nAtazanavir (300 mg once daily) \nElvitegravir (85 mg once daily) \nRitonavir (100 mg once daily) \n\nElvitegravir: \nAUC: \u2194* \nCmax: \u2194* \nCmin: \u2191 38%* \n \nAtazanavir: \nAUC: \u2194** \nCmax: \u2194** \nCmin: \u2194** \n \n*when compared to \nelvitegravir/ritonavir \n150/100 mg once daily. \n \n**when compared to \natazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg \nonce daily. \n\nDarunavir (600 mg twice daily) \nElvitegravir (125 mg once daily) \nRitonavir (100 mg twice daily) \n\nElvitegravir: \nAUC: \u2194 \nCmax: \u2194 \nCmin: \u2194 \n \nDarunavir: \nAUC: \u2194 \nCmax: \u2194 \nCmin: \u2193 17% \n\nWhen used in combination with \ndarunavir, the dose of Vitekta \nshould be 150 mg once daily. \n \nThere are no data available to \nmake dosing recommendations for \nco-administration with other doses \nof darunavir (see section 4.2).

Of these 712 patients, 543 \n(269 elvitegravir and 274 raltegravir) and 439 (224 elvitegravir and 215 raltegravir) received at least \n48 and 96 weeks of treatment, respectively. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions to elvitegravir were diarrhoea (7.1%) and nausea \n(4.0%) (see Table 3). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions to elvitegravir from clinical study experience are listed in Table 3 below, by body \nsystem organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) or \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100). \n \nTable 3: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions to elvitegravir based on experience for \n96 weeks from clinical study GS-US-183-0145 \n \nFrequency Adverse reaction \nPsychiatric disorders: \n\nUncommon suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness), depression, insomnia \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon headache \nUncommon dizziness, paraesthesia, somnolence, dysgeusia \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \nUncommon dyspepsia, abdominal distension, flatulence \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nCommon rash \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon fatigue \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is \nmore variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nDiarrhoea \nIn study GS-US-183-0145, diarrhoea was reported as an adverse reaction in 7.1% of subjects in the \nelvitegravir group and in 5.3% of subjects in the raltegravir group.  In these subjects, diarrhoea was \nmild to moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of study drug. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for children below 18 years of age.  Vitekta is not recommended in this \npopulation (see section 4.2). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity.  Treatment of overdose with \nelvitegravir consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as \nobservation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with elvitegravir.  As elvitegravir is highly bound to plasma \nproteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX11. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nElvitegravir is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  Integrase is an HIV-1 encoded \nenzyme that is required for viral replication.  Inhibition of integrase prevents the integration of \nHIV-1 DNA into host genomic DNA, blocking the formation of the HIV-1 provirus and propagation \nof the viral infection.  Elvitegravir does not inhibit human topoisomerases I or II. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \nThe antiviral activity of elvitegravir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cells, monocyte/macrophage cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes and the 50% \neffective concentration (EC50) values were in the range of 0.02 to 1.7 nM.  Elvitegravir displayed \nantiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged \nfrom 0.1 to 1.3 nM) and activity against HIV-2 (EC50 of 0.53 nM).  The in vitro antiviral activity of \nelvitegravir when combined with antiretroviral drugs from the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase \ninhibitor (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor (PI), \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n35 \n\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitor, fusion inhibitor, or CCR5 co-receptor antagonist classes showed no \nantagonism. \n \nElvitegravir did not show inhibition of replication of HBV or HCV in vitro. \n \nResistance \nIn cell culture \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir have been selected in cell culture.  \nPhenotypic resistance to elvitegravir was most commonly associated with the primary integrase \nsubstitutions T66I, E92Q and Q148R.  Additional integrase substitutions observed in cell culture \nselection included H51Y, F121Y, S147G, S153Y, E157Q, and R263K. \n \nCross resistance \nElvitegravir-resistant viruses show varying degrees of cross-resistance to the integrase strand transfer \ninhibitor raltegravir depending on the type and number of substitutions.  Viruses expressing the \nT66I/A substitutions maintain susceptibility to raltegravir, while most other patterns of \nelvitegravir-associated substitutions are associated with reduced susceptibility to raltegravir.  With the \nexception of Y143C/R/H, HIV-1 with the primary raltegravir-associated substitutions T66K, \nQ148H/K/R, or N155H in integrase is associated with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir. \n \nIn treatment-experienced patients \nIn an analysis of HIV-1 isolates from treatment-failure subjects in study GS-US-183-0145 through \nweek 96, the development of one or more primary elvitegravir resistance-associated substitutions was \nobserved in 23 of the 86 subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and elvitegravir \ntreatment-failure isolates (23/351 elvitegravir-treated subjects, 6.6%).  Similar rates of raltegravir \nresistance development occurred in the HIV-1 from subjects treated with raltegravir (26/351 \nraltegravir-treated subjects, 7.4%).  The most common substitutions that emerged in HIV-1 isolates \nfrom elvitegravir-treated subjects were T66I/A (n = 8), E92Q/G (n = 7), T97A (n = 4), S147G (n = 4), \nQ148R (n = 4), and N155H (n = 5) in integrase.  In phenotypic analyses of HIV-1 isolates with \nresistance substitutions from elvitegravir-treated subjects, 14/20 (70%) had reduced susceptibility to \nelvitegravir and 12/20 (60%) had reduced susceptibility to raltegravir. \n \nClinical experience \nIn treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients \nThe efficacy of elvitegravir is primarily based on the analyses through 96 weeks from one randomised, \ndouble-blind, active-controlled study, study GS-US-183-0145, in treatment-experienced, \nHIV-1 infected patients (n = 702). \n \nIn study GS-US-183-0145, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either elvitegravir \n(150 mg or 85 mg) once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, each administered with a background \nregimen (BR) containing a fully-active ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (either atazanavir, \ndarunavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir or tipranavir) and a second agent.  The BR was selected by the \ninvestigator based on genotypic/phenotypic resistance testing and prior antiretroviral treatment history.  \nRandomisation was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level (\u2264 100,000 copies/mL or \n> 100,000 copies/mL) and the class of the second agent (NRTI or other classes).  Virologic response \nrate was evaluated in both treatment arms.  Virologic response was defined as achieving an \nundetectable viral load (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL). \n \nBaseline characteristics and treatment outcomes through 96 weeks for study GS-US-183-0145 are \npresented in Tables 4 and 5 respectively. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n\nTable 4: Demographic and baseline disease characteristics of antiretroviral treatment-\nexperienced HIV-1 infected adult subjects in study GS-US-183-0145 \n \n \n \n\nElvitegravir + background \nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nRaltegravir + background \nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nDemographic characteristics \nMedian age, years (min-max) 44 \n\n(20-78) \n45 \n\n(19-74) \nSex   \n Male 83.2% 80.9% \n Female 16.8% 19.1% \nEthnicity   \n White 60.1% 64.4% \n Black/African American 35.6% 32.2% \n Asian 2.6% 1.4% \n Other 1.7% 2.0% \nBaseline disease characteristics \nMedian baseline plasma \nHIV-1 RNA (range) \nlog10 copies/mL \n\n4.35 \n(1.69-6.63) \n\n4.42 \n(1.69-6.10) \n\nPercentage of subjects with \nviral load > 100,000 copies/mL \n\n25.6 25.6 \n\nMedian baseline CD4+ cell \ncount (range), cells/mm3 \n\n227.0 \n(2.0-1,374.0) \n\n215.0 \n(1.0-1,497.0) \n\nPercentage of subjects with \nCD4+ cell counts \n\u2264 200 cells/mm3 \n\n44.4 \n \n\n44.9 \n\nBaseline genotypic sensitivity \nscorea \n\n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n\n \n \n\n1% \n14% \n81% \n3% \n\n \n \n\n< 1% \n15% \n83% \n2% \n\na Genotypic sensitivity scores are calculated by summing up drug susceptibility values (1 = sensitive; 0 = reduced \nsusceptibility) on all drugs in the baseline background regimen. \n\n \nTable 5: Virologic outcome of randomised treatment of study GS-US-183-0145 at week 48 and \nweek 96 (snapshot analysis)a \n \n Week 48 Week 96 \n Elvitegravir \n\n+ background \nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nRaltegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nElvitegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nRaltegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nVirologic success \nHIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL \n\n60% 58% 52% 53% \n\nTreatment difference 2.2% (95% CI = -5.0%, 9.3%) -0.5% (95% CI = -7.9%, 6.8%) \nVirologic failureb 33% 32% 36% 31% \nNo virologic data at \nweek 48 or week 96 \nwindow \n\n7% 11% 12% 16% \n\nDiscontinued study drug \ndue to AE or deathc \n\n2% 5% 3% 7% \n\nDiscontinued study drug 4% 5% 8% 9% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n\n Week 48 Week 96 \n Elvitegravir \n\n+ background \nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nRaltegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nElvitegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\nRaltegravir \n+ background \n\nregimen \nn = 351 \n\ndue to other reasons and \nlast available \nHIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mLd \nMissing data during \nwindow but on study \ndrug \n\n1% 1% 1% 1% \n\na Week 48 window is between day 309 and 364 (inclusive), week 96 window is between day 645 and 700 (inclusive). \nb Includes subjects who had \u2265 50 copies/mL in the week 48 or week 96 window, subjects who discontinued early due to \n\nlack or loss of efficacy, subjects who had a viral load \u2265 50 copies/mL at time of change in background regimen, subjects \nwho discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event (AE), death or lack or loss of efficacy and at the time of \ndiscontinuation had a viral load of \u2265 50 copies/mL. \n\nc Includes patients who discontinued due to an AE or death at any time point from day 1 through the time window if this \nresulted in no virologic data on treatment during the specified window. \n\nd Includes subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an AE, death or lack or loss of efficacy, e.g., withdrew consent, \nloss to follow-up, etc. \n\n \nElvitegravir was non-inferior in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when compared to raltegravir. \n \nAmong subjects with a genotypic sensitivity score of \u2264 1, 76% and 69% had HIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL at week 48 in the elvitegravir and raltegravir treatment arms, respectively.

The steady-state mean Cmax, \nAUCtau, and Ctrough (mean \u00b1 SD) following multiple doses of elvitegravir plus a ritonavir-boosted \nprotease inhibitor (150 mg elvitegravir with darunavir or fosamprenavir; 85 mg elvitegravir with \natazanavir or lopinavir) in HIV-1 infected subjects were 1.4 \u00b1 0.39 \u03bcg/mL, 18 \u00b1 6.8 \u03bcg\u2022h/mL, and \n0.38 \u00b1 0.22 \u03bcg/mL for elvitegravir, respectively.  The absolute oral bioavailability has not been \ndetermined. \n \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of boosted elvitegravir as the fixed-dose combination \n150 mg elvitegravir/150 mg cobicistat/200 mg emtricitabine/245 mg tenofovir disoproxil with a light \nmeal (approximately 373 kcal, 20% fat) or high-fat meal (approximately 800 kcal, 50% fat) resulted in \nincreased exposures of elvitegravir.  The Cmax and AUCtau of elvitegravir increased 22% and 36% with \na light meal, while increasing 56% and 91% with a high-fat meal, respectively. \n \nDistribution \nElvitegravir is 98-99% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent of drug \nconcentration over the range of 1.0 ng/mL to 1.6 \u00b5g/mL.  The mean plasma to blood drug \nconcentration ratio is 1.37. \n \nBiotransformation \nElvitegravir undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP3A (major route), and glucuronidation via \nUGT1A1/3 enzymes (minor route). \n \nRitonavir inhibits CYP3A, thereby substantially increasing the plasma concentrations of elvitegravir.  \nAdministration of once-daily ritonavir (20-200 mg) results in an increased elvitegravir exposure \nfollowing repeat once-daily administration, with elvitegravir exposure reaching a plateau with \napproximately 100 mg of ritonavir.  Further increases in ritonavir dose do not result in further \nincreases in elvitegravir exposure.  Vitekta is indicated for use only when co-administered with \nritonavir as a boosting agent. \n \nMean steady-state exposure (AUCtau) of unboosted elvitegravir is ~ 20% lower after multiple dosing \nversus a single dose, indicating modest autoinduction of its metabolism.  Upon boosting with ritonavir \n(100 mg), net inhibition of elvitegravir metabolism is observed with significantly increased systemic \nexposures (20-fold higher AUC), high trough concentrations, and longer median elimination half-life \n(9.5 versus 3.5 hours). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\nFollowing oral administration of a single dose of ritonavir-boosted [14C]elvitegravir, elvitegravir was \nthe predominant species in plasma, representing approximately 94% and 61% of the circulating \nradioactivity at 32 and 48 hours, respectively.  Metabolites produced by aromatic and aliphatic \nhydroxylation or glucuronidation are present in very low levels and do not contribute to the overall \nantiviral activity of elvitegravir. \n \nElimination \nFollowing oral administration of ritonavir-boosted [14C]elvitegravir, 94.8% of the dose was recovered \nin faeces, consistent with the hepatobiliary elimination of elvitegravir; 6.7% of the administered dose \nwas recovered in urine as metabolites.  The median terminal plasma half-life of ritonavir-boosted \nelvitegravir is approximately 8.7 to 13.7 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nElvitegravir plasma exposures are non-linear and less than dose-proportional, likely due to solubility-\nlimited absorption. \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetics of elvitegravir have not been fully evaluated in the elderly (over 65 years of age). \n \nGender \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for boosted \nelvitegravir. \n \nEthnicity \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to ethnicity have been identified for boosted \nelvitegravir. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir in paediatric subjects have not been established. \n \nRenal impairment \nA study of the pharmacokinetics of boosted elvitegravir was performed in non HIV-1 infected subjects \nwith severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min).  No clinically \nrelevant differences in elvitegravir pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe \nrenal impairment and healthy subjects.  No dose adjustment of Vitekta is required for patients with \nrenal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nElvitegravir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  A study of the pharmacokinetics of \nboosted elvitegravir was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class B).  No clinically relevant differences in elvitegravir pharmacokinetics were \nobserved between subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects.  No dose adjustment of \nVitekta is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  The effect of severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir has not been studied. \n \nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \nLimited data from population pharmacokinetic analysis (n = 56) indicated that hepatitis B and/or \nC virus infection had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of boosted elvitegravir. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development.  The maximum doses of elvitegravir tested in the development toxicity studies in \nrats and rabbits corresponded to exposures that are approximately 29-fold and 0.2-fold the human \ntherapeutic exposure, respectively. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nElvitegravir was negative in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test) and negative in an \nin vivo rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 2,000 mg/kg.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information.  You can help by reporting any side effects you may get.  See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Vitekta is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Vitekta \n3. How to take Vitekta \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vitekta \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vitekta is and what it is used for \n \nVitekta contains the active substance elvitegravir. \n \nVitekta is a treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults aged 18 years \nand over. \n \nVitekta must always be taken with certain other HIV medicines.  See section 3, How to take \nVitekta. \n \nThe HIV virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase.  This enzyme helps the virus to multiply in \nthe cells in your body.  Vitekta stops this enzyme working and reduces the amount of HIV in your \nbody.  This will improve your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to \nHIV infection. \n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Vitekta you may still develop infections \nor other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vitekta \n \nDo not take Vitekta \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to elvitegravir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 of this leaflet). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n52 \n\n\u2022 if you are taking one of these medicines: \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures \n- rifampicin, used to prevent and treat tuberculosis and other infections \n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for depression and \n\nanxiety, or products that contain it \n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, do not take Vitekta and tell your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYour treatment with Vitekta should only be started by a doctor who is experienced in treating \nHIV infection. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Vitekta you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Vitekta: \n \n\u2022 If you have liver problems or a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for you. \n\n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, talk to your doctor before taking Vitekta. \n \nWhile you are taking Vitekta \n \nLook out for the following: \n \n\u2022 any signs of inflammation or infection \n \n\u2022 bone problems \n \n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.  For more information see \n\nsection 4 of this leaflet. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age.  The use of \n\nVitekta in children and adolescents has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Vitekta \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, plan to take, or have recently taken any other \nmedicines.  This includes medicines and herbal products obtained without a prescription.  Vitekta may \ninteract with other medicines which can affect the amounts of Vitekta or other medicines in your \nblood.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. \n \nMedicines that should never be taken with Vitekta: \n\u2022 carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures \n\u2022 rifampicin, used to prevent and treat tuberculosis and other infections \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety, or \n\nproducts that contain it \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n\nOther medicines used in treating HIV infection: \nYou should not take Vitekta with other medicines containing: \n\u2022 cobicistat \n\u2022 elvitegravir \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are taking: \n\u2022 efavirenz \n\u2022 nevirapine \n\u2022 didanosine (see also section 3 of this leaflet) \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these HIV medicines. \n \nOther types of medicine: \nTalk to your doctor if you are taking: \n\u2022 rifabutin, used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis \n\u2022 warfarin, used to thin the blood \n\u2022 contraceptive pill, used to prevent pregnancy \n\u2022 bosentan, used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension \n\u2022 antacids, used to treat heartburn or acid reflux, such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or \n\ncalcium carbonate (see also section 3 of this leaflet) \n\u2022 multivitamins, used to supplement your diet (see also section 3 of this leaflet). \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if you are taking these or any other medicines.  Do not stop your treatment \n\nwithout contacting your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n\u2022 Women must not get pregnant while taking Vitekta. \n\u2022 Use effective contraception while taking Vitekta. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant.  If you are pregnant, you should not \n\ntake Vitekta unless you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed.  Your doctor will discuss the \npotential benefits and risks of taking Vitekta to you and your child. \n\n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Vitekta: It is not known if the active substance in this \nmedicine can pass into human breast milk.  If you are a woman with HIV it is recommended that you \ndo not breast-feed to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nVitekta contains lactose \n \nTell your doctor if you are lactose intolerant or intolerant to other sugars.  Vitekta contains \nlactose.  If you are lactose-intolerant, or if you have been told that you have an intolerance to other \nsugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Vitekta \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  This is to make sure that your medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of \ndeveloping resistance to the treatment.  Do not change the dose unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nYou must always take Vitekta with one of the following combinations of medicines: \n \n\u2022 atazanavir and ritonavir \n\u2022 darunavir and ritonavir \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54 \n\n\u2022 fosamprenavir and ritonavir \n\u2022 lopinavir/ritonavir \n \nA dose of 85 mg is recommended: \nIf you are taking Vitekta with: \n\u2022 atazanavir and ritonavir \n\u2022 lopinavir/ritonavir \n \nIn these combinations the dose is one 85 mg tablet each day, with food.  Do not chew, crush or \nsplit the tablet.  Take the 85 mg tablet at the same time as atazanavir and ritonavir, or at the same time \nas the first dose of lopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nA dose of 150 mg is recommended: \nIf you are taking Vitekta with: \n\u2022 darunavir and ritonavir \n\u2022 fosamprenavir and ritonavir \n \nIn these combinations the dose is one 150 mg tablet each day, with food.  Do not chew, crush or \nsplit the tablet.  Take the 150 mg tablet at the same time as the first dose of darunavir or fosamprenavir \nand ritonavir.  Refer to the package leaflet for Vitekta 150 mg tablets. \n \nIf you are also taking other medicines: \n \nIf you are also taking didanosine, take it at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after Vitekta. \n \nIf you are also taking an antacid such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate, or \na multivitamin supplement, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after Vitekta. \n \nIf you take more Vitekta than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Vitekta you may be at increased risk of \nexperiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4 of this leaflet). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Vitekta \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Vitekta. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n\u2022 If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Vitekta, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Always take the tablet with food.  Then take the next dose as usual. \n\u2022 If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Vitekta, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose.  Wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Vitekta, take another tablet with food. \n \nDo not stop taking Vitekta \n \nDo not stop taking Vitekta without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Vitekta can seriously affect \nyour response to future treatment.  If Vitekta is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before \nyou restart taking Vitekta tablets. \n \nWhen your supply of Vitekta starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55 \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are \ncaused by Vitekta or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV infection \nitself. \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect 1 to 10 in every 100 patients treated) \n\u2022 stomach pain \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 rashes \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 tiredness. \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in every 100 patients treated) \n\u2022 suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts (in patients who have had depression or mental health \n\nproblems before) \n\u2022 depression \n\u2022 difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n\u2022 problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) \n\u2022 feeling bloated \n\u2022 wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 tingling \n\u2022 sleepiness \n\u2022 abnormal taste. \n \n\uf0e0 If you think that you may have any of these side effects, talk to your doctor. \n \nOther effects that may be seen during HIV treatment \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data): \n \n\u2022 Any signs of inflammation or infection.  If you have advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and \n\nhave an infection, you may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of \nthe symptoms of an existing infection once treatment with Vitekta is started.  These symptoms \nmay indicate that your body\u2019s improved immune system is fighting infection.  Look out for \nsigns of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking Vitekta.  If you notice signs of \ninflammation or infection, tell your doctor at once.  In addition to the opportunistic infections, \nautoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body \ntissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection.  \nAutoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment.  If you notice any \nsymptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n56 \n\nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or \nhyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n \n\u2022 Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone \n\ndisease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  \nThe length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, \nsevere immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many \nrisk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n- joint stiffness \n- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n- difficulty with movement. \nIf you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n\uf0e0 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on \nthe safety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n5. How to store Vitekta \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle and carton after {EXP}.  \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

What Vitekta is and what it is used for \n \nVitekta contains the active substance elvitegravir. \n \nVitekta is a treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults aged 18 years \nand over. \n \nVitekta must always be taken with certain other HIV medicines.  See section 3, How to take \nVitekta. \n \nThe HIV virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase.  This enzyme helps the virus to multiply in \nthe cells in your body.  Vitekta stops this enzyme working and reduces the amount of HIV in your \nbody.  This will improve your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to \nHIV infection. \n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Vitekta you may still develop infections \nor other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vitekta \n \nDo not take Vitekta \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to elvitegravir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 of this leaflet). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n60 \n\n\u2022 if you are taking one of these medicines: \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures \n- rifampicin, used to prevent and treat tuberculosis and other infections \n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for depression and \n\nanxiety, or products that contain it \n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, do not take Vitekta and tell your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYour treatment with Vitekta should only be started by a doctor who is experienced in treating \nHIV infection. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Vitekta you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Vitekta: \n \n\u2022 If you have liver problems or a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for you. \n\n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, talk to your doctor before taking Vitekta. \n \nWhile you are taking Vitekta \n \nLook out for the following: \n \n\u2022 any signs of inflammation or infection \n \n\u2022 bone problems \n \n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.  For more information see \n\nsection 4 of this leaflet. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age.  The use of \n\nVitekta in children and adolescents has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Vitekta \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, plan to take, or have recently taken any other \nmedicines.  This includes medicines and herbal products obtained without a prescription.  Vitekta may \ninteract with other medicines which can affect the amounts of Vitekta or other medicines in your \nblood.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. \n \nMedicines that should never be taken with Vitekta: \n\u2022 carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures \n\u2022 rifampicin, used to prevent and treat tuberculosis and other infections \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety, or \n\nproducts that contain it \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n61 \n\nOther medicines used in treating HIV infection: \nYou should not take Vitekta with other medicines containing: \n\u2022 cobicistat \n\u2022 elvitegravir \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are taking: \n\u2022 efavirenz \n\u2022 nevirapine \n\u2022 didanosine (see also section 3 of this leaflet) \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these HIV medicines. \n \nOther types of medicine: \nTalk to your doctor if you are taking: \n\u2022 rifabutin, used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis \n\u2022 warfarin, used to thin the blood \n\u2022 contraceptive pill, used to prevent pregnancy \n\u2022 bosentan, used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension \n\u2022 antacids, used to treat heartburn or acid reflux, such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or \n\ncalcium carbonate (see also section 3 of this leaflet) \n\u2022 multivitamins, used to supplement your diet (see also section 3 of this leaflet). \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if you are taking these or any other medicines.  Do not stop your treatment \n\nwithout contacting your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n\u2022 Women must not get pregnant while taking Vitekta. \n\u2022 Use effective contraception while taking Vitekta. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant.  If you are pregnant, you should not \n\ntake Vitekta unless you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed.  Your doctor will discuss the \npotential benefits and risks of taking Vitekta to you and your child. \n\n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Vitekta: It is not known if the active substance in this \nmedicine can pass into human breast milk.  If you are a woman with HIV it is recommended that you \ndo not breast-feed to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nVitekta contains lactose \n \nTell your doctor if you are lactose intolerant or intolerant to other sugars.  Vitekta contains \nlactose.  If you are lactose-intolerant, or if you have been told that you have an intolerance to other \nsugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Vitekta \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  This is to make sure that your medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of \ndeveloping resistance to the treatment.  Do not change the dose unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nYou must always take Vitekta with one of the following combinations of medicines: \n \n\u2022 atazanavir and ritonavir \n\u2022 darunavir and ritonavir \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n62 \n\n\u2022 fosamprenavir and ritonavir \n\u2022 lopinavir/ritonavir \n \nA dose of 150 mg is recommended: \nIf you are taking Vitekta with: \n\u2022 darunavir and ritonavir \n\u2022 fosamprenavir and ritonavir \n \nIn these combinations the dose is one 150 mg tablet each day, with food.  Do not chew, crush or \nsplit the tablet.  Take the 150 mg tablet at the same time as the first dose of darunavir or fosamprenavir \nand ritonavir. \n \nA dose of 85 mg is recommended: \nIf you are taking Vitekta with: \n\u2022 atazanavir and ritonavir \n\u2022 lopinavir/ritonavir \n \nIn these combinations the dose is one 85 mg tablet each day, with food.  Do not chew, crush or \nsplit the tablet.  Take the 85 mg tablet at the same time as atazanavir and ritonavir, or at the same time \nas the first dose of lopinavir/ritonavir.  Refer to the package leaflet for Vitekta 85 mg tablets. \n \nIf you are also taking other medicines: \n \nIf you are also taking didanosine, take it at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after Vitekta. \n \nIf you are also taking an antacid such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate, or \na multivitamin supplement, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after Vitekta. \n \nIf you take more Vitekta than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Vitekta you may be at increased risk of \nexperiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4 of this leaflet). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Vitekta \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Vitekta. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n\u2022 If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Vitekta, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Always take the tablet with food.  Then take the next dose as usual. \n\u2022 If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Vitekta, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose.  Wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Vitekta, take another tablet with food. \n \nDo not stop taking Vitekta \n \nDo not stop taking Vitekta without talking to your doctor.

If Vitekta is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before \nyou restart taking Vitekta tablets. \n \nWhen your supply of Vitekta starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are \ncaused by Vitekta or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV infection \nitself. \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect 1 to 10 in every 100 patients treated) \n\u2022 stomach pain \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 rashes \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 tiredness. \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in every 100 patients treated) \n\u2022 suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts (in patients who have had depression or mental health \n\nproblems before) \n\u2022 depression \n\u2022 difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n\u2022 problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) \n\u2022 feeling bloated \n\u2022 wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 tingling \n\u2022 sleepiness \n\u2022 abnormal taste. \n \n\uf0e0 If you think that you may have any of these side effects, talk to your doctor. \n \nOther effects that may be seen during HIV treatment \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data): \n \n\u2022 Any signs of inflammation or infection.  If you have advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and \n\nhave an infection, you may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of \nthe symptoms of an existing infection once treatment with Vitekta is started.  These symptoms \nmay indicate that your body\u2019s improved immune system is fighting infection.  Look out for \nsigns of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking Vitekta.  If you notice signs of \ninflammation or infection, tell your doctor at once.  In addition to the opportunistic infections, \nautoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body \ntissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection.  \nAutoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment.  If you notice any \nsymptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n64 \n\nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or \nhyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n \n\u2022 Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone \n\ndisease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  \nThe length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, \nsevere immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many \nrisk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n- joint stiffness \n- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n- difficulty with movement. \nIf you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n\uf0e0 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on \nthe safety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n5.

vitekta", "Section_Content": "always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. this is to make sure that your medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment. do not change the dose unless your doctor tells you to. you must always take vitekta with one of the following combinations of medicines: atazanavir and ritonavir darunavir and ritonavir 54 fosamprenavir and ritonavir lopinavir/ritonavir a dose of 85 mg is recommended: if you are taking vitekta with: atazanavir and ritonavir lopinavir/ritonavir in these combinations the dose is one 85 mg tablet each day, with food. do not chew, crush or split the tablet. take the 85 mg tablet at the same time as atazanavir and ritonavir, or at the same time as the first dose of lopinavir/ritonavir. a dose of 150 mg is recommended: if you are taking vitekta with: darunavir and ritonavir fosamprenavir and ritonavir in these combinations the dose is one 150 mg tablet each day, with food. do not chew, crush or split the tablet. take the 150 mg tablet at the same time as the first dose of darunavir or fosamprenavir and ritonavir. refer to the package leaflet for vitekta 150 mg tablets. if you are also taking other medicines: if you are also taking didanosine, take it at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after vitekta. if you are also taking an antacid such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate, or a multivitamin supplement, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after vitekta. if you take more vitekta than you should if you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of vitekta you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4 of this leaflet). contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take vitekta it is important not to miss a dose of vitekta. if you do miss a dose: if you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take vitekta, you must take the tablet as soon as possible. always take the tablet with food. then take the next dose as usual. if you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take vitekta, then do not take the missed dose. wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. if you vomit less than 1 hour after taking vitekta, take another tablet with food. do not stop taking vitekta do not stop taking vitekta without talking to your doctor. stopping vitekta can seriously affect your response to future treatment. if vitekta is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you restart taking vitekta tablets. when your supply of vitekta starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. this is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. the disease may then become harder to treat. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "vitekta", "Type":

therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. when treating hiv infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are caused by vitekta or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the hiv infection itself. common side effects (may affect 1 to 10 in every 100 patients treated) stomach pain vomiting rashes headache diarrhoea feeling sick (nausea) tiredness. uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in every 100 patients treated) suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts (in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before) depression difficulty sleeping (insomnia) problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) feeling bloated wind (flatulence) dizziness tingling sleepiness abnormal taste. if you think that you may have any of these side effects, talk to your doctor. other effects that may be seen during hiv treatment the frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): any signs of inflammation or infection. if you have advanced hiv infection (aids) and have an infection, you may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of an existing infection once treatment with vitekta is started. these symptoms may indicate that your body's improved immune system is fighting infection. look out for signs of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking vitekta. if you notice signs of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor at once. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the 56 hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. bone problems. some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). the length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are: - joint stiffness - joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) - difficulty with movement. if you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this
