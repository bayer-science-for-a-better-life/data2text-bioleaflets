This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGivlaari 189 mg/mL solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of solution contains givosiran sodium equivalent to 189 mg givosiran. \n \nEach vial contains 189 mg givosiran. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless to yellow solution (pH of approximately 7.0; osmolality: 275 – 295 mOsm/kg). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nGivlaari is indicated for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) in adults and adolescents aged \n12 years and older. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the \nmanagement of porphyria. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Givlaari is 2.5 mg/kg once monthly, administered via subcutaneous \ninjection. Dosing is based on actual body weight. \n \nThe patient dose (in mg) and volume (in mL) should be calculated as follows: \n \nPatient body weight (kg) × dose (2.5 mg/kg) = total amount (mg) of medicinal product to be \nadministered. \nTotal amount (mg) divided by vial concentration (189 mg/mL) = total volume of medicinal product \n(mL) to be injected. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be administered as soon as possible. Dosing should be resumed at \nmonthly intervals following administration of the missed dose. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose modification for adverse reactions \nIn patients with clinically relevant transaminase elevations, who have dose interruption and subsequent \nimprovement in transaminase levels, a dose resumption at 1.25 mg/kg once monthly could be \nconsidered (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients aged > 65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 1× the upper \nlimit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 1×ULN, or bilirubin > 1×ULN to \n1.5×ULN). Givlaari has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (estimated \nglomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 15 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m²). Givlaari has not been studied in \npatients with end-stage renal disease or patients on dialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age (see section 5.2). The safety \nand efficacy of Givlaari in children aged < 12 years of age has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor subcutaneous use only. \n \nThis medicinal product is provided as a ready-to-use solution in a single use vial. \n \n• The required volume of Givlaari should be calculated based on the recommended weight-based \n\ndose. \n• The maximum acceptable single injection volume is 1.5 mL. If the dose is more than 1 mL, \n\nmore than one vial will be needed. \n• Doses requiring more than 1.5 mL should be administered as multiple injections (the total \n\nmonthly dose divided equally between syringes with each injection containing approximately \nthe same volume) to minimise potential injection site discomfort due to injection volume. \n\n• This medicinal product should be injected subcutaneously into the abdomen; alternative \ninjection sites include the thigh or upper arm. \n\n• For subsequent injections or doses, rotating the injection site is recommended. \n• This medicinal product should not be administered into scar tissue or areas that are reddened, \n\ninflamed, or swollen. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSevere hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylaxis) to the active substance or to any excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients with AHP subtypes other than acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) \n \nThe efficacy and safety data in patients with AHP subtypes other than AIP (hereditary coproporphyria \n(HCP), variegate porphyria (VP) and ALA dehydratase-deficient porphyria (ADP)) are limited (see \n\n\n\n4 \n\nsection 5.1). This should be taken into consideration when assessing the individual benefit-risk in these \nrare AHP subtypes. \n \nAnaphylactic reaction \n \nIn clinical studies, anaphylaxis occurred in one patient who had a history of allergic asthma and atopy \n(see section 4.8). Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis should be monitored. If anaphylaxis occurs, \nadministration of this medicinal product should be immediately discontinued and appropriate medical \ntreatment should be instituted. \n \nTransaminase elevations \n \nTransaminase elevations have been observed in patients treated with givosiran. Transaminase \nelevations primarily occurred between 3 to 5 months following initiation of treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nLiver function tests should be performed prior to initiating treatment. These tests should be repeated \nmonthly during the first 6 months of treatment, and as clinically indicated thereafter. Interrupting or \ndiscontinuing treatment should be considered for clinically relevant transaminase elevations. In case of \nsubsequent improvement in transaminase levels, resumption of treatment at a 1.25 mg/kg dose after \ninterruption could be considered (see section 4.2). There are limited data on efficacy and safety of the \nlower dose, particularly in patients who previously experienced transaminase elevations. There are no \ndata on sequentially increasing the 1.25 mg/kg dose to the 2.5 mg/kg dose after dose interruption for \ntransaminase elevations (see section 4.8). \n \nEffects on renal function \n \nIncreases in serum creatinine levels and decreases in eGFR have been reported during treatment with \ngivosiran. In the placebo-controlled study, the median increase in creatinine at month 3 was \n6.5 µmol/L (0.07 mg/dL) and resolved or stabilised by month 6 with continued monthly treatment with \n2.5 mg/kg givosiran. \n \nProgression of renal impairment has been observed in some patients with pre-existing renal disease. \nCareful monitoring of renal function during treatment is required in such cases. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a clinical drug-drug interaction study, givosiran resulted in a weak to moderate reduction in activity \nof certain CYP450 enzymes in the liver thereby increasing plasma exposures: \n• CYP1A2: 1.3-fold increase in Cmax and 3.1-fold increase in AUC0–∞ of caffeine \n• CYP2D6: 2.0-fold increase in Cmax and 2.4-fold increase in AUC0–∞ of dextromethorphan \n• CYP2C19: 1.1-fold increase in Cmax and 1.6-fold increase in AUC0–∞ of omeprazole \n• CYP3A4: 1.2-fold increase in Cmax and 1.5-fold increase in AUC0–∞ of midazolam \n• CYP2C9: no effect on the exposure of losartan \n \nCaution is recommended during the use of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP1A2 or \nCYP2D6 while on treatment with Givlaari as this medicinal product may increase or prolong their \ntherapeutic effect, or alter their adverse event profiles Consider decreasing the CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 \nsubstrate dosage in accordance with the approved product labelling. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of givosiran in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity in the presence of maternal toxicity (see section 5.3). The \nuse of this medicinal product could be considered during pregnancy taking into account the expected \nhealth benefit for the woman and potential risks to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether givosiran is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of \ngivosiran in milk (see section 5.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or \nto discontinue/abstain from Givlaari therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of givosiran on human fertility. No impact on male or female fertility \nwas detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGivlaari has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently occurring adverse reactions reported in patients treated with givosiran are \ninjection site reactions (ISRs) (36 %), nausea (32.4 %) and fatigue (22.5 %). The adverse reactions \nresulting in discontinuation of treatment were elevated transaminases (0.9 %) and anaphylactic \nreaction (0.9 %). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are presented as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA system organ \nclass (SOC) by frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. The frequency of the adverse reactions is expressed according to the following \ncategories: \n• Very common (≥ 1/10) \n• Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n• Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nImmune system disorders \nAnaphylactic reaction Uncommon \n\nHypersensitivity Common \nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Very common \nHepatobiliary disorders Transaminase elevations Very common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders Rash\n\na Very common \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Glomerular filtration rate decreasedb Very common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Very common \nFatigue Very common \n\na Includes pruritus, eczema, erythema, rash, rash pruritic, urticaria. \nb Includes blood creatinine increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, chronic kidney disease (decreased \n\neGFR), renal impairment. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLiver function tests \nIn the placebo-controlled study, 7 (14.6 %) patients treated with givosiran and one (2.2 %) patient \ntreated with placebo had an increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than 3 times the ULN. In \n5 patients treated with givosiran the transaminase elevations resolved with ongoing dosing at \n2.5 mg/kg. Per protocol, one patient (with variegate porphyria) with ALT more than 8 times the ULN \ndiscontinued treatment and one patient with ALT more than 5 times the ULN interrupted treatment and \nresumed dosing at 1.25 mg/kg. ALT elevations in both patients resolved. \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn placebo-controlled and open-label clinical studies, injection site reactions have been reported in \n36 % of patients and generally have been mild or moderate in severity, mostly transient and resolved \nwithout treatment. The most commonly reported symptoms included erythema, pain, and pruritus. \nInjection-site reactions occurred in 7.8 % of injections and did not result in discontinuation of \ntreatment. Three patients (2.7 %) experienced single, transient, recall reactions of erythema at a prior \ninjection site with a subsequent dose administration. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn placebo-controlled and open-label clinical studies, 1 of 111 patients with AHP (0.9 %), developed \ntreatment emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) during treatment with givosiran. ADA titres were low \nand transient with no evidence of an effect on clinical efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic or \npharmacodynamic profiles of the medicinal product. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be \nmonitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be \ninstituted. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned, ATC code: not yet assigned \n \nMechanism of action \n \nGivosiran is a double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) that causes degradation of \naminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in hepatocytes through \nRNA interference, resulting in a reduction of induced liver ALAS1 mRNA towards normal. This leads \nto reduced circulating levels of neurotoxic intermediates aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and \nporphobilinogen (PBG), the key causal factors of attacks and other disease manifestations of AHP. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn the placebo-controlled study in patients with AHP receiving givosiran 2.5 mg/kg once monthly \n(ENVISION), median reductions from baseline in urinary ALA and PBG of 83.7 % and 75.1 %, \nrespectively, were observed 14 days after the first dose. Maximal reductions in ALA and PBG levels \nwere achieved around month 3 with median reductions from baseline of 93.8 % for ALA and 94.5 % \nfor PBG, and were sustained with repeated once monthly dosing. \n \nObserved data and modelling demonstrated that once monthly dosing with 2.5 mg/kg givosiran \nresulted in a greater reduction and less fluctuation in ALA levels compared with doses less than \n2.5 mg/kg or dosing once every 3 months. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe efficacy of givosiran was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nmultinational study (ENVISION). \n \nENVISION \nA total number of 94 patients with AHP (89 patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), 2 patients \nwith variegate porphyria (VP), 1 patient with hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and 2 patients with no \nidentified mutation in a porphyria-related gene) were randomised 1:1 to receive once monthly \nsubcutaneous injections of givosiran 2.5 mg/kg or placebo during the 6-month double-blind period. \nPatients randomised to givosiran included 46 patients with AIP, 1 patient with VP, and 1 patient with \nHCP. In this study, inclusion criteria specified a minimum of 2 porphyria attacks requiring \nhospitalisation, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous (IV) hemin administration at home in the \n6 months prior to study entry. Hemin use during the study was permitted for the treatment of acute \nporphyria attacks. The median age of patients in the ENVISION study was 37.5 years (range 19 to \n65 years); 89.4 % of patients were female, and 77.7 % were white. The treatment arms were balanced \nwith respect to historical annualised porphyria attack rate (overall median baseline rate of 8 per year), \nprior hemin prophylaxis, use of opioid medicinal products, and patient-reported measures of chronic \nsymptoms between attacks. \n \nThe major efficacy measure was the annualised attack rate (AAR) of composite porphyria attacks \nduring the 6-month double-blind period and consisted of three components: attacks requiring \nhospitalisation, urgent healthcare visit, or IV hemin administration at home. This composite efficacy \nmeasure was evaluated as the primary endpoint in patients with AIP, and as a secondary endpoint in \nthe overall population of patients with AHP. Treatment with this medicinal product resulted in a \nsignificant reduction of the AAR of composite porphyria attacks, compared with placebo, of 74 % in \npatients with AIP (Table 2). Comparable results were seen in patients with AHP, with a reduction of \n73 %. Consistent results were observed for each of the 3 components of the composite porphyria attack \nendpoint. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe results observed over 6 months were maintained through Month 12, with a median AAR (Q1, Q3) \nof 0.0 (0.0, 3.5) observed for patients with continued dosing with the medicinal product during the \nopen-label extension period. \n \nGivosiran reduced porphyria attacks compared to placebo in patients with AHP across all pre-specified \nsubgroups, including age, sex, race, region, baseline body mass index (BMI), prior hemin prophylaxis \nuse, historical attack rate, prior chronic opioid use when not having attacks, and the presence of prior \nchronic symptoms when not having attacks. \n \nAdditional clinical efficacy endpoints were studied in AIP patients and are summarised in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Clinical Efficacy Results in Patients with AIP during the 6-Month Double-Blind Period \nof the ENVISION Study \n\nEndpoint \nPlacebo Givosiran \n(N=43) (N=46) \n\nAnnualised attack rate of composite porphyria attacksa \nMean AAR (95 % CI)b 12.5 (9.4, 16.8) 3.2 (2.3, 4.6) \nRate ratio (95 % CI)b (givosiran/placebo) 0.26 (0.16, 0.41) \nP-valueb < 0.001 \nMedian AAR, (Q1, Q3) 10.7 (2.2, 26.1) 1.0 (0.0, 6.2) \nNumber of patients with 0 attacks (%) 7 (16.3) 23 (50.0) \nAnnualised days of hemin use \nMean (95 % CI)b 29.7 (18.4, 47.9) 6.8 (4.2, 10.9) \nRatio (95 % CI)b (givosiran/placebo) 0.23 (0.11, 0.45) \nP-valueb < 0.001 \nDaily worst pain scorec \nBaseline, median (Q1, Q3) 3.3 (1.9, 5.6) 2.2 (1.2, 4.5) \nMedian of treatment difference (95 %) \n(givosiran-placebo) −10.1 (−22.8, 0.9) \n\nP-value < 0.05 \nPCS of SF-12d \nBaseline, mean (SD) 38.4 (9.4) 39.4 (9.6) \nChange from baseline at Month 6, LS mean \n(95 % CI) 1.4 (−1.0, 3.9) 5.4 (3.0, 7.7) \n\nLS mean difference (95 % CI) (givosiran-\nplacebo) 3.9 (0.6, 7.3) \n\nNominal P-value < 0.05 \nAAR, Annualised Attack Rate; AIP, Acute Intermittent Porphyria; CI, Confidence Interval; Q1, Quartile 1; Q3, \nQuartile 3; LS, Least Square; PCS, Physical Component Summary; SF-12, the 12-item Short-Form Health \nSurvey \na Composite porphyria attacks includes three components: attacks requiring hospitalisation, urgent healthcare \n\nvisits, or IV hemin administration at home. \nb Based on negative binomial regression model.

At the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dose, the steady-state peak \nplasma concentrations of givosiran (Cmax) and area under the curve from time of dosing up to 24 hours \nafter dosing (AUC24) were 321 ± 163 ng/mL and 4130 ± 1780 ng·h/mL, respectively, and \ncorresponding values for the active metabolite were 123 ± 79.0 ng/mL and 1930 ± 1210 ng·h/mL, \nrespectively. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nDistribution \n \nGivosiran is greater than 90 % bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range observed in \nhumans at the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dose. The population estimate for the steady state apparent \nvolume of distribution (Vd/F) for givosiran and for the active metabolite was 10.4 L. Givosiran and its \nactive metabolite distribute primarily to the liver after subcutaneous dosing. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nGivosiran is metabolised by nucleases to oligonucleotides of shorter lengths. Active metabolite \nAS(N-1)3’ givosiran (with equal potency as that of givosiran) was a major metabolite in plasma with \n45 % exposure (AUC0–24) relative to givosiran at the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dose. In vitro studies \nindicate that givosiran does not undergo metabolism by CYP450 enzymes. \n \nElimination \n \nGivosiran and its active metabolite are eliminated from plasma primarily by metabolism with an \nestimated terminal half-life of approximately 5 hours. The population estimate for apparent plasma \nclearance was 36.6 L/h for givosiran and 23.4 L/h for AS(N-1)3’ givosiran. After subcutaneous \ndosing, up to 14 % and 13 % of the administered givosiran dose was recovered in urine as givosiran \nand its active metabolite, respectively, over 24 hours. The renal clearance ranged from 1.22 to 9.19 L/h \nfor givosiran and 1.40 to 12.34 L/h for the active metabolite. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nGivosiran and its active metabolite exhibited linear pharmacokinetics in plasma over the 0.35 to \n2.5 mg/kg dose range. At doses greater than 2.5 mg/kg, plasma exposure increased slightly greater \nthan dose-proportionally. Givosiran exhibited time-independent pharmacokinetics with chronic dosing \nat the recommended dose regimen of 2.5 mg/kg once monthly. There was no accumulation of \ngivosiran or the active metabolite in plasma after repeated once monthly dosing. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nPlasma concentrations of givosiran are not reflective of the extent or duration of pharmacodynamic \nactivity. Since givosiran is a liver targeted therapy, concentrations in plasma decline rapidly due to \nuptake by the liver. In the liver, givosiran exhibits a long half-life leading to extended duration of \npharmacodynamic effect maintained over the monthly dosing interval. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo studies have been conducted in patients aged > 65 years. Age was not a significant covariate in the \npharmacokinetics of givosiran. \n \nGender and race \nIn clinical studies there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of givosiran \nbased on gender or race. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAdult patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 1×ULN and AST > 1×ULN, or \nbilirubin > 1×ULN to 1.5×ULN) had comparable plasma exposure of givosiran and its active \nmetabolite and similar pharmacodynamics (percent reduction in urinary ALA and PBG) as patients \nwith normal hepatic function. No studies have been conducted in patients with moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nRenal impairment \nAdult patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), moderate renal \nimpairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) or severe renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 15 to \n< 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) had comparable plasma exposure of givosiran and its active metabolite and \nsimilar pharmacodynamics (percent reduction in urinary ALA and PBG) as patients with normal renal \nfunction (eGFR ≥ to 90 mL/min/1.73 m²). No studies have been conducted in patients with end-stage \nrenal disease or patients with dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nAvailable data suggest that body weight but not age was a significant covariate in the \npharmacokinetics of givosiran. At the 2.5 mg/kg dose, a similar exposure is expected in adolescents \naged 12 years or older, as in adults with the same body weight. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. In the \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and monkeys, the rat was identified as the most sensitive \nspecies to givosiran-related effects, with the liver being identified as the primary target organ of \ntoxicity in both the rat and monkey. No adverse findings were associated with chronic, weekly \nadministration of givosiran to rats and monkeys at doses that achieved exposure multiples of 3.5- and \n26.3-fold, respectively when compared to exposures achieved in patients receiving the maximum \nrecommended human dose. \n \nGenotoxicity/carcinogenicity \n \nGivosiran did not exhibit a genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo. \n \nAnimal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of givosiran. \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nEmbryo-foetal development studies have been performed in rats and rabbits during organogenesis. \nGivosiran showed marked maternal toxicity in rabbits (including mean maternal body weight loss) and \nresulted in increased post-implantation loss as a result of increased early resorptions and a low \nincidence of skeletal variations. These findings are considered an indirect effect, secondary to maternal \ntoxicity. No adverse developmental effects were observed in rats administered the maternally toxic \ndose of approximately 9 times the normalised maximum recommended human dose. \n \nIn a postnatal development study in rats, there was no effect on growth and development of the \noffspring. \n \nNo adverse effects were observed in the fertility of male and female rats when administered with \ngivosiran. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Givlaari is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Givlaari \n3. How Givlaari is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Givlaari \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Givlaari is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Givlaari is \nGivlaari contains the active substance ‘givosiran’. \n \nWhat Givlaari is used for \nGivlaari is used to treat acute hepatic porphyria in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. \n \nWhat acute hepatic porphyria is \nAcute hepatic porphyria is a rare illness that runs in families. It is caused by a defect in one of the \nproteins that make a molecule called haem in the liver. Because there is a problem in one of the \nproteins required to make haem, there is a build-up of some of the substances that are used to produce \nhaem, namely aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). Having too much ALA and \nPBG can injure nerves and cause serious attacks of pain, nausea, muscle weakness and changes in \nmental functioning. Some people with acute hepatic porphyria may also have symptoms, such as pain \nand nausea, in between attacks. Longer-term complications that can be seen in people with acute \nhepatic porphyria include high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and liver disease. \n \nHow Givlaari works \nThis medicine works by lowering the amount of an enzyme, called ALAS1, that controls how much \nALA and PBG are made by the liver. By lowering ALAS1, the liver makes less ALA and PBG. This \ncan help to reduce the effects of this illness. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Givlaari \n \nYou must not be given Givlaari: \n• if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to givosiran or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given this medicine. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nSevere allergic reaction \n• Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any signs of a severe allergic reaction. The \n\nsigns are listed in “Serious side effects” in section 4. \n• If you have a severe allergic reaction, your doctor or nurse will stop using the medicine straight \n\naway and you may need to take other medicines to control the symptoms. \n \nLiver problems \nUsing this medicine can affect your liver. You will have blood tests to check your liver function before \nyou start treatment with Givlaari and periodically during treatment. If these tests show abnormal \nresults, your doctor or nurse will decide whether to interrupt treatment or stop treatment permanently. \nAbnormal results have been seen in some patients treated with this medicine, mainly between 3 to \n5 months after starting treatment. \n \nKidney problems \nUsing this medicine can affect your kidneys, especially if you have already been diagnosed with \nkidney problems. Your doctor will check how your kidneys are working while you are using this \nmedicine, especially if you already have kidney problems. \n \nChildren \nThis medicine should not be used in children below 12 years of age because there is no experience of \nusing the medicine in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Givlaari \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might be using any other \nmedicines. \n \nWhen using certain medicines, this medicine may prolong or increase their effect or change their side \neffects. \n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \nnurse for advice before using this medicine. \n \nBreast-feeding \nStudies in animals suggest this medicine may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding ask your \ndoctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop \nbreast-feeding or to stop treatment with Givlaari taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for \nyour child and benefit of therapy for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine is unlikely to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nGivlaari contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How Givlaari is given \n \nHow much Givlaari is given \nYour doctor will work out how much medicine to give you. The amount will depend on your body \nweight. \n• The recommended dose is 2.5 milligrams for every kilogram you weigh \n• You will be given the medicine once a month (every 4 weeks) \n• If blood tests show problems with your liver, your doctor may interrupt Givlaari treatment or \n\nstop treatment permanently. Your doctor may consider starting again at a lower dose. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nHow Givlaari is given \nThis medicine will be given to you once every month by a doctor or nurse. It is given as an injection \nunder the skin (subcutaneously) into your stomach area (abdomen), or in some cases, your upper arm \nor thigh. The site of the injection will be rotated. If the dose is more than 1 mL, more than one vial will \nneed to be used and more than one subcutaneous injection may need to be given. \n \nIf you are given too much Givlaari \nIn the unlikely event that your doctor or nurse gives you too much (an overdose) they will check you \nfor side effects. \n \nIf you miss your dose of Givlaari \nIf you have missed an appointment for your injection, talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \nSevere allergic reactions (uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the following signs of a severe allergic \nreaction (anaphylactic reaction) – the injection will need to be stopped and you may need to take other \nmedicines to manage the reaction: \n• swelling – mainly of the lips, tongue or throat which makes it difficult to swallow or breathe \n• breathing problems or wheezing \n• feeling dizzy or fainting \n• rash, hives \n• itching \n \nOther side effects \nTell your doctor or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• Nausea \n• Redness, pain, itching or swelling at the site of the injection (injection site reaction) \n• Skin rashes including red, itchy or dry skin, eczema or hives \n• Feeling tired \n• Blood tests showing an increase in transaminases, which are liver enzymes (a sign of possible \n\nliver inflammation) \n• Blood tests showing an increase in creatinine, a substance removed from your body by your \n\nkidneys, or decrease in glomerular filtration rate (signs of possible kidney problems) \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n• A type of allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) – with symptoms such as hives, rash, swelling of \n\neyes, mouth or face, difficulty breathing, itching. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24 \n\n5.

If the \ndose is more than 1 mL, more than one vial will need to be used and more than one \nsubcutaneous injection may need to be given. The maximum acceptable single injection volume \nto be administered is 1.5 mL. \n\n• To withdraw Givlaari, hold the vial upright or tilt at a slight angle and ensure the flat edge of the \nneedle is pointed downwards. \n\n• Draw up the indicated injection volume with the 21 G or larger needle. \n• Divide doses requiring volumes greater than 1.5 mL equally into multiple syringes, with each \n\ninjection containing approximately the same volume. \n• Point the needle and syringe straight up and tap the syringe to move any bubbles to the top. \n\nOnce the bubbles are at the top, gently push the plunger to force the bubbles out of the syringe. \nCheck to make sure you still have the correct amount of medicine in the syringe. \n\n• Once the dose is prepared and in the administration syringe, replace the 21 G or larger needle \nwith either a 25 G or 27 G needle. \n\n• Note: Do not push this medicine into the 25 G or 27 G needle. \n• Injection can be into the abdomen, or if required, the back or side of the upper arms, or the \n\nthighs. Consider rotating injection sites. Do not administer into scar tissue or areas that are \nreddened, inflamed, or swollen. \n\n• Note: When administering subcutaneous injections into the abdomen, a 5.0 cm diameter circle \naround the navel should be avoided. \n\n• Clean the area you intend to inject with an alcohol swab and wait for the area to dry completely. \n• Ensure proper injection technique. Do not inject into a vein or muscle. \n• Pinch and elevate the skin at the selected injection site. Insert the needle at a right angle (90 \n\ndegrees) to deliver the injection just below the skin. In patients with little subcutaneous tissue or \nif the needle size is longer than 2.5 cm, the needle should be inserted at a 45-degree angle. \n\n• Do not press down on the plunger while piercing the skin. Once the needle is inserted through \nthe skin, release the pinched skin and administer the dose in a slow and steady manner. Once \nthis medicine has been administered count for at least 5 seconds before withdrawing the needle \nfrom the skin. Lightly press gauze or cotton ball on the injection site as needed. Do not put the \nneedle cap back on. \n\n• Note: Don’t aspirate after inserting the needle to prevent tissue damage, haematoma and \nbruising. \n\n• If more than one injection is needed for a single dose of Givlaari, the injection sites should be at \nleast 2 cm apart from previous injection locations. \n\n• Only use the vial once. After you inject the dose, dispose of any unused medicine in the vial \naccording to local regulations. \n\n• Use the syringes, transfer needles and injection needles only once. Dispose of any used syringes \nand needles in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.
