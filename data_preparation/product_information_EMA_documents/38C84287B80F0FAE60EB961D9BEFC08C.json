CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFycompa (perampanel) is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of  \n- partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalised seizures in patients from \n4 years of age and older. \n- primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients from 7 years of age and older with \nidiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nFycompa must be titrated, according to individual patient response, in order to optimise the balance \nbetween efficacy and tolerability. \nPerampanel should be taken orally once daily at bedtime. \nThe physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and \ndose.  Alternate formulations of perampanel are available, including oral suspension \n \nPartial-Onset Seizures \nPerampanel at doses of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day has been shown to be effective therapy in partial-onset \nseizures. \n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology for adults, adolescents and children from \n4 years of age. More details are provided below the table. \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n Adult/adolescent \n(12 years and older) \n\nChildren (4 – 11 years); weighing: \n≥ 30 kg 20 - < 30 kg < 20 kg \n\nRecommended \nstarting dose 2 mg/day 2 mg/day 1 mg/day 1 mg/day \n\nTitration \n(incremental \nsteps) \n\n2 mg/day \n(no more frequently \nthan weekly \nintervals) \n\n2 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly intervals) \n\n1 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly intervals) \n\n1 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly \nintervals) \n\nRecommended \nmaintenance dose 4 – 8 mg/day 4 – 8 mg/day 4 – 6 mg/day 2 – 4 mg/day \n\nTitration \n(incremental \nsteps) \n\n2 mg/day \n(no more frequently \nthan weekly \nintervals) \n\n2 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly intervals) \n\n1 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly intervals) \n\n0.5 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly \nintervals) \n\nRecommended \nmaximum dose 12 mg/day 12 mg/day 8 mg/day 6 mg/day \n\n \nAdults, adolescents age ≥ 12 years \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day.

Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal \nproducts that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more \nfrequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that \nshorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at \n1-week intervals. \n \nChildren (from 4 to 11 years) weighing ≥ 30 kg \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day. The dose may be increased \nbased on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 2 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as \nper half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 8 mg/day. \nDepending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 8 mg/day, the dose may be \nincreased by increments of 2 mg/day to 12 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal \nproducts that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more \nfrequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that \nshorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at \n1-week intervals. \n \nChildren (from 4 to 11 years of age) weighing 20 kg and < 30 kg \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 1 mg/day. The dose may be increased \nbased on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 1 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as \nper half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 6 mg/day.  \nDepending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 6 mg/day, the dose may be \nincreased by increments of 1 mg/day to 8 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal \nproducts that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more \nfrequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that \nshorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at \n1-week intervals. \n \nChildren (from 4 to 11 years of age) weighing < 20 kg \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 1 mg/day. The dose may be increased \nbased on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 1 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nper half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 2 mg/day to 4 mg/day. \nDepending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 4 mg/day, the dose may be \nincreased by increments of 0.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal \nproducts that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more \nfrequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that \nshorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at \n1-week intervals. \n \nPrimary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures \nPerampanel at a dose up to 8 mg/day has been shown to be effective in primary generalised \ntonic-clonic seizures. \n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology for adults, adolescents and children from \n7 years of age. More details are provided below the table. \n \n\n Adult/adolescent \n(12 years and older) \n\nChildren (7 – 11 years); weighing: \n≥ 30 kg 20 - < 30 kg < 20 kg \n\nRecommended \nstarting dose 2 mg/day 2 mg/day 1 mg/day 1 mg/day \n\nTitration \n(incremental \nsteps) \n\n2 mg/day \n(no more frequently \nthan weekly \nintervals) \n\n2 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly intervals) \n\n1 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly intervals) \n\n1 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly \nintervals) \n\nRecommended \nmaintenance dose Up to 8 mg/day 4 – 8 mg/day 4 – 6 mg/day 2 – 4 mg/day \n\nTitration \n(incremental \nsteps) \n\n2 mg/day \n(no more frequently \nthan weekly \nintervals) \n\n2 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly intervals) \n\n1 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly intervals) \n\n0.5 mg/day \n(no more \nfrequently than \nweekly \nintervals) \n\nRecommended \nmaximum dose 12 mg/day 12 mg/day 8 mg/day 6 mg/day \n\n \nAdults, adolescents age ≥ 12 years \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated at a dose of 2 mg/day. The dose may be increased based \non clinical response and tolerability by increments of 2 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks, as per \nhalf-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of up to 8 mg/day. Depending upon \nindividual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 8 mg/day, the dose may be increased up to \n12 mg/day, which may be effective in some patients (see section 4.4). Patients who are taking \nconcomitant medicinal products that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should \nbe titrated no more frequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal \nproducts that shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently \nthan at 1-week intervals. \n \nChildren (from 7 to 11 years) weighing ≥ 30 kg \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day. The dose may be increased \nbased on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 2 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as \nper half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 8 mg/day. \nDepending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 8 mg/day, the dose may be \nincreased by increments of 2 mg/day to 12 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal \nproducts that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more \nfrequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that \nshorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at \n1-week intervals. \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n \nChildren (from 7 to 11 years of age) weighing 20 kg and < 30 kg \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 1 mg/day. The dose may be increased \nbased on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 1 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as \nper half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 6 mg/day.  \nDepending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 6 mg/day, the dose may be \nincreased by increments of 1 mg/day to 8 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal \nproducts that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more \nfrequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that \nshorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at \n1-week intervals. \n \nChildren (from 7 to 11 years of age) weighing < 20 kg \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 1 mg/day. The dose may be increased \nbased on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 1 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as \nper half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 2 mg/day to 4 mg/day. \nDepending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 4 mg/day, the dose may be \nincreased by increments of 0.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal \nproducts that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more \nfrequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that \nshorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at \n1-week intervals. \n \nWithdrawal \nIt is recommended that discontinuation be undertaken gradually to minimise the potential for rebound \nseizures. However, due to its long half-life and subsequent slow decline in plasma concentrations, \nperampanel can be discontinued abruptly if absolutely needed. \n \nMissed doses \nSingle missed dose: As perampanel has a long half-life, the patient should wait and take their next \ndose as scheduled. \n \nIf more than 1 dose has been missed, for a continuous period of less than 5 half-lives (3 weeks for \npatients not taking perampanel metabolism-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (AED), 1 week for patients \ntaking perampanel metabolism-inducing AEDs (see section 4.5)), consideration should be given to \nre-start treatment from the last dose level. \n \nIf a patient has discontinued perampanel for a continuous period of more than 5 half-lives, it is \nrecommended that initial dosing recommendations given above should be followed. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nClinical studies of Fycompa in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and \nover to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Analysis of safety \ninformation in 905 perampanel-treated elderly patients (in double-blind studies conducted in \nnon-epilepsy indications) revealed no age-related differences in the safety profile. In combination with \nthe lack of age-related difference in perampanel exposure, the results indicate that dose-adjustment in \nthe elderly is not required. Perampanel should be used with caution in elderly taking into account the \ndrug interaction potential in polymedicated patients (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nDose adjustment is not required in patients with mild renal impairment. Use in patients with moderate \nor severe renal impairment or patients undergoing haemodialysis is not recommended. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDose increases in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be based on clinical \nresponse and tolerability. For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, dosing can be \n\n\n\n 7 \n\ninitiated at 2 mg. Patients should be up-titrated using 2 mg doses no faster than every 2 weeks based \non tolerability and effectiveness. \nPerampanel dosing for patients with mild and moderate impairment should not exceed 8 mg. \nUse in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of perampanel have not yet been established  in children below 4 years of age \nin the POS indication or in children below 7 years of age in the PGTCS indication. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFycompa should be taken as single oral dose at bedtime. It may be taken with or without food (see \nsection 5.2). The tablet should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. It should not be chewed, \ncrushed or split. The tablets cannot be split accurately as there is no break line. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicinal \nproducts in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of \nanti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for perampanel. \nTherefore, patients (children, adolescents, and adults) should be monitored for signs of suicidal \nideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of \npatients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour \nemerge. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms (DRESS) and Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, \nhave been reported (frequency unknown; see section 4.8) in association with perampanel treatment. \n \nAt the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored \nclosely for skin reactions. \n \nSymptoms of DRESS include typically, although not exclusively, fever, rash associated with other \norgan system involvement, lymphadenopathy, liver function tests abnormalities and eosinophilia. It is \nimportant to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may \nbe present even though rash is not evident. \n \nSymptoms of SJS include typically although not exclusively, skin detachment (epidermal \nnecrosis/blister) < 10%, erythematous skin (confluent), rapid progression, painful atypical target-like \nlesions and/or purpuric macules in wide dissemination or large erythema (confluent), bullous/erosive \ninvolvement of more than 2 mucous membranes. \n \nIf signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, perampanel should be withdrawn \nimmediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nIf the patient has developed a serious reaction such as SJS or DRESS with the use of perampanel, \ntreatment with perampanel must not be restarted in this patient at any time. \n \nAbsence and myoclonic seizures \n \nAbsence and myoclonic seizures are two common generalised seizure types that frequently occur in \nIGE patients. Other AEDs are known to induce or aggravate these seizure types. Patients with \nmyoclonic seizures and absence seizures should be monitored while on Fycompa. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nPerampanel may cause dizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see section 4.7). \n \nHormonal contraceptives \n \nAt doses of 12 mg/day Fycompa may decrease the effectiveness of progestative-containing hormonal \ncontraceptives; in this circumstance additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended \nwhen using Fycompa (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \n \nFalls \n \nThere appears to be an increased risk of falls, particularly in the elderly; the underlying reason is \nunclear. \n \nAggression \n \nAggressive and hostile behaviour has been reported in patients receiving perampanel therapy. In \nperampanel-treated patients in clinical trials, aggression, anger and irritability were reported more \nfrequently at higher doses. Most of the reported events were either mild or moderate and patients \nrecovered either spontaneously or with dose adjustment. However, thoughts of harming others, \nphysical assault or threatening behaviour were observed in some patients (<1% in perampanel clinical \nstudies). Homicidal ideation has been reported in patients. Patients and caregivers should be \ncounselled to alert a healthcare professional immediately if significant changes in mood or patterns of \nbehaviour are noted. The dosage of perampanel should be reduced if such symptoms occur and should \nbe discontinued immediately if symptoms are severe. \n \nAbuse potential \n \nCaution should be exercised in patients with a history of substance abuse and the patient should be \nmonitored for symptoms of perampanel abuse. \n \nConcomitant CYP 3A inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products \n \nResponse rates after addition of perampanel at fixed doses were less when patients received \nconcomitant CYP3A enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products (carbamazepine, phenytoin, \noxcarbazepine) as compared to response rates in patient who received concomitant \nnon-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products. Patients’ response should be monitored when \nthey are switching from concomitant non-inducer anti-epileptic medicinal products to enzyme \ninducing medicinal products and vice versa. Depending upon individual clinical response and \ntolerability, the dose may be increased or decreased 2 mg at a time (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nOther concomitant (non- anti-epileptic) cytochrome P450 inducing or inhibiting medicinal products \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for tolerability and clinical response when adding or removing \ncytochrome P450 inducers or inhibitors, since perampanel plasma levels can be decreased or \nincreased; the dose of perampanel may need to be adjusted accordingly. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nCases of hepatotoxicity (mainly hepatic enzyme increased) with perampanel in combination with other \nantiepileptic drugs have been reported. If hepatic enzymes elevation is observed, monitoring of liver \nfunction should be considered. \n \nExcipients \n \nLactose intolerance \nFycompa tablets contains lactose, therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFycompa is not considered a strong inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 or UGT enzymes (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHormonal contraceptives \n \nIn healthy women receiving 12 mg (but not 4 or 8 mg/day) for 21 days concomitantly with a combined \noral contraceptive, Fycompa was shown to decrease the levonorgestrel exposure (mean Cmax and AUC \nvalues were each decreased by 40%). Ethinylestradiol AUC was not affected by Fycompa 12 mg \nwhereas Cmax was decreased by 18%. Therefore, the possibility of decreased efficacy of hormonal \nprogestative-containing contraceptives should be considered for women needing Fycompa 12 mg/day \nand an additional reliable method (intra-uterine device (IUD), condom) is to be used (see section 4.4). \n \nInteractions between Fycompa and other anti-epileptic medicinal products \n \nPotential interactions between Fycompa and other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were assessed in \nclinical studies. A population PK analysis of three pooled Phase 3 studies in adolescent and adult \npatients with partial-onset seizures evaluated the effect of Fycompa (up to 12 mg once daily) on the \nPK of other AEDs. In another population PK analysis of pooled data from twenty Phase 1 studies in \nhealthy subjects, with Fycompa up to 36 mg, and one Phase 2 and six Phase 3 studies in paediatric, \nadolescent, and adult patients with partial-onset seizures or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, \nwith Fycompa up to 16 mg once daily, evaluated the effect of concomitant AEDs of perampanel \nclearance. The effect of these interactions on average steady state concentration is summarised in the \nfollowing table. \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nAED \ncoadministered \n\nInfluence of AED on Fycompa \nconcentration \n\nInfluence of Fycompa on AED \nconcentration \n\nCarbamazepine 3 fold decrease <10% decrease \nClobazam No influence <10% decrease \nClonazepam No influence No influence \nLamotrigine No influence <10% decrease \nLevetiracetam No influence No influence \nOxcarbazepine 2 fold decrease 35% increase 1) \nPhenobarbital 20% decrease No influence \nPhenytoin 2 fold decrease No influence \nTopiramate 20% decrease No influence \nValproic Acid No influence <10% decrease \nZonisamide No influence No influence \n\n1) Active metabolite monohydroxycarbazepine was not assessed. \n \nBased on the results from the population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset \nseizures and patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures the total clearance of Fycompa \nwas increased when co-administered with carbamazepine (3-fold), and phenytoin or  oxcarbazepine \n(2-fold), which are known inducers of enzymes of metabolism (see section 5.2). This effect should be \ntaken into account and managed when adding or withdrawing these anti-epileptic drugs from a \npatient’s treatment regimen. Clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, topiramate, zonisamide, \nclobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid did not affect to a clinically relevant manner the clearance of \nFycompa. \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures, Fycompa did not \naffect to a clinically relevant manner the clearance of clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, \nphenytoin, topiramate, zonisamide, carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid, at the \nhighest perampanel dose evaluated (12 mg/day). \n \nPerampanel was found to decrease the clearance of oxcarbazepine by 26%. Oxcarbazepine is rapidly \nmetabolised by cytosolic reductase enzyme to the active metabolite, monohydroxycarbazepine. The \neffect of perampanel on monohydroxycarbazepine concentrations is not known. \n \nPerampanel is dosed to clinical effect regardless of other AEDs. \n \nEffect of perampanel on CYP3A substrates \n \nIn healthy subjects, Fycompa (6 mg once daily for 20 days) decreased midazolam AUC by 13%. A \nlarger decrease in exposure of midazolam (or other sensitive CYP3A substrates) at higher Fycompa \ndoses cannot be excluded. \n \nEffect of cytochrome P450 inducers on perampanel pharmacokinetics \n \nStrong inducers of cytochrome P450, such as rifampicin and hypericum, are expected to decrease \nperampanel concentrations and the potential for higher plasma concentrations of reactive metabolites \nin their presence has not been excluded. Felbamate has been shown to decrease the concentrations of \nsome medicinal products and may also reduce perampanel concentrations. \n \nEffect of cytochrome P450 inhibitors on perampanel pharmacokinetics \n \nIn healthy subjects, the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 10 days) increased \nperampanel AUC by 20% and prolonged perampanel half--life by 15% (67.8 h vs 58.4 h). Larger \neffects cannot be excluded when perampanel is combined with a CYP3A inhibitor with longer half-life \nthan ketoconazole or when the inhibitor is given for a longer treatment duration. \n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nLevodopa \nIn healthy subjects, Fycompa (4 mg once daily for 19 days) had no effect on Cmax or AUC of levodopa. \n \nAlcohol \n \nThe effects of perampanel on tasks involving alertness and vigilance such as driving ability were \nadditive or supra-additive to the effects of alcohol itself, as found in a pharmacodynamic interaction \nstudy in healthy subjects. Multiple dosing of perampanel 12 mg/day increased levels of anger, \nconfusion, and depression as assessed using the Profile of Mood State 5-point rating scale (see \nsection 5.1). These effects may also be seen when Fycompa is used in combination with other central \nnervous system (CNS) depressants. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of  adolescent patients age ≥ 12 years and children age 4 to \n11 years, there were no notable differences compared to the adult population. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential and contraception in males and females \n \nFycompa is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless \nclearly necessary. Fycompa may decrease the effectiveness of progestative-containing hormonal \ncontraceptives. An additional non-hormonal form of contraception is, therefore recommended (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amounts of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of perampanel in \npregnant women. Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but \nembryotoxicity was observed in rats at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). Fycompa is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nStudies in lactating rats have shown excretion of perampanel and/or its metabolites in milk (for details \nsee section 5.3). It is not known whether perampanel is excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from Fycompa therapy taking into account the benefit of breast--feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nIn the fertility study in rats, prolonged and irregular oestrous cycles were observed at high-dose \n(30 mg/kg) in females; however, these changes did not affect the fertility and early embryonic \ndevelopment. There were no effects on male fertility (see section 5.3). The effect of perampanel on \nhuman fertility has not been established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFycompa has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPerampanel may cause dizziness and somnolence and, therefore, may influence the ability to drive or \nuse machines. Patients are advised not to drive a vehicle, operate complex machinery or engage in \nother potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether perampanel affects their ability to \nperform these tasks (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn all controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with partial-onset seizures, 1,639 patients have \nreceived perampanel of whom 1,147 have been treated for 6 months and 703 for longer than \n12 months. \n \nIn the controlled and uncontrolled study in patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, \n114 patients have received perampanel of whom 68 have been treated for 6 months and 36 for longer \nthan 12 months. \n \nAdverse reactions leading to discontinuation: \nIn the controlled Phase 3 partial-onset seizures clinical trials, the rate of discontinuation as a result of \nan adverse reaction was 1.7% (3/172), 4.2% (18/431) and 13.7% (35/255) in patients randomised to \nreceive perampanel at the recommended doses of 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg/day, respectively, and \n1.4% (6/442) in patients randomised to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly (≥ 1% \nin the total perampanel group and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness and \nsomnolence. \n \nIn the controlled Phase 3 primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures clinical trial, the rate of \ndiscontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 4.9% (4/81) in patients randomised to receive \nperampanel 8 mg, and 1.2% (1/82) in patients randomised to receive placebo. The adverse reaction \nmost commonly leading to discontinuation (≥ 2% in the perampanel group and greater than placebo) \nwas dizziness. \n \nPost-marketing use \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms (DRESS) have been reported in association with perampanel treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below, adverse reactions, which were identified based on review of the full Fycompa \nclinical studies safety database, are listed by System Organ Class and frequency. The following \nconvention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nWithin each frequency category, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Decreased appetite \nIncreased appetite \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Aggression \nAnger \nAnxiety \nConfusional state \n\nSuicidal \nideation \nSuicide attempt \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness \nSomnolence \n\nAtaxia \nDysarthria \nBalance disorder \nIrritability \n\n  \n\nEye disorders  Diplopia \nVision blurred \n\n  \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n   Drug Reaction \nwith \nEosinophilia and \nSystemic \nSymptoms \n(DRESS)* \nStevens - Johnso\nn Syndrome \n(SJS)* \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Back pain   \n\nGeneral disorders  Gait disturbance \nFatigue \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Weight increased   \nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Fall   \n\n* See section 4.4 \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents exposed to perampanel from double-blind \nstudies for partial-onset seizures and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, the overall safety \nprofile in adolescents was similar to that of adults, except for aggression, which was observed more \nfrequently in adolescents than in adults. \n \nBased on the clinical trial database of 180 paediatric patients exposed to perampanel from a \nmulticentre, open label study, the overall safety profile in children was similar to that established for \nadolescents and adults, except for somnolence, irritability, aggression, and agitation which were \nobserved more frequently in the paediatric study compared to studies in adolescents and adults. \n \nAvailable data in children did not suggest any clinically significant effects of perampanel on growth \nand development parameters including body weight, height, thyroid function, insulin-like growth \nfactor-1 (IGF-1) level, cognition (as assessed by Aldenkamp-Baker neuropsychological assessment \nschedule [ABNAS]), behaviour (as assessed by Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]), and dexterity (as \nassessed by Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test [LGPT]). However, long term effects [greater than \n1 year] on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, and puberty in children remain unknown. \n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with perampanel overdose in humans. In a report of an intentional \noverdose that could have resulted in a dose up to 264 mg, the patient experienced events of altered \nmental status, agitation and aggressive behaviour and recovered without sequelae. There is no \navailable specific antidote to the effects of perampanel. General supportive care of the patient is \nindicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. In \nview of its long half-life, the effects caused by perampanel could be prolonged. Because of low renal \nclearance special interventions such as forced diuresis, dialysis or haemoperfusion are unlikely to be of \nvalue. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX22 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPerampanel is a first-in-class selective, non-competitive antagonist of the ionotropic α-amino-3-\nhydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor on post-synaptic neurons. \nGlutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is implicated in \na number of neurological disorders caused by neuronal overexcitation. Activation of AMPA receptors \nby glutamate is thought to be responsible for most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. In \nin vitro studies, perampanel did not compete with AMPA for binding to the AMPA receptor, but \nperampanel binding was displaced by noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists, indicating that \nperampanel is a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist. In vitro, perampanel inhibited \nAMPA-induced (but not NMDA-induced) increase in intracellular calcium. In vivo, perampanel \nsignificantly prolonged seizure latency in an AMPA-induced seizure model. \n \nThe precise mechanism by which perampanel exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be \nfully elucidated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nA pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data \nfrom the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. In addition, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic \n(efficacy) analysis was performed in one efficacy trial for primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. In \nboth analyses, perampanel exposure is correlated with reduction in seizure frequency. \n \nPsychomotor performance \nSingle and multiple doses of 8 mg and 12 mg impaired psychomotor performance in healthy \nvolunteers in a dose-related manner. The effects of perampanel on complex tasks such as driving \nability were additive or supra-additive to the impairment effects of alcohol. Psychomotor performance \ntesting returned to baseline within 2 weeks of cessation of perampanel dosing. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 15 \n\nCognitive function \nIn a healthy volunteer study to assess the effects of perampanel on alertness, and memory using a \nstandard battery of assessments, no effects of perampanel were found following single and multiple \ndoses of perampanel up to 12 mg/day. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled study conducted in adolescent patients, no significant changes in cognition \nrelative to placebo as measured by Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition Score \nwere observed for perampanel. In the open label extension, no significant changes were observed in \nglobal CDR system score after 52 weeks of perampanel treatment (see section 5.1 Paediatric \npopulation). \n \nIn an open-label uncontrolled study conducted in paediatric patients, no clinically important changes \nin cognition relative to baseline as measured by ABNAS were observed following adjunctive \nperampanel therapy (see section 5.1 Paediatric population). \n \nAlertness and mood \nLevels of alertness (arousal) decreased in a dose-related manner in healthy subjects dosed with \nperampanel from 4 to 12 mg/day. Mood deteriorated following dosing of 12 mg/day only; the changes \nin mood were small and reflected a general lowering of alertness. Multiple dosing of perampanel \n12 mg/day also enhanced the effects of alcohol on vigilance and alertness, and increased levels of \nanger, confusion and depression as assessed using the Profile of Mood State 5-point rating scale. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nPerampanel did not prolong the QTc interval when administered in daily doses up to 12 mg/day, and \ndid not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPartial-Onset Seizures \nThe efficacy of perampanel in partial-onset seizures was established in three adjunctive therapy \n19 week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials in adult and adolescent \npatients. Patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation and were not \nadequately controlled with one to three concomitant AEDs. During a 6-week baseline period, patients \nwere required to have more than five seizures with no seizure-free period exceeding 25 days. In these \nthree trials, patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 21.06 years. Between 85.3% \nand 89.1% of patients were taking two to three concomitant AEDs with or without concurrent vagal \nnerve stimulation. \n \nTwo studies (studies 304 and 305) compared doses of perampanel 8 and 12 mg/day with placebo and \nthe third study (study 306) compared doses of perampanel 2, 4 and 8 mg/day with placebo. In all three \ntrials, following a 6-week Baseline Phase to establish baseline seizure frequency prior to \nrandomisation, patients were randomised and titrated to the randomised dose. During the Titration \nPhase in all three trials, treatment was initiated at 2 mg/day and increased in weekly increments of \n2 mg/day to the target dose. Patients experiencing intolerable adverse events could remain on the same \ndose or have their dose decreased to the previously tolerated dose. In all three trials, the Titration \nPhase was followed by a Maintenance Phase that lasted 13 weeks, during which patients were to \nremain on a stable dose of perampanel. \n \nThe pooled 50% responder rates were placebo 19%, 4 mg 29%, 8 mg 35% and 12 mg 35%. A \nstatistically significant effect on the reduction in 28-day seizure frequency (Baseline to Treatment \nPhase) as compared to the placebo group was observed with perampanel treatment at doses of \n4 mg/day (Study 306), 8 mg/day (Studies 304, 305 and 306), and 12 mg/day (Studies 304 and 305). \nThe 50% responder rates in the 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg groups were respectively 23.0%, 31.5%, and \n30.0% in combination with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products and were 33.3%, \n46.5% and 50.0% when perampanel was given in combination with non-enzyme-inducing \nanti-epileptic medicinal products. These studies show that once-daily administration of perampanel at \n\n\n\n 16 \n\ndoses of 4 mg to 12 mg was significantly more efficacious than placebo as adjunctive treatment in this \npopulation. \n \nData from placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that improvement in seizure control is observed \nwith a once-daily perampanel dose of 4 mg and this benefit is enhanced as the dose is increased to \n8 mg/day. No efficacy benefit was observed at the dose of 12 mg as compared to the dose of 8 mg in \nthe overall population. Benefit at the dose of 12 mg was observed in some patients who tolerate the \ndose of 8 mg and when the clinical response to that dose was insufficient. A clinically meaningful \nreduction in seizure frequency relative to placebo was achieved as early as the second week of dosing \nwhen patients reached a daily dose of 4 mg. \n \n1.7 to 5.8% of the patients on perampanel in the clinical studies became seizure free during the \n3 month maintenance period compared with 0%-1.0% on placebo \n \nOpen label extension study \nNinety-seven percent of the patients who completed the randomised trials in patients with partial-onset \nseizures were enrolled in the open label extension study (n = 1186). Patients from the randomised trial \nwere converted to perampanel over 16 weeks followed by a long-term maintenance period (≥ 1 year). \nThe mean average daily dose was 10.05 mg. \n \nPrimary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures \nPerampanel as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with idiopathic generalised \nepilepsy experiencing primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures was established in a multicentre, \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 332). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 \nto 3 AEDs experiencing at least 3 primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures during the 8-week baseline \nperiod were randomised to either perampanel or placebo. The population included 164 patients \n(perampanel N = 82, placebo N = 82). Patients were titrated over four weeks to a target dose of 8 mg \nper day or the highest tolerated dose and treated for an additional 13 weeks on the last dose level \nachieved at the end of the titration period. The total treatment period was 17 weeks. Study drug was \ngiven once per day. \n \nThe 50% primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures responder rate during the Maintenance Period was \nsignificantly higher in the perampanel group (58.0%) than in the placebo group (35.8%), P = 0.0059. \nThe 50% responder rate was 22.2% in combination with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal \nproducts and was 69.4% when perampanel was given in combination with non-enzyme-inducing \nanti-epileptic medicinal products. The number of perampanel patients taking enzyme-inducing \nanti-epileptic medicinal products was small (n = 9). The median percent change in primary generalised \ntonic-clonic seizure frequency per 28 days during the Titration and Maintenance Periods (combined) \nrelative to Prerandomisation was greater with perampanel (-76.5%) than with placebo (-38.4%), \nP < 0.0001. During the 3 months maintenance period, 30.9% (25/81) of the patients on perampanel in \nthe clinical studies became free of PGTC seizures compared with 12.3% (10/81) on placebo. \n \nOther subtypes of idiopathic generalised seizure \nThe efficacy and safety of perampanel in patients with myoclonic seizures have not been established. \nThe available data are insufficient to reach any conclusions. \nThe efficacy of perampanel in the treatment of absence seizures has not been demonstrated. \nIn Study 332, in patients with PGTC seizures who also had concomitant myoclonic seizures, freedom \nfrom seizures was achieved in 16.7% (4/24) on perampanel compared to 13.0% (3/23) in those on \nplacebo. In patients with concomitant absence seizures, freedom from seizures was achieved in 22.2% \n(6/27) on perampanel compared to 12.1% (4/33) on placebo. Freedom from all seizures was achieved \nin 23.5% (19/81) of patients on perampanel compared to 4.9% (4/81) of patients on placebo. \n \nOpen label extension phase \nOf the 140 patients who completed the Study 332, 114 patients (81.4%) had entered the Extension \nphase. Patients from the randomised trial were converted to perampanel over 6 weeks followed by a \nlong-term maintenance period (≥ 1 year). In the Extension Phase, 73.7% (84/114) of patients have a \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nmodal daily perampanel dose of greater than 4 to 8 mg/day and 16.7% (19/114) had a modal daily \ndose of greater than 8 to 12 mg/day. A decrease in PGTC seizure frequency of at least 50% was seen \nin 65.9% (29/44) of patients after 1 year of treatment during the Extension Phase (relative to their \npre-perampanel baseline seizure frequency). These data were consistent with those for percent change \nin seizure frequency and showed that the PGTC 50% responder rate was generally stable across time \nfrom about week 26 through the end of year 2. Similar results were seen when all seizures and absence \nvs. myoclonic seizures were evaluated over time. \n \nConversion to monotherapy \nIn a retrospective study of clinical practice, 51 patients with epilepsy who received perampanel as \nadjunctive treatment converted to perampanel monotherapy. The majority of these patients had a \nhistory of partial onset seizures. Of these, 14 patients (27%) reverted to adjunctive therapy in the \nfollowing months. Thirty four (34) patients were followed up for at least 6 months and, of these, \n24 patients (71%) remained on perampanel monotherapy for at least 6 months. Ten (10) patients were \nfollowed up for at least 18 months and, of these, 3 patients (30%) remained on perampanel \nmonotherapy for at least 18 months. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFycompa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment-resistant epilepsies \n(localisation-related and age-related epilepsy syndromes) (see section 4.2 for information on \nadolescent and paediatric use). \n \nThe three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 studies included 143 adolescents between \nthe ages of 12 and 18. The results in these adolescents were similar to those seen in the adult \npopulation. \n \nStudy 332 included 22 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18. The results in these adolescents \nwere similar to those seen in the adult population. \n \nA 19-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label extension phase \n(Study 235) was performed to assess the short-term effects on cognition of Fycompa (target dose range \nof 8 to 12 mg once daily) as adjunctive therapy in 133 (Fycompa n = 85, placebo n = 48) adolescent \npatients, aged 12 to less than 18 years old, with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. \nCognitive function was assessed by the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition \nt-Score, which is a composite score derived from 5 domains testing Power of Attention, Continuity of \nAttention, Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory, Quality of Working Memory, and Speed of \nMemory. The mean change (SD) from baseline to end of double-blind treatment (19 weeks) in CDR \nSystem Global Cognition t-Score was 1.1 (7.14) in the placebo group and (minus) –1.0 (8.86) in the \nperampanel group, with the difference between the treatment groups in LS means \n(95% CI) = (minus) -2.2 (-5.2, 0.8). There was no statistically significant difference between the \ntreatment groups (p = 0.145). CDR System Global Cognition t-Scores for placebo and perampanel \nwere 41.2 (10.7) and 40.8 (13.0), respectively at the baseline. For patients with perampanel in the open \nlabel extension (n = 112), the mean change (SD) from baseline to end of open-label treatment \n(52 weeks) in CDR System Global Cognition t-Score was (minus) -1.0 (9.91). This was not \nstatistically significant (p = 0.96). After up to 52 weeks of treatment with perampanel (n = 114), no \neffect on bone growth was observed. No effects on weight, height and sexual development were seen \nfollowing up to 104 weeks of treatment (n = 114). \n \nAn open-label, uncontrolled study (Study 311) was performed to assess the exposure-efficacy \nrelationship of perampanel as adjunctive therapy in 180 paediatric patients (aged 4 to 11 years old) \nwith inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. \nPatients were titrated over 11 weeks to a target dose of 8 mg/day or the maximum tolerated dose (not \nto exceed 12 mg/day) for patients not taking concomitant CYP3A-inducing antiepileptic drugs \n(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine and phenytoin) or 12 mg/day or the maximum \n\n\n\n 18 \n\ntolerated dose (not to exceed 16 mg/day) for patients taking a concomitant CYP3A-inducing \nantiepileptic drug.  Perampanel dose achieved at the end of titration was maintained for 12 weeks (for \na total of 23 weeks of exposure) at the completion of the core study. Patients who entered into \nExtension Phase were treated for an additional 29 weeks for a total exposure duration of 52 weeks. \n \nIn patients with partial-onset seizures (n = 148 patients), the median change in seizure frequency per \n28 days, the 50% or greater responder rate, and seizure-free rate following 23 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment were -40.1%, 46.6% (n = 69/148), and 11.5% (n = 17/148), respectively, for total \npartial-onset seizures. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency \n(Weeks 40-52: n = 108 patients, -69.4%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 62.0%, n = 67/108), and \nseizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 13.0%, n = 14/108) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment. \n \nIn a subset of partial-onset seizure patients with secondarily generalised seizures (n = 54 patients), the \ncorresponding values were -58.7%, 64.8% (n = 35/54), and 18.5% (n = 10/54), respectively, for \nsecondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure \nfrequency (Weeks 40-52: n = 41 patients, -73.8%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 80.5%, \nn = 33/41), and seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 24.4%, n = 10/41) were sustained following 52 weeks \nof perampanel treatment. \n \nIn patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (n = 22 patients, with 19 patients aged \n7-<12 years and 3 patients aged 4-<7 years), the median change in seizure frequency per 28 days, the \n50% or greater responder rate, and seizure-free rate were -69.2%, 63.6% (n = 14/22), and \n54.5% (n = 12/22), respectively. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency \n(Weeks 40-52: n = 13 patients, -100.0%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 61.5%, n = 8/13), and \nseizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 38.5%, n = 5/13) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment. These results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients is very small. \n \nSimilar results were obtained in a subset of patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures of \nidiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) (n = 19 patients, with 17 patients aged 7-<12 years and \n2 patients aged 4-<7 years; the corresponding values were -56.5%, 63.2% (n = 12/19), and \n52.6% (n = 10/19), respectively. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency \n(Weeks 40-52: n = 11 patients, -100.0%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 54.5%, n = 6/11), and \nseizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 36.4%, n = 4/11) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment. These results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients is very small. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of perampanel have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 79), \nadults,  adolescents, and paediatric patients with partial-onset seizures and primary generalised \ntonic-clonic seizures, adults with Parkinson’s disease, adults with diabetic neuropathy, adults with \nmultiple sclerosis, and patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nAbsorption \n \nPerampanel is readily absorbed after oral administration with no evidence of marked first--pass \nmetabolism. Co-administration of perampanel tablets with a high fat meal had no impact on the peak \nplasma exposure (Cmax) or total exposure (AUC0-inf) of perampanel. The tmax was delayed by \napproximately 1 hour compared to that under fasted conditions. \n \nDistribution \n \nData from in vitro studies indicate that perampanel is approximately 95% bound to plasma proteins. \n \nIn vitro studies show that perampanel is not a substrate or significant inhibitor of organic anion \ntransporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, organic anion transporters (OAT) 1, 2, 3, and 4, \n\n\n\n 19 \n\norganic cation transporters (OCT) 1, 2, and 3, and the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and Breast \nCancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPerampanel is extensively metabolised via primary oxidation and sequential glucuronidation. The \nmetabolism of perampanel is mediated primarily by CYP3A based on clinical study results in healthy \nsubjects administered radiolabelled perampanel and supported by in vitro studies using recombinant \nhuman CYPs and human liver microsomes. \n \nFollowing administration of radiolabelled perampanel, only trace amounts of perampanel metabolites \nwere observed in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing administration of a radiolabelled perampanel dose to either 8 healthy adults or elderly \nsubjects, approximately 30% of recovered radioactivity was found in the urine and 70% in the faeces. \nIn urine and faeces, recovered radioactivity was primarily composed of a mixture of oxidative and \nconjugated metabolites. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data from 19 Phase 1 \nstudies, the average t½ of perampanel was 105 hours. When dosed in combination with the strong \nCYP3A inducer carbamazepine, the average t½was 25 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIn a population PK analysis on pooled data from twenty Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects receiving \nperampanel between 0.2 and 36 mg either as single or multiple doses, one Phase 2 and five Phase 3 \nstudies in patients with partial-onset seizure receiving perampanel between 2 and 16 mg/day and two \nPhase 3 studies in patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving perampanel \nbetween 2 and 14 mg/day a linear relationship was found between dose and perampanel plasma \nconcentrations. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of perampanel following a single 1 mg dose were evaluated in 12 patients with \nmild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B, respectively) compared with 12 healthy, \ndemographically matched subjects. The mean apparent clearance of unbound perampanel in mildly \nimpaired patients was 188 ml/min vs. 338 ml/min in matched controls, and in moderately impaired \npatients was 120 ml/min vs. 392 ml/min in matched controls. The t½ was longer in mildly impaired \n(306 h vs. 125 h) and moderately impaired (295 h vs. 139 h) patients compared to matched healthy \nsubjects. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of perampanel have not been formally evaluated in patients with renal \nimpairment. Perampanel is eliminated almost exclusively by metabolism followed by rapid excretion \nof metabolites; only trace amounts of perampanel metabolites are observed in plasma. In a population \npharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures having creatinine clearances ranging \nfrom 39 to 160 mL/min and receiving perampanel up to 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical \ntrials, perampanel clearance was not influenced by creatinine clearance. In a population \npharmacokinetic analysis of patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving \nperampanel up to 8 mg/day in a placebo-controlled clinical study, perampanel clearance was not \ninfluenced by baseline creatinine clearance. \n \nGender \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures receiving perampanel \nup to 12 mg/day and patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving perampanel up \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nto 8 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials, perampanel clearance in females (0.54 l/h) was 18% \nlower than in males (0.66 l/h). \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures (age range 12 to \n74 years) and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (age range 12 to 58 years), and receiving \nperampanel up to 8 or 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials, no significant effect of age on \nperampanel clearance was found. A dose adjustment in the elderly is not considered to be necessary \n(see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis on pooled data from children aged 4 to 11 years, adolescent \npatients aged ≥12 years, and adults, perampanel clearance increased with an increase in body weight.  \nHence, dose adjustment in children aged 4 to 11 years with a body weight < 30 kg is necessary (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDrug interaction studies \n \nIn vitro assessment of drug interactions \n \nDrug metabolising enzyme inhibition \nIn human liver microsomes, perampanel (30 µmol/l) had a weak inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 and \nUGT1A9 among major hepatic CYPs and UGTs. \n \nDrug metabolising enzyme induction \nCompared with positive controls (including phenobarbital, rifampicin), perampanel was found to \nweakly induce CYP2B6 (30 µmol/l) and CYP3A4/5 (≥ 3 µmol/l) among major hepatic CYPs and \nUGTs in cultured human hepatocytes. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n \nIn the fertility study in rats, prolonged and irregular oestrous cycles were observed at the maximum \ntolerated dose (30 mg/kg) in females; however, these changes did not affect fertility and early \nembryonic development. There were no effects on male fertility. \n \nThe excretion into breast milk was measured in rats at 10 days post-partum. Levels peaked at one hour \nand were 3.65 times the levels in plasma. \n \nIn a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in rats, abnormal delivery and nursing conditions \nwere observed at maternally toxic doses, and the number of stillbirths was increased in offspring. \nBehavioural and reproductive development of the offspring was not affected, but some parameters of \nphysical development showed some delay, which is probably secondary to the pharmacology-based \nCNS effects of perampanel. The placental transfer was relatively low; 0.09% or less of administered \ndose was detected in the foetus. \n \nNonclinical data reveal that perampanel was not genotoxic and had no carcinogenic potential. The \nadministration of maximum tolerated doses to rats and monkeys resulted in pharmacologically-based \nCNS clinical signs and decreased terminal body weight. There were no changes directly attributable to \nperampanel in clinical pathology or histopathology. \n \n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n6.

Patients \nwho are taking concomitant medicinal products that shorten the half-life of perampanel (see \nsection 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at 1-week intervals. \n \nChildren (from 7 to 11 years of age) weighing < 20 kg \nTreatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 1 mg/day (2 ml/day). The dose may be \nincreased based on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 1 mg (2 ml) (either weekly or \nevery 2 weeks as per half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 2 mg/day \n(4 ml/day) to 4 mg/day (8 ml/day). Depending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a \ndose of 4 mg/day (8 ml/day), the dose may be increased by increments of 0.5 mg/day (1 ml/day) to \n6 mg/day (12 ml/day). Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that do not shorten the \nhalf-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at 2-week intervals. \nPatients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that shorten the half-life of perampanel (see \nsection 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at 1-week intervals. \n \nWithdrawal \nIt is recommended that discontinuation be undertaken gradually to minimise the potential for rebound \nseizures. However, due to its long half-life and subsequent slow decline in plasma concentrations, \nperampanel can be discontinued abruptly if absolutely needed. \n \nMissed doses \nSingle missed dose: As perampanel has a long half-life, the patient should wait and take their next \ndose as scheduled. \n \nIf more than 1 dose has been missed, for a continuous period of less than 5 half-lives (3 weeks for \npatients not taking perampanel metabolism-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (AED), 1 week for patients \ntaking perampanel metabolism-inducing AEDs (see section 4.5)), consideration should be given to \nre-start treatment from the last dose level. \n \nIf a patient has discontinued perampanel for a continuous period of more than 5 half-lives, it is \nrecommended that initial dosing recommendations given above should be followed. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nClinical studies of Fycompa in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and \nover to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Analysis of safety \ninformation in 905 perampanel-treated elderly patients (in double-blind studies conducted in \nnon-epilepsy indications) revealed no age-related differences in the safety profile. In combination with \nthe lack of age-related difference in perampanel exposure, the results indicate that dose-adjustment in \nthe elderly is not required. Perampanel should be used with caution in elderly taking into account the \ndrug interaction potential in polymedicated patients (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nDose adjustment is not required in patients with mild renal impairment. Use in patients with moderate \nor severe renal impairment or patients undergoing haemodialysis is not recommended. \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nDose increases in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be based on clinical \nresponse and tolerability. For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, dosing can be \ninitiated at 2 mg (4 ml). Patients should be up-titrated using 2 mg (4 ml) doses no faster than every \n2 weeks based on tolerability and effectiveness. \nPerampanel dosing for patients with mild and moderate impairment should not exceed 8 mg. \nUse in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of perampanel have not yet been established in children below 4 years of age \nin the POS indication or in children below 7 years of age in the PGTCS indication.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFycompa is for oral use. \n \nPreparation: The press-in-bottle adapter (PIBA) which is supplied in the product carton should be \ninserted firmly into the neck of the bottle before use and remain in place for the duration of the usage \nof the bottle. The oral syringe should be inserted into the PIBA and the dose withdrawn from the \ninverted bottle. The cap should be replaced after each use. The cap fits properly when the PIBA is in \nplace. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicinal \nproducts in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of \nanti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for perampanel. \nTherefore, patients (children, adolescents, and adults) should be monitored for signs of suicidal \nideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of \npatients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour \nemerge. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms (DRESS) and Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, \nhave been reported (frequency unknown; see section 4.8) in association with perampanel treatment. \n \nAt the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored \nclosely for skin reactions. \n \nSymptoms of DRESS include typically, although not exclusively, fever, rash associated with other \norgan system involvement, lymphadenopathy, liver function tests abnormalities and eosinophilia. It is \nimportant to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may \nbe present even though rash is not evident. \n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nSymptoms of SJS include typically although not exclusively, skin detachment (epidermal \nnecrosis/blister) < 10%, erythematous skin (confluent), rapid progression, painful atypical target-like \nlesions and/or purpuric macules in wide dissemination or large erythema (confluent), bullous/erosive \ninvolvement of more than 2 mucous membranes. \n \nIf signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, perampanel should be withdrawn \nimmediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). \n \nIf the patient has developed a serious reaction such as SJS or DRESS with the use of perampanel, \ntreatment with perampanel must not be restarted in this patient at any time. \n \nAbsence and myoclonic seizures \n \nAbsence and myoclonic seizures are two common generalised seizure types that frequently occur in \nIGE patients. Other AEDs are known to induce or aggravate these seizure types. Patients with \nmyoclonic seizures and absence seizures should be monitored while on Fycompa. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nPerampanel may cause dizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see section 4.7). \n \nHormonal contraceptives \n \nAt doses of 12 mg/day Fycompa may decrease the effectiveness of progestative-containing hormonal \ncontraceptives; in this circumstance additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended \nwhen using Fycompa (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \n \nFalls \n \nThere appears to be an increased risk of falls, particularly in the elderly; the underlying reason is \nunclear. \n \nAggression \n \nAggressive and hostile behaviour has been reported in patients receiving perampanel therapy. In \nperampanel-treated patients in clinical trials, aggression, anger and irritability were reported more \nfrequently at higher doses. Most of the reported events were either mild or moderate and patients \nrecovered either spontaneously or with dose adjustment. However, thoughts of harming others, \nphysical assault or threatening behaviour were observed in some patients (<1% in perampanel clinical \nstudies). Homicidal ideation has been reported in patients. Patients and caregivers should be \ncounselled to alert a healthcare professional immediately if significant changes in mood or patterns of \nbehaviour are noted. The dosage of perampanel should be reduced if such symptoms occur and should \nbe discontinued immediately if symptoms are severe. \n \nAbuse potential \n \nCaution should be exercised in patients with a history of substance abuse and the patient should be \nmonitored for symptoms of perampanel abuse. \n \nConcomitant CYP 3A inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products \n \nResponse rates after addition of perampanel at fixed doses were less when patients received \nconcomitant CYP3A enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products (carbamazepine, phenytoin, \noxcarbazepine) as compared to response rates in patient who received concomitant \nnon-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products. Patients’ response should be monitored when \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nthey are switching from concomitant non-inducer anti-epileptic medicinal products to enzyme \ninducing medicinal products and vice versa. Depending upon individual clinical response and \ntolerability, the dose may be increased or decreased 2 mg at a time (see section 4.2). \n \nOther concomitant (non- anti-epileptic) cytochrome P450 inducing or inhibiting medicinal products \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for tolerability and clinical response when adding or removing \ncytochrome P450 inducers or inhibitors, since perampanel plasma levels can be decreased or \nincreased; the dose of perampanel may need to be adjusted accordingly. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nCases of hepatotoxicity (mainly hepatic enzyme increased) with perampanel in combination with other \nantiepileptic drugs have been reported. If hepatic enzymes elevation is observed, monitoring of liver \nfunction should be considered. \n \nExcipients \n \nFructose intolerance \nFycompa contains sorbitol (E420); therefore, patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicinal product. \n \nCaution should be exercised when combining Fycompa oral suspension with other antiepileptic \nmedications containing sorbitol, since a combined intake of over 1 gram of sorbitol may affect \nabsorption of some drugs. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFycompa is not considered a strong inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 or UGT enzymes (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHormonal contraceptives \n \nIn healthy women receiving 12 mg (but not 4 or 8 mg/day) for 21 days concomitantly with a combined \noral contraceptive, Fycompa was shown to decrease the levonorgestrel exposure (mean Cmax and AUC \nvalues were each decreased by 40%). Ethinylestradiol AUC was not affected by Fycompa 12 mg \nwhereas Cmax was decreased by 18%. Therefore, the possibility of decreased efficacy of hormonal \nprogestative-containing contraceptives should be considered for women needing Fycompa 12 mg/day \nand an additional reliable method (intra-uterine device (IUD), condom) is to be used (see section 4.4). \n \nInteractions between Fycompa and other anti-epileptic medicinal products \n \nPotential interactions between Fycompa and other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were assessed in \nclinical studies. A population PK analysis of three pooled Phase 3 studies in adolescent and adult \npatients with partial-onset seizures evaluated the effect of Fycompa (up to 12 mg once daily) on the \nPK of other AEDs. In another population PK analysis of pooled data from twenty Phase 1 studies in \nhealthy subjects, with Fycompa up to 36 mg, and one Phase 2 and six Phase 3 studies in  paediatric, \nadolescent and adult patients with partial-onset seizures or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, \nwith Fycompa up to 16 mg once daily, evaluated the effect of concomitant AEDs of perampanel \nclearance. The effect of these interactions on average steady state concentration is summarised in the \nfollowing table. \n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nAED \ncoadministered \n\nInfluence of AED on Fycompa \nconcentration \n\nInfluence of Fycompa on AED \nconcentration \n\nCarbamazepine 3 fold decrease <10% decrease \nClobazam No influence <10% decrease \nClonazepam No influence No influence \nLamotrigine No influence <10% decrease \nLevetiracetam No influence No influence \nOxcarbazepine 2 fold decrease 35% increase 1) \nPhenobarbital 20% decrease No influence \nPhenytoin 2 fold decrease No influence \nTopiramate 20% decrease No influence \nValproic Acid No influence <10% decrease \nZonisamide No influence No influence \n\n1) Active metabolite monohydroxycarbazepine was not assessed. \n \nBased on the results from the  population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset \nseizures and patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures the total clearance of Fycompa \nwas increased when co-administered with carbamazepine (3-fold), and phenytoin or oxcarbazepine \n(2-fold), which are known inducers of enzymes of metabolism (see section 5.2). This effect should be \ntaken into account and managed when adding or withdrawing these anti-epileptic drugs from a \npatient’s treatment regimen. Clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, topiramate, zonisamide, \nclobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid did not affect to a clinically relevant manner the clearance of \nFycompa. \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures, Fycompa did not \naffect to a clinically relevant manner the clearance of clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, \nphenytoin, topiramate, zonisamide, carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid, at the \nhighest perampanel dose evaluated (12 mg/day). \n \nPerampanel was found to decrease the clearance of oxcarbazepine by 26%. Oxcarbazepine is rapidly \nmetabolised by cytosolic reductase enzyme to the active metabolite, monohydroxycarbazepine. The \neffect of perampanel on monohydroxycarbazepine concentrations is not known. \n \nPerampanel is dosed to clinical effect regardless of other AEDs. \n \nEffect of perampanel on CYP3A substrates \n \nIn healthy subjects, Fycompa (6 mg once daily for 20 days) decreased midazolam AUC by 13%. A \nlarger decrease in exposure of midazolam (or other sensitive CYP3A substrates) at higher Fycompa \ndoses cannot be excluded. \n \nEffect of cytochrome P450 inducers on perampanel pharmacokinetics \n \nStrong inducers of cytochrome P450, such as rifampicin and hypericum, are expected to decrease \nperampanel concentrations and the potential for higher plasma concentrations of reactive metabolites \nin their presence has not been excluded. Felbamate has been shown to decrease the concentrations of \nsome medicinal products and may also reduce perampanel concentrations. \n \nEffect of cytochrome P450 inhibitors on perampanel pharmacokinetics \n \nIn healthy subjects, the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 10 days) increased \nperampanel AUC by 20% and prolonged perampanel half--life by 15% (67.8 h vs 58.4 h). Larger \neffects cannot be excluded when perampanel is combined with a CYP3A inhibitor with longer half-life \nthan ketoconazole or when the inhibitor is given for a longer treatment duration. \n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nLevodopa \nIn healthy subjects, Fycompa (4 mg once daily for 19 days) had no effect on Cmax or AUC of levodopa. \n \nAlcohol \n \nThe effects of perampanel on tasks involving alertness and vigilance such as driving ability were \nadditive or supra-additive to the effects of alcohol itself, as found in a pharmacodynamic interaction \nstudy in healthy subjects. Multiple dosing of perampanel 12 mg/day increased levels of anger, \nconfusion, and depression as assessed using the Profile of Mood State 5-point rating scale (see \nsection 5.1). These effects may also be seen when Fycompa is used in combination with other central \nnervous system (CNS) depressants. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of  adolescent patients age ≥ 12 years and children age 4 to \n11 years, there were no notable differences compared to the adult population. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential and contraception in males and females \n \nFycompa is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless \nclearly necessary. Fycompa may decrease the effectiveness of progestative-containing hormonal \ncontraceptives. An additional non-hormonal form of contraception is, therefore recommended (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amounts of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of perampanel in \npregnant women. Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but \nembryotoxicity was observed in rats at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). Fycompa is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nStudies in lactating rats have shown excretion of perampanel and/or its metabolites in milk (for details \nsee section 5.3). It is not known whether perampanel is excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from Fycompa therapy taking into account the benefit of breast--feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nIn the fertility study in rats, prolonged and irregular oestrous cycles were observed at high-dose \n(30 mg/kg) in females; however, these changes did not affect the fertility and early embryonic \ndevelopment. There were no effects on male fertility (see section 5.3). The effect of perampanel on \nhuman fertility has not been established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFycompa has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPerampanel may cause dizziness and somnolence and, therefore, may influence the ability to drive or \nuse machines. Patients are advised not to drive a vehicle, operate complex machinery or engage in \nother potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether perampanel affects their ability to \nperform these tasks (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn all controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with partial-onset seizures, 1,639 patients have \nreceived perampanel of whom 1,147 have been treated for 6 months and 703 for longer than \n12 months. \n \nIn the controlled and uncontrolled study in patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, \n114 patients have received perampanel of whom 68 have been treated for 6 months and 36 for longer \nthan 12 months. \n \nAdverse reactions leading to discontinuation: \nIn the controlled Phase 3 partial-onset seizures clinical trials, the rate of discontinuation as a result of \nan adverse reaction was 1.7% (3/172), 4.2% (18/431) and 13.7% (35/255) in patients randomised to \nreceive perampanel at the recommended doses of 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg/day, respectively, and \n1.4% (6/442) in patients randomised to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly (≥ 1% \nin the total perampanel group and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness and \nsomnolence. \n \nIn the controlled Phase 3 primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures clinical trial, the rate of \ndiscontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 4.9% (4/81) in patients randomised to receive \nperampanel 8 mg, and 1.2% (1/82) in patients randomised to receive placebo. The adverse reaction \nmost commonly leading to discontinuation (≥ 2% in the perampanel group and greater than placebo) \nwas dizziness. \n \nPost-marketing use \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms (DRESS) have been reported in association with perampanel treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below, adverse reactions, which were identified based on review of the full Fycompa \nclinical studies safety database, are listed by System Organ Class and frequency. The following \nconvention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nWithin each frequency category, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Decreased appetite \nIncreased appetite \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Aggression \nAnger \nAnxiety \nConfusional state \n\nSuicidal \nideation \nSuicide attempt \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness \nSomnolence \n\nAtaxia \nDysarthria \nBalance disorder \nIrritability \n\n  \n\nEye disorders  Diplopia \nVision blurred \n\n  \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n   Drug Reaction \nwith \nEosinophilia and \nSystemic \nSymptoms \n(DRESS)* \nStevens - Johnso\nn Syndrome \n(SJS)* \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Back pain   \n\nGeneral disorders  Gait disturbance \nFatigue \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Weight increased   \nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Fall   \n\n* See section 4.4 \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents exposed to perampanel from double-blind \nstudies for partial-onset seizures and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, the overall safety \nprofile in adolescents was similar to that of adults, except for aggression, which was observed more \nfrequently in adolescents than in adults. \n \nBased on the clinical trial database of 180 paediatric patients exposed to perampanel from a \nmulticentre, open label study, the overall safety profile in children was similar to that established for  \nadolescents and adults, except for somnolence, irritability, aggression, and agitation, which were \nobserved more frequently in the paediatric study compared to studies in adolescents and adults. \n \nAvailable data in children did not suggest any clinically significant effects of perampanel on growth \nand development parameters including body weight, height, thyroid function, insulin-like growth \nfactor-1 (IGF-1) level, cognition (as assessed by Aldenkamp-Baker neuropsychological assessment \nschedule [ABNAS]), behaviour (as assessed by Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]), and  dexterity (as \nassessed by Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test [LGPT]). However, long term effects [greater than \n1 year] on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, and puberty in children remain unknown. \n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with perampanel overdose in humans. In a report of an intentional \noverdose that could have resulted in a dose up to 264 mg, the patient experienced events of altered \nmental status, agitation and aggressive behaviour and recovered without sequelae. There is no \navailable specific antidote to the effects of perampanel. General supportive care of the patient is \nindicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. In \nview of its long half-life, the effects caused by perampanel could be prolonged. Because of low renal \nclearance special interventions such as forced diuresis, dialysis or haemoperfusion are unlikely to be of \nvalue. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX22 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPerampanel is a first-in-class selective, non-competitive antagonist of the ionotropic α-amino-3-\nhydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepopionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor on post-synaptic neurons. \nGlutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is implicated in \na number of neurological disorders caused by neuronal overexcitation. Activation of AMPA receptors \nby glutamate is thought to be responsible for most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. In \nin vitro studies, perampanel did not compete with AMPA for binding to the AMPA receptor, but \nperampanel binding was displaced by noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists, indicating that \nperampanel is a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist. In vitro, perampanel inhibited \nAMPA-induced (but not NMDA-induced) increase in intracellular calcium. In vivo, perampanel \nsignificantly prolonged seizure latency in an AMPA-induced seizure model. \n \nThe precise mechanism by which perampanel exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be \nfully elucidated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nA pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data \nfrom the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. In addition, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic \n(efficacy) analysis was performed in one efficacy trial for primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. In \nboth analyses, perampanel exposure is correlated with reduction in seizure frequency. \n \nPsychomotor performance \nSingle and multiple doses of 8 mg and 12 mg impaired psychomotor performance in healthy \nvolunteers in a dose-related manner. The effects of perampanel on complex tasks such as driving \nability were additive or supra-additive to the impairment effects of alcohol. Psychomotor performance \ntesting returned to baseline within 2 weeks of cessation of perampanel dosing. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 36 \n\nCognitive function \nIn a healthy volunteer study to assess the effects of perampanel on alertness, and memory using a \nstandard battery of assessments, no effects of perampanel were found following single and multiple \ndoses of perampanel up to 12 mg/day. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled study conducted in adolescent patients, no significant changes in cognition \nrelative to placebo as measured by Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition Score \nwere observed for perampanel. In the open label extension, no significant changes were observed in \nglobal CDR system score after 52 weeks of perampanel treatment (see section 5.1 Paediatric \npopulation). \n \nIn an open-label uncontrolled study conducted in paediatric patients, no clinically important changes \nin cognition relative to baseline as measured by ABNAS were observed following adjunctive \nperampanel (see section 5.1 Paediatric population). \n \nAlertness and mood \nLevels of alertness (arousal) decreased in a dose-related manner in healthy subjects dosed with \nperampanel from 4 to 12 mg/day. Mood deteriorated following dosing of 12 mg/day only; the changes \nin mood were small and reflected a general lowering of alertness. Multiple dosing of perampanel \n12 mg/day also enhanced the effects of alcohol on vigilance and alertness, and increased levels of \nanger, confusion and depression as assessed using the Profile of Mood State 5-point rating scale. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nPerampanel did not prolong the QTc interval when administered in daily doses up to 12 mg/day, and \ndid not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPartial-Onset Seizures \nThe efficacy of perampanel in partial-onset seizures was established in three adjunctive therapy \n19 week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials in adult and adolescent \npatients. Patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation and were not \nadequately controlled with one to three concomitant AEDs. During a 6-week baseline period, patients \nwere required to have more than five seizures with no seizure-free period exceeding 25 days. In these \nthree trials, patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 21.06 years. Between 85.3% \nand 89.1% of patients were taking two to three concomitant AEDs with or without concurrent vagal \nnerve stimulation. \n \nTwo studies (studies 304 and 305) compared doses of perampanel 8 and 12 mg/day with placebo and \nthe third study (study 306) compared doses of perampanel 2, 4 and 8 mg/day with placebo. In all three \ntrials, following a 6-week Baseline Phase to establish baseline seizure frequency prior to \nrandomisation, patients were randomised and titrated to the randomised dose. During the Titration \nPhase in all three trials, treatment was initiated at 2 mg/day and increased in weekly increments of \n2 mg/day to the target dose. Patients experiencing intolerable adverse events could remain on the same \ndose or have their dose decreased to the previously tolerated dose. In all three trials, the Titration \nPhase was followed by a Maintenance Phase that lasted 13 weeks, during which patients were to \nremain on a stable dose of perampanel. \n \nThe pooled 50% responder rates were placebo 19%, 4 mg 29%, 8 mg 35% and 12 mg 35%. A \nstatistically significant effect on the reduction in 28-day seizure frequency (Baseline to Treatment \nPhase) as compared to the placebo group was observed with perampanel treatment at doses of \n4 mg/day (Study 306), 8 mg/day (Studies 304, 305 and 306), and 12 mg/day (Studies 304 and 305). \nThe 50% responder rates in the 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg groups were respectively 23.0%, 31.5%, and \n30.0% in combination with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products and were 33.3%, \n46.5% and 50.0% when perampanel was given in combination with non-enzyme-inducing \nanti-epileptic medicinal products. These studies show that once-daily administration of perampanel at \n\n\n\n 37 \n\ndoses of 4 mg to 12 mg was significantly more efficacious than placebo as adjunctive treatment in this \npopulation. \n \nData from placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that improvement in seizure control is observed \nwith a once-daily perampanel dose of 4 mg and this benefit is enhanced as the dose is increased to \n8 mg/day. No efficacy benefit was observed at the dose of 12 mg as compared to the dose of 8 mg in \nthe overall population. Benefit at the dose of 12 mg was observed in some patients who tolerate the \ndose of 8 mg and when the clinical response to that dose was insufficient. A clinically meaningful \nreduction in seizure frequency relative to placebo was achieved as early as the second week of dosing \nwhen patients reached a daily dose of 4 mg. \n \n1.7 to 5.8% of the patients on perampanel in the clinical studies became seizure free during the \n3 month maintenance period compared with 0%-1.0% on placebo. \n \nOpen label extension study \nNinety-seven percent of the patients who completed the randomised trials in patients with partial-onset \nseizures were enrolled in the open label extension study (n = 1186). Patients from the randomised trial \nwere converted to perampanel over 16 weeks followed by a long-term maintenance period (≥ 1 year). \nThe mean average daily dose was 10.05 mg. \n \nPrimary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures \nPerampanel as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with idiopathic generalised \nepilepsy experiencing primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures was established in a multicentre, \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 332). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 \nto 3 AEDs experiencing at least 3 primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures during the 8-week baseline \nperiod were randomised to either perampanel or placebo. The population included 164 patients \n(perampanel N = 82, placebo N = 82). Patients were titrated over four weeks to a target dose of 8 mg \nper day or the highest tolerated dose and treated for an additional 13 weeks on the last dose level \nachieved at the end of the titration period. The total treatment period was 17 weeks. Study drug was \ngiven once per day. \n \nThe 50% primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures responder rate during the Maintenance Period was \nsignificantly higher in the perampanel group (58.0%) than in the placebo group (35.8%), P = 0.0059. \nThe 50% responder rate was 22.2% in combination with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal \nproducts and was 69.4% when perampanel was given in combination with non-enzyme-inducing \nanti-epileptic medicinal products. The number of perampanel patients taking enzyme-inducing \nanti-epileptic medicinal products was small (n = 9). The median percent change in primary generalised \ntonic-clonic seizure frequency per 28 days during the Titration and Maintenance Periods (combined) \nrelative to Prerandomisation was greater with perampanel (-76.5%) than with placebo (-38.4%), \nP < 0.0001. During the 3 months maintenance period, 30.9% (25/81) of the patients on perampanel in \nthe clinical studies became free of PGTC seizures compared with 12.3% (10/81) on placebo. \n \nOther subtypes of idiopathic generalised seizure \nThe efficacy and safety of perampanel in patients with myoclonic seizures have not been established. \nThe available data are insufficient to reach any conclusions. \nThe efficacy of perampanel in the treatment of absence seizures has not been demonstrated. \nIn Study 332, in patients with PGTC seizures who also had concomitant myoclonic seizures, freedom \nfrom seizures was achieved in 16.7% (4/24) on perampanel compared to 13.0% (3/23) in those on \nplacebo. In patients with concomitant absence seizures, freedom from seizures was achieved in 22.2% \n(6/27) on perampanel compared to 12.1% (4/33) on placebo. Freedom from all seizures was achieved \nin 23.5% (19/81) of patients on perampanel compared to 4.9% (4/81) of patients on placebo. \n \nOpen label extension phase \nOf the 140 patients who completed the Study 332, 114 patients (81.4%) had entered the Extension \nphase. Patients from the randomised trial were converted to perampanel over 6 weeks followed by a \nlong-term maintenance period (≥ 1 year). In the Extension Phase, 73.7% (84/114) of patients have a \n\n\n\n 38 \n\nmodal daily perampanel dose of greater than 4 to 8 mg/day and 16.7% (19/114) had a modal daily \ndose of greater than 8 to 12 mg/day. A decrease in PGTC seizure frequency of at least 50% was seen \nin 65.9% (29/44) of patients after 1 year of treatment during the Extension Phase (relative to their \npre-perampanel baseline seizure frequency). These data were consistent with those for percent change \nin seizure frequency and showed that the PGTC 50% responder rate was generally stable across time \nfrom about week 26 through the end of year 2. Similar results were seen when all seizures and absence \nvs. myoclonic seizures were evaluated over time. \n \nConversion to monotherapy \nIn a retrospective study of clinical practice, 51 patients with epilepsy who received perampanel as \nadjunctive treatment converted to perampanel monotherapy. The majority of these patients had a \nhistory of partial onset seizures. Of these, 14 patients (27%) reverted to adjunctive therapy in the \nfollowing months. Thirty four (34) patients were followed up for at least 6 months and, of these, \n24 patients (71%) remained on perampanel monotherapy for at least 6 months. Ten (10) patients were \nfollowed up for at least 18 months and, of these, 3 patients (30%) remained on perampanel \nmonotherapy for at least 18 months. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFycompa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment-resistant epilepsies \n(localisation-related and age-related epilepsy syndromes) (see section 4.2 for information on \nadolescent and paediatric use). \n \nThe three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 studies included 143 adolescents between \nthe ages of 12 and 18. The results in these adolescents were similar to those seen in the adult \npopulation. \n \nStudy 332 included 22 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18. The results in these adolescents \nwere similar to those seen in the adult population. \n \nA 19-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label extension phase \n(Study 235) was performed to assess the short-term effects on cognition of Fycompa (target dose range \nof 8 to 12 mg once daily) as adjunctive therapy in 133 (Fycompa n = 85, placebo n = 48) adolescent \npatients, aged 12 to less than 18 years old, with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. \nCognitive function was assessed by the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition \nt-Score, which is a composite score derived from 5 domains testing Power of Attention, Continuity of \nAttention, Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory, Quality of Working Memory, and Speed of \nMemory. The mean change (SD) from baseline to end of double-blind treatment (19 weeks) in CDR \nSystem Global Cognition t-Score was 1.1 (7.14) in the placebo group and (minus) –1.0 (8.86) in the \nperampanel group, with the difference between the treatment groups in LS means \n(95% CI) = (minus) -2.2 (-5.2, 0.8). There was no statistically significant difference between the \ntreatment groups (p = 0.145). CDR System Global Cognition t-Scores for placebo and perampanel \nwere 41.2 (10.7) and 40.8 (13.0), respectively at the baseline. For patients with perampanel in the open \nlabel extension (n = 112), the mean change (SD) from baseline to end of open-label treatment \n(52 weeks) in CDR System Global Cognition t-Score was (minus) -1.0 (9.91). This was not \nstatistically significant (p = 0.96). After up to 52 weeks of treatment with perampanel (n = 114), no \neffect on bone growth was observed. No effects on weight, height and sexual development were seen \nfollowing up to 104 weeks of treatment (n = 114). \n \nAn open-label, uncontrolled study (Study 311) was performed to assess the exposure-efficacy \nrelationship of perampanel as adjunctive therapy in 180 paediatric patients (aged 4 to 11 years old) \nwith inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. \nPatients were titrated over 11 weeks to a target dose of 8 mg/day or the maximum tolerated dose (not \nto exceed 12 mg/day) for patients not taking concomitant CYP3A-inducing antiepileptic drugs \n(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine and phenytoin) or 12 mg/day or the maximum \n\n\n\n 39 \n\ntolerated dose (not to exceed 16 mg/day) for patients taking a concomitant CYP3A-inducing \nantiepileptic drug. Perampanel dose achieved at the end of titration was maintained for 12 weeks (for a \ntotal of 23 weeks of exposure) at the completion of the core study. Patients who entered into Extension \nPhase were treated for an additional 29 weeks for a total exposure duration of 52 weeks. \n \nIn patients with partial-onset seizures (n = 148 patients), the median change in seizure frequency per \n28 days, the 50% or greater responder rate, and seizure-free rate following 23 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment were -40.1%, 46.6% (n = 69/148), and 11.5% (n = 17/148), respectively, for total \npartial-onset seizures. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency \n(Weeks 40-52: n = 108 patients, -69.4%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 62.0%, n = 67/108), and \nseizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 13.0%, n = 14/108) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment. \n \nIn a subset of partial-onset seizure patients with secondarily generalised seizures, the corresponding \nvalues were -58.7%, 64.8% (n = 35/54), and 18.5% (n = 10/54), respectively, for secondarily \ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency \n(Weeks 40-52: n = 41 patients, -73.8%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 80.5%, n = 33/41), and \nseizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 24.4%, n = 10/41) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment. \n \nIn patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (n = 22 patients, with 19 patients aged \n7-<12 years and 3 patients aged 4-<7 years), the median change in seizure frequency per 28 days, the \n50% or greater responder rate, and seizure-free rate were -69.2%, 63.6% ( n = 14/22), and \n54.5% (n = 12/22), respectively. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency \n(Weeks 40-52: n = 13 patients, -100.0%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 61.5%, n = 8/13), and \nseizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 38.5%, n = 5/13) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment. These results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients is very small. \n \nSimilar results were obtained in a subset of patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures of \nidiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) (n = 19 patients, with 17 patients aged 7-<12 years and \n2 patients aged 4-<7 years; the corresponding values were -56.5%, 63.2% (n = 12/19), and \n52.6% (n = 10/19), respectively. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency \n(Weeks 40-52: n = 11 patients, -100.0%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 54.5%, n = 6/11), and \nseizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 36.4%, n = 4/11) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel \ntreatment. These results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients is very small. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of perampanel have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 79), \nadults,  adolescents, and paediatric patients with partial-onset seizures and primary generalised \ntonic-clonic seizures, adults with Parkinson’s disease, adults with diabetic neuropathy, adults with \nmultiple sclerosis, and patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nAbsorption \n \nPerampanel is readily absorbed after oral administration with no evidence of marked first-pass \nmetabolism. \n \nPerampanel oral suspension is bioequivalent on a mg per mg basis to perampanel tablets under fasted \nconditions. When a single 12-mg dose of both formulations was administered with a high fat meal, \nperampanel oral suspension achieves equivalent AUC0-inf  and approximately 23 % lower Cmax and \n2 hours delay in time to peak exposure (tmax) compared to the tablet formulation. However, population \npharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that under simulated steady state exposure conditions, Cmax \nand AUC, of perampanel oral suspension were bioequivalent to the tablet formulation under both \nfasted and fed conditions. \n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nWhen coadministered with a high fat meal, Cmax and AUC0-inf of a single 12-mg dose of perampanel \noral suspension were approximately 22% and 13%, respectively, lower compared to fasted conditions. \n \nDistribution \n \nData from in vitro studies indicate that perampanel is approximately 95% bound to plasma proteins. \n \nIn vitro studies show that perampanel is not a substrate or significant inhibitor of organic anion \ntransporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, organic anion transporters (OAT) 1, 2, 3, and 4, \norganic cation transporters (OCT) 1, 2, and 3, and the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and Breast \nCancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPerampanel is extensively metabolised via primary oxidation and sequential glucuronidation. The \nmetabolism of perampanel is mediated primarily by CYP3A based on clinical study results in healthy \nsubjects administered radiolabelled perampanel and supported by in vitro studies using recombinant \nhuman CYPs and human liver microsomes. \n \nFollowing administration of radiolabelled perampanel, only trace amounts of perampanel metabolites \nwere observed in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing administration of a radiolabelled perampanel dose to either 8 healthy adults or elderly \nsubjects, approximately 30% of recovered radioactivity was found in the urine and 70% in the faeces. \nIn urine and faeces, recovered radioactivity was primarily composed of a mixture of oxidative and \nconjugated metabolites. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data from 19 Phase 1 \nstudies, the average t½ of perampanel was 105 hours. When dosed in combination with the strong \nCYP3A inducer carbamazepine, the average t½was 25 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIn a population PK analysis on pooled data from twenty Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects receiving \nperampanel between 0.2 and 36 mg either as single or multiple doses, one Phase 2 and five Phase 3 \nstudies in patients with partial-onset seizure receiving perampanel between 2 and 16 mg/day and two \nPhase 3 studies in patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving perampanel \nbetween 2 and 14 mg/day a linear relationship was found between dose and perampanel plasma \nconcentrations. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of perampanel following a single 1 mg dose were evaluated in 12 patients with \nmild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B, respectively) compared with 12 healthy, \ndemographically matched subjects. The mean apparent clearance of unbound perampanel in mildly \nimpaired patients was 188 ml/min vs. 338 ml/min in matched controls, and in moderately impaired \npatients was 120 ml/min vs. 392 ml/min in matched controls. The t½ was longer in mildly impaired \n(306 h vs. 125 h) and moderately impaired (295 h vs. 139 h) patients compared to matched healthy \nsubjects. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of perampanel have not been formally evaluated in patients with renal \nimpairment. Perampanel is eliminated almost exclusively by metabolism followed by rapid excretion \nof metabolites; only trace amounts of perampanel metabolites are observed in plasma. In a population \npharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures having creatinine clearances ranging \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nfrom 39 to 160 mL/min and receiving perampanel up to 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical \ntrials, perampanel clearance was not influenced by creatinine clearance. In a population \npharmacokinetic analysis of patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving \nperampanel up to 8 mg/day in a placebo-controlled clinical study, perampanel clearance was not \ninfluenced by baseline creatinine clearance. \n \nGender \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures receiving perampanel \nup to 12 mg/day and patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving perampanel up \nto 8 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials, perampanel clearance in females (0.54 l/h) was 18% \nlower than in males (0.66 l/h). \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures (age range 12 to \n74 years) and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (age range 12 to 58 years), and receiving \nperampanel up to 8 or 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials, no significant effect of age on \nperampanel clearance was found. A dose adjustment in the elderly is not considered to be necessary \n(see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis on pooled data from children aged 4 to 11 years, adolescent \npatients aged ≥12 years, and adults, perampanel clearance increased with an increase in body weight.  \nHence, dose adjustment in children aged 4 to 11 years with a body weight < 30 kg is necessary (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDrug interaction studies \n \nIn vitro assessment of drug interactions \n \nDrug metabolising enzyme inhibition \nIn human liver microsomes, perampanel (30 µmol/l) had a weak inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 and \nUGT1A9 among major hepatic CYPs and UGTs. \n \nDrug metabolising enzyme induction \nCompared with positive controls (including phenobarbital, rifampicin), perampanel was found to \nweakly induce CYP2B6 (30 µmol/l) and CYP3A4/5 (≥ 3 µmol/l) among major hepatic CYPs and \nUGTs in cultured human hepatocytes. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n \nIn the fertility study in rats, prolonged and irregular oestrous cycles were observed at the maximum \ntolerated dose (30 mg/kg) in females; however, these changes did not affect fertility and early \nembryonic development. There were no effects on male fertility. \n \nThe excretion into breast milk was measured in rats at 10 days post-partum. Levels peaked at one hour \nand were 3.65 times the levels in plasma. \n \nIn a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in rats, abnormal delivery and nursing conditions \nwere observed at maternally toxic doses, and the number of stillbirths was increased in offspring. \nBehavioural and reproductive development of the offspring was not affected, but some parameters of \nphysical development showed some delay, which is probably secondary to the pharmacology-based \nCNS effects of perampanel. The placental transfer was relatively low; 0.09% or less of administered \ndose was detected in the foetus. \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n \nNonclinical data reveal that perampanel was not genotoxic and had no carcinogenic potential. The \nadministration of maximum tolerated doses to rats and monkeys resulted in pharmacologically-based \nCNS clinical signs and decreased terminal body weight. There were no changes directly attributable to \nperampanel in clinical pathology or histopathology. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take Fycompa \n3. How to take Fycompa \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fycompa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fycompa is and what it is used for \n \nFycompa contains a medicine called perampanel. It belongs to a group of medicines called \nanti epileptics. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy - where someone has repeated fits (seizures). \nIt has been given to you by your doctor to reduce the number of fits that you have. \n \nFycompa is used in association with other antiepileptic drugs to treat certain forms of epilepsy:  \nIn adults, adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 4 to 11 years) \n- It is used to treat fits that affect one part of your brain (called a “partial seizure”). \n- These partial seizures may or may not then be followed by a fit affecting all of your brain \n\n(called a “secondary generalisation”). \nIn adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 7 to 11 years) \n- It is also used to treat certain fits that affect all of your brain from the start (called “generalised \n\nseizures”) and cause convulsions or staring spells. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Fycompa \n \nDO NOT TAKE Fycompa: \n- If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores \n\nafter taking perampanel. \n- If you are allergic to perampanel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fycompa if you have liver problems or moderate or \nsevere kidney problems. \nYou should not take Fycompa if you have serious liver problems or moderate or serious kidney \nproblems. \nBefore taking this medicine you should tell your doctor if you have a history of alcoholism or drug \ndependence. \n\n\n\n 71 \n\nCases of increased liver enzymes have been reported in some patients taking Fycompa in combination \nwith other antiepileptic drugs. \n \n- Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. \n- Fycompa may make you more likely to fall over, particularly if you are an older person; this \n\nmight be due to your illness. \n- Fycompa may make you aggressive, angry or violent. It may also cause you to have unusual or \n\nextreme changes in behaviour or mood. \nIf any of these happens, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nA small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, contact your doctor straight away. \n \nSerious skin reactions including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and \nStevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been reported with the use of perampanel. \n- DRESS typically, although not exclusively, appears as flu-like symptoms and a rash with a high \n\nbody temperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type \nof white blood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. \n\n- Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) can appear initially as reddish target- like spots or circular \npatches often with central blisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and \neyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever \nand/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-\nthreatening complications or be fatal. \n\n \nIf you experience any of the above after taking Fycompa (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \nChildren \nFycompa is not recommended for children aged under 4. The safety and effectiveness are not yet \nknown in children under 4 years of age for partial seizures and under 7 years of age in generalised \nseizures. \n \nOther medicines and Fycompa \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Taking \nFycompa with certain other medicines may cause side effects or affect how they work. Do not start or \nstop other medicines without talking to your doctor or pharmacist. \n- Other anti-epileptic medicines, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin that are \n\nused to treat fits may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken \nthese medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. \n\n- Felbamate (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) may also affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you \nare taking or have recently taken this medicine as your dose may need to be adjusted. \n\n- Midazolam (a medicine used to stop prolonged, acute (sudden) convulsive seizures, for sedation \nand sleep problem) may be affected by Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking midazolam \nas your dose may need to be adjusted. \n\n- Some other medicines such as rifampicin (a medicine used to treat bacterial infections), \nhypericum (St. John’s Wort) (a medicine used to treat mild anxiety) and ketoconazole (a \nmedicine used to treat fungal infections) may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking \nor have recently taken these medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. \n\n- Hormonal contraceptives (including oral contraceptives, implants, injections, and patches) \nTell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make certain hormonal \ncontraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other forms of safe and effective \ncontraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You should continue doing this for \none month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may be appropriate contraception \nfor you. \n \n\n\n\n 72 \n\nFycompa with alcohol \nSpeak to your doctor before drinking alcohol.

Do not stop treatment without first discussing it \nwith your doctor. \n- Fycompa is not recommended in pregnancy. \n- You must use a reliable method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are \n\nbeing treated with Fycompa. You should continue doing this for one month after stopping \ntreatment. Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives.

You should use other \nforms of safe and effective contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You \nshould also do this for one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may \nbe appropriate contraception for you. \n\nIt is not known whether the ingredients of Fycompa can pass into breast milk. \nThe doctor will weigh up the benefit and risks to your baby of taking Fycompa while you are \nbreast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machines until you know how Fycompa affects you. \nYou must talk to your doctor about the effect of your epilepsy on driving and using machines. \n- Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. If this \n\nhappens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n- Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa may make these effects worse. \n \nFycompa contains lactose \nFycompa contains lactose (a type of sugar).

What you need to know before you take Fycompa \n3. How to take Fycompa \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fycompa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fycompa is and what it is used for \n \nFycompa contains a medicine called perampanel. It belongs to a group of medicines called \nanti-epileptics. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy - where someone has repeated fits \n(seizures). It has been given to you by your doctor to reduce the number of fits that you have. \n \nFycompa is used in association with other antiepileptic drugs to treat certain forms of epilepsy:  \nIn adults, adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 4 to 11 years) \n- It is used to treat fits that affect one part of your brain (called a “partial seizure”). \n- These partial seizures may or may not then be followed by a fit affecting all of your brain \n\n(called a “secondary generalisation”). \nIn adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 7 to 11 years) \n- It is also used to treat certain fits that affect all of your brain from the start (called “generalised \n\nseizures”) and cause convulsions or staring spells. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Fycompa \n \n DO NOT TAKE Fycompa: \n- If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores \n\nafter taking perampanel. \n- If you are allergic to perampanel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fycompa if you have liver problems or moderate or \nsevere kidney problems. \nYou should not take Fycompa if you have serious liver problems or moderate or serious kidney \nproblems. \nBefore taking this medicine you should tell your doctor if you have a history of alcoholism or drug \ndependence. \n\n\n\n 80 \n\nCases of increased liver enzymes have been reported in some patients taking Fycompa in combination \nwith other antiepileptic drugs. \n \n- Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. \n- Fycompa may make you more likely to fall over, particularly if you are an older person; this \n\nmight be due to your illness. \n- Fycompa may make you aggressive, angry or violent. It may also cause you to have unusual or \n\nextreme changes in behaviour or mood. \nIf any of these happens, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nA small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, contact your doctor straight away. \n \nSerious skin reactions including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and \nStevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been reported with the use of perampanel. \n- DRESS typically, although not exclusively, appears as flu-like symptoms and a rash with a high \n\nbody temperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type \nof white blood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. \n\n- Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) can appear initially as reddish target- like spots or circular \npatches often with central blisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and \neyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever \nand/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life- \nthreatening complications or be fatal. \n\n \nIf you experience any of the above after taking Fycompa (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \nChildren \nFycompa is not recommended for children aged under 4. The safety and effectiveness are not yet \nknown in children under 4 years of age for partial seizures and under 7 years of age in generalised \nseizures.  \n \nOther medicines and Fycompa \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Taking \nFycompa with certain other medicines may cause side effects or affect how they work. Do not start or \nstop other medicines without talking to your doctor or pharmacist. \n- Other anti-epileptic medicines, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin that are \n\nused to treat fits may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken \nthese medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. \n\n- Felbamate (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) may also affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you \nare taking or have recently taken this medicine as your dose may need to be adjusted. \n\n- Midazolam (a medicine used to stop prolonged, acute (sudden) convulsive seizures, for sedation \nand sleep problem) may be affected by Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking midazolam \nas your dose may need to be adjusted. \n\n- Some other medicines such as rifampicin (a medicine used to treat bacterial infections), \nhypericum (St. John’s Wort) (a medicine used to treat mild anxiety) and ketoconazole (a \nmedicine used to treat fungal infections) may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking \nor have recently taken these medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. \n\n- Hormonal contraceptives (including oral contraceptives, implants, injections, and patches) \n- Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make certain \n\nhormonal contraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other forms of \nsafe and effective contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You should \ncontinue doing this for one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may \nbe appropriate contraception for you. \n\n \n\n\n\n 81 \n\nFycompa with alcohol \nSpeak to your doctor before drinking alcohol. Be careful about consuming alcohol with epilepsy \nmedicines including Fycompa. \n- Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa can make you less alert and affect your ability to drive \n\nor use tools or machines. \n- Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa can also make any feelings of anger, confusion or \n\nsadness worse. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Do not stop treatment without first discussing it \nwith your doctor. \n- Fycompa is not recommended in pregnancy. \n- You must use a reliable method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are \n\nbeing treated with Fycompa. You should continue doing this for one month after stopping \ntreatment. Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make \ncertain hormonal contraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other \nforms of safe and effective contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You \nshould also do this for one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may \nbe appropriate contraception for you. \n\nIt is not known whether the ingredients of Fycompa can pass into breast milk. \nThe doctor will weigh up the benefit and risks to your baby of taking Fycompa while you are \nbreast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machines until you know how Fycompa affects you. \nYou must talk to your doctor about the effect of your epilepsy on driving and using machines. \n- Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. If this \n\nhappens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n- Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa may make these effects worse. \n \nFycompa contains sorbitol \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking Fycompa. \n \nTaking Fycompa with other anti-epileptic medicine, which contains sorbitol, may affect how much \nthey work. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other anti-epileptic medicine(s) with \nsorbitol. \n \n \n3. How to use Fycompa \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nHow much to take \n \nAdults, adolescents (aged 12 years and older) in treating partial seizures and generalised seizures: \n \nThe usual starting dose is 2 mg (4 ml) once a day before you go to bed. \n- Your doctor may increase this in 2 mg (4 ml) steps to a maintenance dose between 4 mg (8 ml) \n\nand 12 mg (24 ml) depending on your response. \n- If you have mild or moderate liver problems, your dose should not be more than 8 mg each day \n\nand your dose increases should be at least 2 weeks apart. \n- Don’t take more Fycompa than your doctor has recommended.
