NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZoledronic acid Mylan 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial with 5 ml concentrate contains 4 mg zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). \n \nOne ml concentrate contains 0.8 mg zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1. Therapeutic indications \n \n- Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or \n\nsurgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced \nmalignancies involving bone. \n\n- Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). \n \n4.2. Posology and method of administration \n \nZoledronic acid Mylan must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare \nprofessionals experienced in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients treated with \nZoledronic acid Mylan should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. \n \nPosology \nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone \nAdults and elderly people \nThe recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced \nmalignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks. \n \nPatients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D \ndaily. \n \nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. \n \nTreatment of TIH \nAdults and elderly people \nThe recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 mg/dl or \n3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid.  \n \nRenal impairment \nTIH: \nZoledronic acid treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered \nonly after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\ncreatinine > 400 μmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH \npatients with serum creatinine < 400 μmol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). \n \nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone: \nWhen initiating treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone \nlesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. \nCLcr is calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zoledronic acid is not \nrecommended for patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which \nis defined for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with zoledronic acid, patients with \nserum creatinine > 265 μmol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. \n \nIn patients with bone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation \nof therapy, which is defined for this population as CLcr 30-60 ml/min, the following zoledronic acid \ndose is recommended (see also section 4.4): \n \n\nBaseline creatinine clearance (ml/min) Zoledronic acid recommended dose* \n> 60 4.0 mg zoledronic acid \n\n50-60 3.5 mg* zoledronic acid \n40-49 3.3 mg* zoledronic acid \n30-39 3.0 mg* zoledronic acid \n\n*Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr=75 ml/min). The reduced \ndoses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in patients \nwith creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. \n \nFollowing initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of zoledronic \nacid and treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, renal \ndeterioration was defined as follows: \n- For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 μmol/l), an increase of \n\n0.5 mg/dl or 44 μmol/l; \n- For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 μmol/l), an increase of \n\n1.0 mg/dl or 88 μmol/l. \n \nIn the clinical studies, zoledronic acid treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned \nto within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at \nthe same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nIntravenous use. \nZoledronic acid Mylan 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, further diluted in 100 ml (see \nsection 6.6), should be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes. \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced zoledronic acid doses are recommended \n(see section “Posology” above and section 4.4). \n \nInstructions for preparing reduced doses of Zoledronic acid Mylan \nWithdraw an appropriate volume of the concentrate needed, as follows: \n- 4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose \n- 4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose \n- 3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nFor instructions on the dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The \nwithdrawn amount of concentrate must be further diluted in 100 ml of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection or 5% w/v glucose solution. The dose must be given as a single \nintravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes. \n \nZoledronic acid Mylan concentrate must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent \ncation-containing infusion solutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution, and should be administered as \na single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. \n \nPatients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of zoledronic acid. \n \n4.3. Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1 \n Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n \n4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nPatients must be assessed prior to administration of zoledronic acid to ensure that they are adequately \nhydrated. \n \nOverhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. \n \nStandard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate \nand magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating zoledronic acid therapy. If \nhypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy \nmay be necessary. Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function \nimpairment, therefore careful renal function monitoring should be considered. \n \nZoledronic acid Mylan contains the same active substance as found in medicinal products indicated for \ntreatment of osteoporosis and Paget´s disease of the bone. Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid \nMylan should not be treated with such medicinal products or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, \nsince the combined effects of these agents are unknown. \n \nRenal insufficiency \nPatients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated \nwith consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with zoledronic acid \noutweighs the possible risk. \nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. \n \nZoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the \npotential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, \nmultiple cycles of zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products. While the risk is reduced with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over \n15 minutes, deterioration in renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal \nfailure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg \nzoledronic acid. Increases in serum creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration \nof zoledronic acid at recommended doses for prevention of skeletal related events, although less \nfrequently. \n \nPatients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of zoledronic acid. Upon \ninitiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower \ndoses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration \nduring treatment, zoledronic acid should be withheld. Zoledronic acid should only be resumed when \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nserum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline. Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at the \nsame dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. \n \nIn view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in \npatients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine ≥ 400 μmol/l or \n≥ 4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and ≥ 265 μmol/l or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone \nmetastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe \nrenal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of zoledronic acid is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nHepatic insufficiency \nAs only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific \nrecommendations can be given for this patient population. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials and in the post \nmarketing setting in patients receiving zoledronic acid.  \n \nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical emergency situations. A dental examination \nwith appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior \nto treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors. \n \nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual’s risk of developing \nONJ: \n- Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of \n\nadministration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of \nbisphosphonate. \n\n- Cancer, co morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n- Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to \n\nneck and head, corticosteroids. \n- History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures \n\n(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures. \n \nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with Zoledronic acid Mylan. \n \nWhile on treatment, invasive dental procedures should be performed only after careful consideration \nand be avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid administration. For patients who develop \nosteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the \ncondition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether \ndiscontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.  \n \nThe management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between \nthe treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \nfactors are mitigated where possible. \n \nOsteonecrosis of other anatomical sites \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nAdditionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and \nfemur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with zoledronic acid. \n \nMusculoskeletal pain \nIn post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain \nhave been reported in patients taking zoledronic acid. However, such reports have been infrequent. \nThe time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment. Most \npatients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when \nrechallenged with zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n \nHypocalcaemia \nHypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Cardiac arrhythmias and \nneurologic adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported \nsecondary to cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation \nhave been reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). \nCaution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with medicinal products known to cause \nhypocalcaemia, as they may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section \n4.5). Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating \nzoledronic acid therapy. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. \n \nZoledronic acid Mylan contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’.  \n \n4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn clinical studies, zoledronic acid has been administered concomitantly with commonly used \nanticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions \noccurring. Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit \nhuman P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been \nperformed.  \n \nCaution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop \ndiuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for \nlonger periods than required (see section 4.4).  \n \nCaution is indicated when zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal \nproducts. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during \ntreatment. \n \nIn multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when zoledronic acid is \nused in combination with thalidomide. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nCaution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal products as an \nincrease in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly with these \nmedicinal products. \n \n4.6. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction \nstudies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. Zoledronic acid should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing \npotential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zoledronic acid is \ncontraindicated in breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and \nF1 generation. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the \ncompound’s inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \ndetermining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7. Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of Zoledronic acid Mylan along with \ndriving and operating of machinery.  \n \n4.8. Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nWithin three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has commonly been \nreported, with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis \nwith subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of \nselected adverse reactions). \n \nThe following are the important identified risks with zoledronic acid in the approved indications: \nRenal function impairment, osteonecrosis of the jaw, acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia, atrial \nfibrillation, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease. The frequencies for each of these identified risks are \nshown in Table 1. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions, listed in Table 1, have been accumulated from clinical studies and \npost-marketing reports following predominantly chronic treatment with 4 mg zoledronic acid: \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nTable 1 \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \nconvention: Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon: Anaemia \nUncommon: Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia \nRare: Pancytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reaction \nRare: Angioneurotic oedema \n\nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: Anxiety, sleep disturbance \nRare: Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders \nCommon: Headache \nUncommon: Dizziness, paraesthesia, dysgeusia, \n\nhypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, tremor, \nsomnolence \n\nVery rare: Convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany \n(secondary to hypocalcaemia) \n\nEye disorders \nCommon: Conjunctivitis \nUncommon: Blurred vision, scleritis and orbital \n\ninflammation \nRare: Uveitis \nVery rare: Episcleritis \n\nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: Hypertension, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, \n\nhypotension leading to syncope or circulatory \ncollapse \n\nRare: Bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia (secondary \nto hypocalcaemia) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea, cough, bronchoconstriction \nRare: Interstitial lung disease \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite \nUncommon: Diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, \n\ndyspepsia, stomatitis, dry mouth \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon: Pruritus, rash (including erythematous and \nmacular rash), increased sweating \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: Bone pain, myalgia, arthralgia, generalised \n\npain \nUncommon: Muscle spasms, osteonecrosis of the jaw \nVery rare: Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n\n(bisphosphonate class adverse reaction) and \nother anatomical sites including femur and \nhip \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon: Renal impairment \nUncommon: \nRare: \n\nAcute renal failure, haematuria, proteinuria \nAcquired Fanconi syndrome \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: Fever, flu-like syndrome (including fatigue, \n\nrigors, malaise and flushing) \nUncommon: Asthenia, peripheral oedema, injection site \n\nreactions (including pain, irritation, swelling, \ninduration), chest pain, weight increase, \nanaphylactic reaction/shock, urticaria \n\nRare: Arthritis and joint swelling as a symptom of \nacute phase reaction \n\nInvestigations \nVery common: Hypophosphataemia \nCommon: Blood creatinine and blood urea increased, \n\nhypocalcaemia \nUncommon: Hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia \nRare: Hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nRenal function impairment \nZoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety \ndata from zoledronic acid registration trials for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events \nsuspected to be related to zoledronic acid (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma \n(3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that \nmay increase the potential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal \nimpairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of \nnephrotoxic medicinal products or using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal \ndeterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial \ndose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). Many of \nthese patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection \nincluding osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions \nor other dental surgeries.  \n \nAtrial fibrillation \nIn one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nzoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), \nthe overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in \npatients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious \nadverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic \nacid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in \nother trials with zoledronic acid, including those with zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3-4 weeks in \noncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single \nclinical trial is unknown. \n \nAcute phase reaction \nThis adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, \nheadache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint \nswelling. The onset time is ≤ 3 days post-zoledronic acid infusion, and the reaction is also referred to \nusing the terms “flu-like” or “post-dose” symptoms. \nAtypical fractures of the femur \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nDuring post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphosphonate class adverse reaction).  \n \nHypocalcaemia-related ADRs \nHypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with zoledronic acid in the approved indications. Based \non the review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an \nassociation between zoledronic acid therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary \ndevelopment of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between \nhypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, \nhypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9. Overdose \n \nClinical experience with acute overdose of zoledronic acid is limited. The administration of doses up \nto 48 mg of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than \nthose recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment \n(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) \nabnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should \nbe administered as clinically indicated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: \nM05BA08 \n \nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor \nof osteoclastic bone resorption. \n \nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, \nbut the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In \nlong-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the \nformation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone. \n \nIn addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several \nanti-tumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone \ndisease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies: \n- In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow \n\nmicroenvironment, making it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and \nanti-pain activity. \n\n- In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on \ntumour cells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer medicinal products, \nanti-adhesion/invasion activity. \n\n \nClinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies \ninvolving bone \nThe first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to \nplacebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic \nacid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nevent (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of \nevents per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in \ndeveloping SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving \nzoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference \nreached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered \npathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. \nEfficacy results are provided in Table 2. \n \nIn a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg \nsignificantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by \n> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk \nreduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo.

The results demonstrated that zoledronic acid 4 mg showed comparable efficacy to 90 mg \npamidronate in the prevention of SREs.

Patients were \nevenly distributed between zoledronic acid-treated and placebo groups. \n \nThe SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The \nproportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic \nacid-treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first SRE \nwas not reached in the zoledronic acid-treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly \nprolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a \nmultiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo. \n \nIn the zoledronic acid-treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the \nBrief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, \nwhen compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below \nbaseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nFigure 1. Mean changes from baseline in BPI scores. Statistically significant differences are \nmarked (*p< 0.05) for between treatment comparisons (4 mg zoledronic acid vs. Placebo) \n \n\n \n \nClinical trial results in the treatment of TIH \nClinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic \nacid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose \nfinding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective \ndoses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2-2.5 mg. \n \nTo assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal \nmulticentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster \nnormalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and \n8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed: \n \nTable 5: Proportion of complete responders by day in the combined TIH studies \n \n Day 4 Day 7  Day 10 \nZoledronic acid 4 mg (N=86) 45.3% (p=0.104)  82.6% (p=0.005)*  88.4% (p=0.002)* \nZoledronic acid 8 mg (N=90) 55.6% (p=0.021)*  83.3% (p=0.010)*  86.7% (p=0.015)* \nPamidronate 90 mg (N=99) 33.3% 63.6%  69.7% \n*p-values compared to pamidronate. \n \nMedian time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected \nserum calcium ≥ 2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus \n17 days for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg \nzoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid \ndoses. \n \nIn clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, \n8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these \npatients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data \navailable allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nIn clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety \nprofile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was \nsimilar in types and severity. \n \nPaediatric population \nClinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to \n17 years \nThe effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) \nwith severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in \none international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment \ngroup, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening \nperiod during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In \nthe clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a \nmaximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg \nzoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was \nconducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly \nzoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year \nof treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral \ndensity (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but \nthe trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In \nparticular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse \nevents of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% \n(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe \nosteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was \ncomparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76). \nInterpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in \npatients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process. \n \nThe type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in \nadults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked \nunder headings of frequency, are presented in Table 6. The following conventional classification is \nused: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nTable 6: Adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta1 \n \nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon:  Headache \nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon:  Tachycardia \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nCommon:  Nasopharyngitis \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common:  Vomiting, nausea \nCommon:  Abdominal pain \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon:  Pain in extremities, arthralgia, musculoskeletal \n\npain \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common:  Pyrexia, fatigue \nCommon:  Acute phase reaction, pain \n\nInvestigations \nVery common:  Hypocalcaemia \nCommon:  Hypophosphataemia \n\n1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that these \ncases are consistent with the well established safety profile of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8) \n \nIn paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with \nmore pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in \ncomparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nthe treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2. Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \nwith bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose \nindependent. \n \nAfter initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly \nincreased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% \nof peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low \nconcentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28. \n \nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed \nby a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours. There was no \naccumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is \nnot metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the \nadministered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. \nFrom the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via \nthe kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, \nage, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease \nin zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the \nplasma concentration versus time curve. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nThe interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with \nother bisphosphonates. \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in \npatients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, \nshows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the \nfaeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. \n \nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \nrepresenting 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/min (range \n22 to 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with \ncreatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the \ncorresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a \npatient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). \n \nIn an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, \nwith a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to \n5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at \n2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid. \n \nSpecial populations \nPaediatric patients \nLimited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic \nacid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg \ndose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic \nacid systemic exposure. \n \n5.3. Preclinical safety data \n \nAcute toxicity \nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \nrats. \n \nSubchronic and chronic toxicity \nZoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to \ndogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously \nin rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2-3 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well \ntolerated. \n \nThe most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the \nmetaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the \ncompound’s pharmacological antiresorptive activity. \n \nThe safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal \nstudies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and \nmultiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06-0.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses \nequivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat \nadministration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid \nproduced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and \nlungs, and at intravenous injection sites. \n \nReproduction toxicity \nZoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg. Although no \nteratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was \nobserved at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential \nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential. \n \n \n6.

Incompatibilities \n \nTo avoid potential incompatibilities, Zoledronic acid Mylan concentrate is to be diluted with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% w/v glucose solution. \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion \nsolutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution, and should be administered as a single intravenous \nsolution in a separate infusion line. \n \nStudies with polyolefin bags (prefilled with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or \n5% w/v glucose solution), showed no incompatibility with Zoledronic acid Mylan. \n \n6.3. Shelf life \n \n2 years. \n \nAfter dilution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at 2°C-8°C \nand at 25°C after dilution in 100 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or \n5% w/v glucose solution (minimal concentration: 3 mg/100 ml; maximal concentration: 4 mg/100 ml). \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C-8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions. The refrigerated solution should then be equilibrated to room \ntemperature prior to administration. \n \n6.4. Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.  \n \n6.5.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nZoledronic acid Mylan 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n\nZoledronic acid \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \nKeep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \nIf you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Zoledronic acid Mylan is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic acid Mylan \n3. How Zoledronic acid Mylan is used \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zoledronic acid Mylan \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zoledronic acid Mylan is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in Zoledronic acid Mylan is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of \nsubstances called bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing \ndown the rate of bone change. It is used: \n- To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread \n\nof cancer from primary site to the bone). \n- To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the \n\npresence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the \nrelease of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced \nhypercalcaemia (TIH). \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic acid Mylan \n \nFollow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. \nYour doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zoledronic acid Mylan and will \ncheck your response to treatment at regular intervals. \n \nYou must not be given Zoledronic acid Mylan: \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n- if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which \n\nzoledronic acid belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Zoledronic acid Mylan: \n- if you have or have had a kidney problem. \n- if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the \n\njaw or loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start \ntreatment with Zoledronic acid Mylan.  \n\n- if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that \nyou are being treated with Zoledronic acid Mylan and inform your doctor about your dental \ntreatment. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nWhile being treated with Zoledronic acid Mylan, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including \nregular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. \n \nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a \ncondition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nPatients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are \nundergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are \nsmokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \ndisorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nReduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry \nskin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Irregular heart \nbeat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to \nsevere hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these \napply to you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be \ncorrected before initiating the first dose of zoledronic acid. You will be given adequate calcium and \nvitamin D supplements. \n \nPatients aged 65 years and over \nZoledronic acid Mylan can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest \nthat any extra precautions are needed. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nZoledronic acid Mylan is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of \n18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Zoledronic acid Mylan \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is \nespecially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: \n- Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used \n\nto treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to \ntreat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the \ncombination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become \ntoo low. \n\n- Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any \nother medicines which may harm your kidneys. \n\n- Other medicines that also contain zoledronic acid and which are used to treat osteoporosis and \nother non-cancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects \nof these medicines taken together with Zoledronic acid Mylan are unknown. \n\n- Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with zoledronic \nacid has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou should not be given Zoledronic acid Mylan if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or \nthink that you may be pregnant. \n \nYou must not be given Zoledronic acid Mylan if you are breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThere have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of zoledronic acid. You \nshould therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full \nattention. \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \nZoledronic acid Mylan contains sodium. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How Zoledronic acid Mylan is used \n \n- Zoledronic acid Mylan must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering \n\nbisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein. \n- Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent \n\ndehydration. \n- Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nHow much Zoledronic acid Mylan is given \n- The usual single dose given is 4 mg zoledronic acid. \n- If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity \n\nof your kidney problem. \n \nHow often you will be given Zoledronic acid Mylan \n- If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you \n\nwill be given one infusion of Zoledronic acid Mylan every three to four weeks. \n- If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only \n\nbe given one infusion of Zoledronic acid Mylan. \n \nHow Zoledronic acid Mylan is given \n- Zoledronic acid Mylan is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least \n\n15 minutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion \nline. \n\n \nPatients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D \nsupplements to be taken each day. \n \nIf you are given more Zoledronic acid Mylan than you should be \nIf you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your \ndoctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of \ncalcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney \nimpairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by \ninfusion. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most \ncommon ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time. \n \nTell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific \n\nblood tests). \n- Low level of calcium in the blood. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw, \n\ndischarge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could \nbe signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nyou experience such symptoms while being treated with Zoledronic acid Mylan or after \nstopping treatment. \n\n- Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for \npostmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this \nirregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms \nafter you have received zoledronic acid. \n\n- Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to \n\nhypocalcaemia). \n- A kidney function disorder called Fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your \n\ndoctor with certain urine tests). \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n- As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to \n\nhypocalcaemia). \n- Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These \n\ncould be signs of bone damage in the ear. \n Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially \n\nthe hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or \nworsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zoledronic acid Mylan or after \nstopping treatment. \n\n \nTell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- Low level of phosphate in the blood. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and \n\nbone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the \nsymptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). \n\n- Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. \n- Conjunctivitis. \n- Low level of red blood cells (anaemia). \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- Hypersensitivity reactions. \n- Low blood pressure. \n- Chest pain. \n- Skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching. \n- High blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, taste \n\ndisturbances, trembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhoea, constipation, \nabdominal pain, dry mouth. \n\n- Low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets. \n- Low level of magnesium and potassium in the blood. Your doctor will monitor this and take any \n\nnecessary measures. \n- Weight increase. \n- Increased sweating. \n- Sleepiness. \n- Blurred vision, tearing of the eye, eye sensitivity to light. \n- Sudden coldness with fainting, limpness or collapse. \n- Difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing. \n- Urticaria. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- Slow heart beat. \n- Confusion. \n- Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for \n\nosteoporosis may occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or \ndiscomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of \nthe thigh bone. \n\n- Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs). \n- Flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. \n- Painful redness and/or swelling of the eye. \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n- Fainting due to low blood pressure. \n- Severe bone, joint and/or muscle pain, occasionally incapacitating. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

If a lower \ndose of Zoledronic acid Mylan is required, first withdraw the appropriate volume as indicated \nbelow and then dilute it further with 100 ml of infusion solution. To avoid potential \nincompatibilities, the infusion solution used for dilution must be either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection or 5% w/v glucose solution. \n\n \nDo not mix Zoledronic acid Mylan concentrate with calcium-containing or other divalent \ncation-containing solutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution. \n \nInstructions for preparing reduced doses of Zoledronic acid Mylan: \nWithdraw the appropriate volume of the liquid concentrate, as follows: \n- 4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose \n- 4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose \n- 3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose \n \n- For single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from \n\nparticles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the \npreparation of the infusion. \n\n \n- From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution for infusion should be used \n\nimmediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C-8°C. The \nrefrigerated solution should then be equilibrated to room temperature prior to administration. \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at 2°C-8°C and at \n25°C after dilution in 100 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% w/v \nglucose solution (minimal concentration: 3 mg/100 ml; maximal concentration: 4 mg/100 ml). \n\n \n- The solution containing zoledronic acid is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a \n\nseparate infusion line. The hydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following \nadministration of Zoledronic acid Mylan to ensure that they are adequately hydrated. \n\n \n- Studies with polyolefin bags (prefilled with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or 5% w/v glucose solution), showed no incompatibility with Zoledronic acid Mylan. \n \n- Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zoledronic acid Mylan with other \n\nintravenously administered substances, Zoledronic acid Mylan must not be mixed with other \nmedicinal products/substances and should always be given through a separate infusion line. \n\n \nHow to store Zoledronic acid Mylan \n \n- Keep Zoledronic acid Mylan out of the sight and reach of children. \n- Do not use Zoledronic acid Mylan after the expiry date stated on the vial and carton after EXP. \n- The unopened vial does not require any specific storage conditions. \n- Storage conditions of the diluted solution are described in the above paragraph (See “How to \n\nprepare and administer Zoledronic acid Mylan”). \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
