PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet.  \n\n \n\nBosulif 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\nYellow oval (width: 5.6 mm; length: 10.7 mm) biconvex, film-coated tablet debossed with “Pfizer” on \n\none side and “100” on the other side. \n\n \n\nBosulif 400 mg film-coated tablets \n\nOrange oval (width: 8.8 mm; length: 16.9 mm) biconvex, film-coated tablet debossed with “Pfizer” on \n\none side and “400” on the other side. \n\n \n\nBosulif 500 mg film-coated tablets \n\nRed oval (width: 9.5 mm; length: 18.3 mm) biconvex, film-coated tablet debossed with “Pfizer” on \n\none side and “500” on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nBosulif is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: \n\n• newly-diagnosed chronic phase (CP) Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous \n\nleukaemia (Ph+ CML). \n\n• CP, accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) Ph+ CML previously treated with one or \n\nmore tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) [TKI(s)] and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are \n\nnot considered appropriate treatment options. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and the treatment of patients \n\nwith CML. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nNewly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML \n\nThe recommended dose is 400 mg bosutinib once daily. \n\n \n\nCP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy \n\nThe recommended dose is 500 mg bosutinib once daily. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials for both indications, treatment with bosutinib continued until disease progression or \n\nintolerance to therapy. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments \n\n \n\nIn the Phase 1/2 clinical study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, \n\ndose escalations from 500 mg to 600 mg once daily with food were allowed in patients who failed to \n\ndemonstrate complete haematological response (CHR) by Week 8 or complete cytogenetic response \n\n(CCyR) by Week 12 and did not have Grade 3 or higher adverse events possibly-related to the \n\ninvestigational product. Whereas, in the Phase 3 study in patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML \n\ntreated with bosutinib 400 mg, dose escalations by 100 mg increments to a maximum of 600 mg once \n\ndaily with food were permitted if the patient failed to demonstrate breakpoint cluster region-Abelson \n\n(BCR-ABL) transcripts ≤ 10% at Month 3, did not have a Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction at the time of \n\nescalation, and all Grade 2 non-haematological toxicities were resolved to at least Grade 1.  \n\n \n\nIn the Phase 1/2 clinical study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy \n\nwho started treatment at ≤ 500 mg, 93 (93/558; 16.7%) patients had dose escalations to 600 mg daily.  \n\n \n\nIn the Phase 3 study in patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML who started bosutinib treatment at \n\n400 mg, a total of 46 patients (17.2%) received dose escalations to 500 mg. In addition, 5.6% of \n\npatients in the bosutinib treatment group had further dose escalations to 600 mg. \n\n \n\nDoses greater than 600 mg/day have not been studied and, therefore, should not be given. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments for adverse reactions \n\n \n\nNon-haematological adverse reactions \n\nIf clinically significant moderate or severe non-haematological toxicity develops, bosutinib should be \n\ninterrupted, and may be resumed at a dose reduced by 100 mg taken once daily after the toxicity has \n\nresolved. If clinically appropriate, re-escalation to the dose prior to the dose reduction taken once daily \n\nshould be considered (see section 4.4). Doses less than 300 mg/day have been used in patients; \n\nhowever, efficacy has not been established. \n\n \n\nElevated liver transaminases: If elevations in liver transaminases > 5 × institutional upper limit of \n\nnormal (ULN) occur, bosutinib should be interrupted until recovery to ≤ 2.5 × ULN and may be \n\nresumed at 400 mg once daily thereafter. If recovery takes longer than 4 weeks, discontinuation of \n\nbosutinib should be considered. If transaminase elevations ≥ 3 × ULN occur concurrently with \n\nbilirubin elevations > 2 × ULN and alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN, bosutinib should be discontinued \n\n(see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea: For NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3-4 \n\ndiarrhoea, bosutinib should be interrupted and may be resumed at 400 mg once daily upon recovery to \n\ngrade ≤ 1 (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHaematological adverse reactions \n\nDose reductions are recommended for severe or persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as \n\ndescribed in Table 1: \n\n \n\nTable 1 – Dose adjustments for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nANCa < 1.0 × 109/L  \n\n \n\nand/or \n\n \n\nPlatelets < 50 × 109/L \n\nHold bosutinib until ANC  1.0 × 109/L and platelets \n\n 50 × 109/L. \n\n \n\nResume treatment with bosutinib at the same dose if recovery \n\noccurs within 2 weeks. If blood counts remain low for \n\n> 2 weeks, upon recovery reduce dose by 100 mg and resume \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nIf cytopoenia recurs, reduce dose by an additional 100 mg upon \n\nrecovery and resume treatment.  \n\n \n\nDoses less than 300 mg/day have been used; however, efficacy \n\nhas not been established. \na ANC = absolute neutrophil count \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) \n\nNo specific dose recommendation is necessary in the elderly. Since there is limited information in the \n\nelderly, caution should be exercised in these patients. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\nPatients with serum creatinine > 1.5×ULN were excluded from CML studies. Increasing exposure \n\n(area under curve [AUC]) in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment during studies was \n\nobserved.  \n\n \n\nNewly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML \n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLCr] 30 to 50 mL/min, estimated \n\nby the Cockcroft-Gault formula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 300 mg daily with food (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (CLCr < 30 mL/min, estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault \n\nformula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 200 mg daily with food (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nDose escalation to 400 mg once daily with food for patients with moderate renal impairment or to \n\n300 mg once daily for patients with severe renal impairment may be considered if they do not \n\nexperience severe or persistent moderate adverse reactions and if they do not achieve an adequate \n\nhaematological, cytogenetic, or molecular response. \n \n\nCP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy \n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (CLCr 30 to 50 mL/min, calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault \n\nformula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 400 mg daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (CLCr < 30 mL/min, calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault \n\nformula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 300 mg daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nDose escalation to 500 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment or to 400 mg once \n\ndaily in patients with severe renal impairment may be considered in those who did not experience \n\nsevere or persistent moderate adverse reactions, and if they do not achieve an adequate \n\nhaematological, cytogenetic, or molecular response. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nIn clinical studies, patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease (e.g., recent myocardial \n\ninfarction, congestive heart failure or unstable angina) were excluded. Caution should be exercised in \n\npatients with relevant cardiac disorders (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRecent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder \n\nIn clinical studies, patients with recent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder \n\n(e.g., severe vomiting and/or diarrhoea) were excluded. Caution should be exercised in patients with \n\nrecent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of bosutinib in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not \n\nbeen established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nBosulif should be taken orally once daily with food (see section 5.2). If a dose is missed by more than \n\n12 hours, the patient should not be given an additional dose. The patient should take the usual \n\nprescribed dose on the following day. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nLiver function abnormalities \n\nTreatment with bosutinib is associated with elevations in serum transaminases (alanine \n\naminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). \n\n \n\nTransaminase elevations generally occurred early in the course of treatment (of the patients who \n\nexperienced transaminase elevations of any grade, > 80% experienced their first event within the first \n\n3 months). Patients receiving bosutinib should have liver function tests prior to treatment initiation and \n\nmonthly for the first 3 months of treatment, and as clinically indicated.  \n\n \n\nPatients with transaminase elevations should be managed by withholding bosutinib temporarily (with \n\nconsideration given to dose reduction after recovery to Grade 1 or baseline), and/or discontinuation of \n\nbosutinib. Elevations of transaminases, particularly in the setting of concomitant increases in bilirubin, \n\nmay be an early indication of drug-induced liver injury and these patients should be managed \n\nappropriately (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea and vomiting \n\nTreatment with bosutinib is associated with diarrhoea and vomiting; therefore, patients with recent or \n\nongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder should use this medicinal product with caution \n\nand only after a careful benefit-risk assessment as respective patients were excluded from the clinical \n\nstudies. Patients with diarrhoea and vomiting should be managed using standard-of-care treatment, \n\nincluding an antidiarrhoeal or antiemetic medicinal product and/or fluid replacement. In addition, \n\ndiarrhoea and vomiting can also be managed by withholding bosutinib temporarily, dose reduction, \n\nand/or discontinuation of bosutinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). The antiemetic agent, domperidone, has \n\nthe potential to increase QT interval (QTc) prolongation and to induce “torsade de pointes”- \n\narrhythmias; therefore, co-administration with domperidone should be avoided. It should only be used, \n\nif other medicinal products are not efficacious. In these situations an individual benefit-risk assessment \n\nis mandatory and patients should be monitored for occurrence of QTc prolongation. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMyelosuppression \n\nTreatment with bosutinib is associated with myelosuppression, defined as anaemia, neutropenia, and \n\nthrombocytopenia. Complete blood counts should be performed weekly for the first month and then \n\nmonthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression should/can be managed by \n\nwithholding bosutinib temporarily, dose reduction, and/or discontinuation of bosutinib (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nFluid retention \n\nTreatment with bosutinib may be associated with fluid retention including pericardial effusion, pleural \n\neffusion, pulmonary oedema and/or peripheral oedema. Patients should be monitored and managed \n\nusing standard-of-care treatment. In addition, fluid retention can also be managed by withholding \n\nbosutinib temporarily, dose reduction, and/or discontinuation of bosutinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nSerum lipase  \n\nElevation in serum lipase has been observed. Caution is recommended in patients with previous \n\nhistory of pancreatitis. In case lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, bosutinib \n\nshould be interrupted and appropriate diagnostic measures considered to exclude pancreatitis (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nInfections  \n\nBosutinib may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoan infections. \n\n \n\nProarrhythmic potential \n\nAutomated machine-read QTc prolongation without accompanying arrhythmia has been observed. \n\nBosutinib should be administered with caution to patients who have a history of or predisposition for \n\nQTc prolongation, who have uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial \n\ninfarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia, or who are \n\ntaking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc (e.g., anti-arrhythmic medicinal products \n\nand other substances that may prolong QTc [see section 4.5]). The presence of hypokalaemia and \n\nhypomagnesaemia may further enhance this effect. \n\n \n\nMonitoring for an effect on the QTc is advisable and a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is \n\nrecommended prior to initiating therapy with bosutinib and as clinically indicated. Hypokalaemia or \n\nhypomagnesaemia must be corrected prior to bosutinib administration and should be monitored \n\nperiodically during therapy. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nTreatment with bosutinib may result in a clinically significant decline in renal function in CML \n\npatients. A decline over time in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been observed in \n\npatients treated with bosutinib in clinical studies. In patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML treated \n\nwith 400 mg, the median decline from baseline in eGFR was 4.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 3 months, \n\n9.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 6 months and 11.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 12 months. Treatment-naïve CML patients \n\ntreated with 500 mg showed a median eGFR decline of 5.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 3 months, of \n\n9.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 12 months and of up to 16.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 until 5 years follow-up for patients \n\non treatment. Pre-treated and advanced stage CML patients on 500 mg showed a median eGFR decline \n\nof 5.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 3 months, of 7.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 12 months and of up to \n\n10.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 in up to 4 years on treatment. It is important that renal function is assessed prior \n\nto treatment initiation and closely monitored during therapy with bosutinib, with particular attention in \n\nthose patients who have pre-existing renal compromise or in those patients exhibiting risk factors for \n\nrenal dysfunction, including concomitant use of medicinal products with potential for nephrotoxicity, \n\nsuch as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and \n\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n\n \n\nIn a renal impairment study, bosutinib exposures were increased in subjects with moderately and \n\nseverely impaired renal function. Dose reduction is recommended for patients with moderate or severe \n\nrenal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nPatients with serum creatinine > 1.5 × ULN were excluded from the CML studies. Based on a \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis increasing exposure (AUC) in patients with moderate and severe \n\nrenal impairment at initiation of treatment during studies was observed (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nClinical data are very limited (n = 3) for CML patients with moderate renal impairment receiving an \n\nescalated dose of 600 mg bosutinib. \n\n \n\nAsian race \n\nAccording to population pharmacokinetic analyses, Asians had a lower clearance resulting in \n\nincreased exposure. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions \n\nespecially in case of dose escalation. \n\n \n\nSevere skin reactions \n\nBosutinib can induce severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal \n\nNecrolysis. Bosutinib should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a severe skin \n\nreaction during treatment. \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome  \n\nDue to the possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), correction of clinically significant \n\ndehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of bosutinib \n\n(see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after \n\nthese patients received BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or fulminant \n\nhepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome.  \n\n \n\nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with bosutinib. Experts in liver \n\ndisease and in the treatment of HBV should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \n\npositive HBV serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test positive for \n\nHBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with bosutinib should be \n\nclosely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several \n\nmonths following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity  \n\nExposure to direct sunlight or ultraviolet (UV) radiation should be avoided or minimised due to the \n\nrisk of photosensitivity associated with bosutinib treatment. Patients should be instructed to use \n\nmeasures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF).  \n\n \n\nCytochrome P-450 (CYP)3A inhibitors \n\nThe concomitant use of bosutinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided, as an \n\nincrease in bosutinib plasma concentration will occur (see section 4.5).  \n\n \n\nSelection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal CYP3A inhibition \n\npotential, if possible, is recommended. \n\n \n\nIf a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be administered during bosutinib treatment, an \n\ninterruption of bosutinib therapy or a dose reduction in bosutinib should be considered. \n\n \n\nCYP3A inducers \n\nThe concomitant use of bosutinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided as a \n\ndecrease in bosutinib plasma concentration will occur (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFood effect \n\nGrapefruit products, including grapefruit juice and other foods that are known to inhibit CYP3A \n\nshould be avoided (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nDietary sodium \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg, 400 mg, or 500 mg \n\ntablet. Patients on low sodium diets should be informed that this product is essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on bosutinib \n\n \n\nCYP3A inhibitors \n\nThe concomitant use of bosutinib with strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to \n\nitraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, \n\nmibefradil, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, \n\ngrapefruit products including grapefruit juice) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not \n\nlimited to fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, amprenavir, atazanavir, \n\ndarunavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir, aprepitant, crizotinib, imatinib) should be avoided, as an increase \n\nin bosutinib plasma concentration will occur.  \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised if mild CYP3A inhibitors are used concomitantly with bosutinib. \n\n \n\nSelection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal CYP3A enzyme \n\ninhibition potential, if possible, is recommended. \n\n \n\nIf a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be administered during bosutinib treatment, an \n\ninterruption of bosutinib therapy or a dose reduction in bosutinib should be considered. \n\n \n\nIn a study of 24 healthy subjects in whom 5 daily doses of 400 mg ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A \n\ninhibitor) were co-administered with a single dose of 100 mg bosutinib under fasting conditions, \n\nketoconazole increased bosutinib Cmax by 5.2-fold, and bosutinib AUC in plasma by 8.6-fold, as \n\ncompared with administration of bosutinib alone. \n\n \n\nIn a study of 20 healthy subjects, in whom a single dose of 125 mg aprepitant (a moderate CYP3A \n\ninhibitor) was co-administered with a single dose of 500 mg bosutinib under fed conditions, aprepitant \n\nincreased bosutinib Cmax by 1.5-fold, and bosutinib AUC in plasma by 2.0-fold, as compared with \n\nadministration of bosutinib alone. \n\n \n\nCYP3A inducers  \n\nThe concomitant use of bosutinib with strong CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to \n\ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, St. John’s Wort), or moderate CYP3A inducers (including, but \n\nnot limited to bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) should be avoided, as a decrease in \n\nbosutinib plasma concentration will occur.  \n\n \n\nBased on the large reduction in bosutinib exposure that occurred when bosutinib was co-administered \n\nwith rifampicin, increasing the dose of bosutinib when co-administering with strong or moderate \n\nCYP3A inducers is unlikely to sufficiently compensate for the loss of exposure. \n\n \n\nCaution is warranted if mild CYP3A inducers are used concomitantly with bosutinib.  \n\n \n\nFollowing concomitant administration of a single dose bosutinib with 6 daily doses of 600 mg \n\nrifampicin, in 24 healthy subjects in fed state bosutinib exposure (Cmax and AUC in plasma) decreased \n\nto 14% and 6%, respectively, of the values when bosutinib 500 mg was administered alone. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \n\nCaution should be exercised when administering bosutinib concomitantly with PPIs. Short-acting \n\nantacids should be considered as an alternative to PPIs and administration times of bosutinib and \n\nantacids should be separated (i.e. take bosutinib in the morning and antacids in the evening) whenever \n\npossible. Bosutinib displays pH-dependent aqueous solubility in vitro. When a single oral dose of \n\nbosutinib (400 mg) was co-administered with multiple-oral doses of lansoprazole (60 mg) in a study of \n\n24 healthy fasting subjects, bosutinib Cmax and AUC decreased to 54% and 74%, respectively, of the \n\nvalues seen when bosutinib (400 mg) was given alone. \n \n\nEffects of bosutinib on other medicinal products \n\nIn a study of 27 healthy subjects, in whom a single dose of 500 mg bosutinib was co-administered \n\nwith a single dose of 150 mg dabigatran etexilate mesylate (a P-glycoprotein [P-gp] substrate) under \n\nfed conditions, bosutinib did not increase Cmax or AUC of dabigatran in plasma, as compared with \n\nadministration of dabigatran etexilate mesylate alone. The study results indicate that bosutinib does \n\nnot exhibit clinically relevant P-gp inhibitory effects.  \n\n \n\nAn in vitro study indicates that drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur at therapeutic doses as a \n\nresult of induction by bosutinib on the metabolism of medicinal products that are substrates for \n\nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that clinical drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur at therapeutic doses \n\nas a result of inhibition by bosutinib on the metabolism of medicinal products that are substrates for \n\nCYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that bosutinib has a low potential to inhibit breast cancer resistance protein \n\n(BCRP, systemically), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic anion \n\ntransporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2 at clinically relevant concentrations, \n\nbut may have the potential to inhibit BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract and OCT1. \n\n \n\nAnti-arrhythmic medicinal products and other substances that may prolong QT  \n\nBosutinib should be used with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of QT, \n\nincluding those patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as amiodarone, disopyramide, \n\nprocainamide, quinidine and sotalol or other medicinal products that may lead to QT prolongation \n\nsuch as chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, domperidone, haloperidol, methadone, and \n\nmoxifloxacin (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \n\nwith bosutinib and for at least 1 month after the last dose and to avoid becoming pregnant while \n\nreceiving bosutinib. In addition, the patient should be advised that vomiting or diarrhoea may reduce \n\nthe efficacy of oral contraceptives by preventing full absorption. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are limited amount of data in pregnant women from the use of bosutinib. Studies in animals \n\nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Bosutinib is not recommended for use during \n\npregnancy, or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If bosutinib is used during \n\npregnancy, or the patient becomes pregnant while taking bosutinib, she should be apprised of the \n\npotential hazard to the foetus. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether bosutinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A study of [14C] \n\nradiolabelled bosutinib in rats demonstrated excretion of bosutinib-derived radioactivity in breast milk \n\n(see section 5.3). A potential risk to the breast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding \n\nshould be discontinued during treatment with bosutinib. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nBased on non-clinical findings, bosutinib has the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility \n\nin humans (see section 5.3). Men being treated with bosutinib are advised to seek advice on \n\nconservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of decreased fertility due to therapy \n\nwith bosutinib. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nBosutinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, if a patient \n\ntaking bosutinib experiences dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment or other undesirable effects with a \n\npotential impact on the ability to drive or use machines safely, the patient should refrain from these \n\nactivities for as long as the undesirable effects persist.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\nA total of 1,272 leukaemia patients received at least 1 dose of single-agent bosutinib. The median \n\nduration of therapy was 13.8 months (range: 0.03 to 123.3 months). These patients were either \n\nnewly-diagnosed, with CP CML or were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy with chronic, \n\naccelerated, or blast phase CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Of these patients, \n\n268 (400 mg starting dose) and 248 (500 mg starting dose) are from the 2 Phase 3 studies in \n\npreviously untreated CML patients, 570 and 63 are from 2 Phase 1/2 studies in previously treated \n\nPh+ leukaemias, and 123 patients from a Phase 4 study in previously treated CML. The median \n\nduration of therapy was 14.1 months (range: 0.3 to 24.7 months), 61.6 months (0.03 to 99.6 months), \n\n11.1 months (range: 0.03 to 123.3 months), 30.2 months (range: 0.3 to 85.6 months), and 5.7 months \n\n(range: 0.07 to 17.8 months), respectively. The safety analyses included data from an ongoing \n\nextension study.   \n\n \n\nAt least 1 adverse reaction of any toxicity grade was reported for 1,240 (97.5%) patients. The most \n\nfrequent adverse reactions reported for  20% of patients were diarrhoea (78.1%), nausea (40.8%), \n\nthrombocytopenia (34.9%), abdominal pain (34.0%), vomiting (33.0%), rash (31.5%), anaemia \n\n(25.6%), pyrexia (21.8%), fatigue (21.4%), and ALT increased (25.0%). At least 1 Grade 3 or Grade 4 \n\nadverse reaction was reported for 814 (63.9%) patients. The Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse reactions \n\nreported for  5% of patients were thrombocytopenia (20.3%), anaemia (10.2%), neutropenia (10.5%), \n\nALT increased (12.7%), diarrhoea (9.6%), rash (5.0%), lipase increased (8.2%), and AST increased \n\n(5.8%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following adverse reactions were reported in patients in bosutinib clinical studies (Table 2). These \n\nrepresent an evaluation of the adverse reaction data from 1,272 patients with either newly-diagnosed \n\nCP CML or with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase CML resistant or intolerant to prior therapy or \n\nPh+ ALL who have received at least 1 dose of single-agent bosutinib. These adverse reactions are \n\npresented by system organ class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common \n\n( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare ( 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

In these patients, the maximum toxicity of Grade 1 or 2 was experienced in \n\n174 (58%) patients, Grade 3 in 96 patients (32%), and Grade 4 in 27 (9%) patients. Among these \n\npatients, the median time to first event was 28 days (range: 1 to 2,633 days) and the median duration \n\nper event was 15 days (range: 1 to 1,529 days).  \n\n \n\nOf the 197 (15%) patients with reports of adverse reactions of neutropenia, 15 patients discontinued \n\nbosutinib due to neutropenia. Maximum Grade 1 or 2 events were experienced by 63 (32%) patients. \n\nThe maximum toxicity of Grade 3 neutropenia was experienced in 90 (46%) patients and of Grade 4 in \n\n44 (22%) patients. The median time to first event was 59 days (range: 27 to 505 days), and the median \n\nduration per event was 15 days (range: 1 to 913 days).  \n\n \n\nOf the 445 (35%) patients with reports of adverse reactions of thrombocytopenia, 41 (9%) patients \n\ndiscontinued treatment with bosutinib due to thrombocytopenia. Maximum Grade 1 or 2 events were \n\nexperienced by 186 (42%) patients. The maximum toxicity of thrombocytopenia of Grade 3 was \n\nexperienced in 161 (36%) patients and Grade 4 in 98 (22%) patients. Among patients with \n\nthrombocytopenia reactions, the median time to first event was 28 days (range: 1 to 1,688 days), and \n\nmedian duration per event was 15 days (range: 1 to 1,762 days). \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nAmong patients with reports of adverse reactions of elevations in either ALT or AST (all grades), the \n\nmedian time of onset observed was 29 days with a range of onset 1 to 2,465 days for ALT and AST. \n\nThe median duration of an event was 18 days (range: 1 to 775 days), and 15 days (range: 1 to \n\n803 days) for ALT and AST, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn the entire development program, concurrent elevation in transaminases ≥ 3 × ULN and bilirubin \n\n> 2 × ULN with alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN occurred without alternative causes in \n\n1/1,611 (< 0.1%) subjects treated with bosutinib. This finding was in a study of bosutinib in \n\ncombination with letrozole in a patient with metastatic breast cancer. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in \n\nacute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nOf the 994 (78%) patients that experienced diarrhoea, 10 patients discontinued bosutinib due to this \n\nevent. Concomitant medicinal products were given to treat diarrhoea in 662 (66%) patients. The \n\nmaximum toxicity of diarrhoea was Grade 1 or 2 in 88% of patients, Grade 3 in 12% of patients; \n\n1 patient (< 1%) experienced a Grade 4 event. Among patients with diarrhoea, the median time to first \n\nevent was 2 days (range: 1 to 2,415 days) and the median duration of any grade of diarrhoea was \n\n2 days (range: 1 to 2,511 days). \n\n  \n\nAmong the 994 patients with diarrhoea, 180 patients (18%) were managed with treatment interruption \n\nand of these 170 (94%) were rechallenged with bosutinib. Of those who were rechallenged, 167 (98%) \n\ndid not have a subsequent event or did not discontinue bosutinib due to a subsequent event of \n\ndiarrhoea. \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nFour patients (0.3%) experienced QTcF interval prolongation (greater than 500 ms). Nine (0.8%) \n\npatients experienced QTcF increase from baseline exceeding 60 ms. Patients with uncontrolled or \n\nsignificant cardiovascular disease including QTc prolongation, at baseline, were not included in \n\nclinical studies (see sections 5.1 and 5.3).  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nExperience with bosutinib overdose in clinical studies was limited to isolated cases. Patients who take \n\nan overdose of bosutinib should be observed and given appropriate supportive treatment. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE14. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nBosutinib belongs to a pharmacological class of medicinal products known as kinase inhibitors. \n\nBosutinib inhibits the abnormal BCR-ABL kinase that promotes CML. Modeling studies indicate that \n\nbosutinib binds the kinase domain of BCR-ABL. Bosutinib is also an inhibitor of Src family kinases \n\nincluding Src, Lyn and Hck. Bosutinib minimally inhibits platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) \n\nreceptor and c-Kit. \n\n \n\nIn in vitro studies, bosutinib inhibits proliferation and survival of established CML cell lines, \n\nPh+ ALL cell lines, and patient-derived primary primitive CML cells. Bosutinib inhibited 16 of \n\n18 imatinib-resistant forms of BCR-ABL expressed in murine myeloid cell lines. Bosutinib treatment \n\nreduced the size of CML tumours growing in nude mice and inhibited growth of murine myeloid \n\ntumours expressing imatinib-resistant forms of BCR-ABL. Bosutinib also inhibits receptor tyrosine \n\nkinases c-Fms, EphA and B receptors, Trk family kinases, Axl family kinases, Tec family kinases, \n\n\n\n14 \n\nsome members of the ErbB family, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Csk, serine/threonine kinases of \n\nthe Ste20 family, and 2 calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nThe effect of bosutinib 500 mg administration on corrected QTc was evaluated in a randomised, \n\nsingle-dose, double-blind (with respect to bosutinib), crossover, placebo- and open-label \n\nmoxifloxacin-controlled study in healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nThe data from this study indicate that bosutinib does not prolong the QTc in healthy subjects at the \n\ndose of 500 mg daily with food, and under conditions that give rise to supratherapeutic plasma \n\nconcentrations. Following administration of a single oral dose of bosutinib 500 mg (therapeutic dose) \n\nand bosutinib 500 mg with ketoconazole 400 mg (to achieve supratherapeutic concentrations of \n\nbosutinib) in healthy subjects, the upper bound of the 1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) around the \n\nmean change in QTc was less than 10 ms at all post-dose time points, and no adverse events \n\nsuggestive of QTc prolongation were observed. \n\n \n\nIn a study in liver impaired subjects, an increasing frequency of QTc prolongation > 450 ms with \n\ndeclining hepatic function was observed. In the Phase 1/2 clinical study in patients with previously \n\ntreated Ph+ leukaemias, QTcF interval changes > 60 ms from baseline were observed in 6 (1.1%) of \n\n562 patients. In the Phase 3 clinical study in patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML treated with \n\nbosutinib 400 mg, there were no patients in the bosutinib treatment group with an increase of > 60 ms \n\nfrom baseline when the QT interval was corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF). In the Phase 3 \n\nclinical study in patients with newly-diagnosed Ph+ CP CML treated with bosutinib 500 mg, QTcF \n\ninterval changes > 60 ms from baseline were observed in 2 (0.8%) of 248 patients receiving bosutinib. \n\nA proarrhythmic potential of bosutinib cannot be ruled out. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nClinical study in CP previously untreated CML \n\n \n\nBosutinib 400 mg study \n\nA 2-arm, Phase 3, open-label, multicentre superiority trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy \n\nand safety of bosutinib 400 mg once daily alone compared with imatinib 400 mg once daily alone in \n\nadult patients with newly-diagnosed Ph+ CP CML. The trial randomised 536 patients (268 in each \n\ntreatment group) with Ph+ or Ph- newly-diagnosed CP CML (intent-to-treat population [ITT]) \n\nincluding 487 patients with Ph+ CML harbouring b2a2 and/or b3a2 transcripts and baseline \n\nBCR-ABL copies > 0 (modified intent-to-treat [mITT] population). \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion demonstrating a major molecular response (MMR) \n\nat 12 months (48 weeks) in the bosutinib treatment group compared with that in the imatinib treatment \n\ngroup in the mITT population. MMR was defined as ≤ 0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL ratio by international \n\nscale (corresponding to ≥ 3 log reduction from standardised baseline) with a minimum of 3,000 ABL \n\ntranscripts as assessed by the central laboratory. The secondary efficacy endpoints included MMR by \n\n18 months, duration of MMR, CCyR by 12 months, duration of CCyR, event-free survival (EFS), and \n\noverall survival (OS). Complete cytogenetic response by Month 12, a secondary endpoint, was defined \n\nas the absence of Ph+ metaphases in chromosome banding analysis of ≥ 20 metaphases derived from \n\nbone marrow aspirate or MMR if an adequate cytogenetic assessment was unavailable. The p-values \n\nfor endpoints other than MMR at 12 months and CCyR by 12 months have not been adjusted for \n\nmultiple comparisons.  \n\n \n\nBaseline characteristics for the mITT population were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups \n\nwith respect to age (median age was 52 years for the bosutinib group and 53 years for the imatinib \n\ngroup with 19.5% and 17.4% of patients 65 years of age or older, respectively); gender (women 42.3% \n\nand 44.0%, respectively); and race (Caucasian 77.6% and 77.2%, Asian 12.2% and 12.4%, Black or \n\nAfrican American 4.1% and 4.1%, and Other 5.7% and 5.8%, respectively, and 1 unknown in each \n\ngroup).  \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nAfter a minimum of 12 months of follow-up in the mITT population, 77.6% of patients treated with \n\nbosutinib (N=241) and 72.4% of patients treated with imatinib (N=239) were still receiving first-line \n\ntreatment.  \n\n \n\nAfter a minimum of 12 months of follow-up in the mITT population, discontinuations due to disease \n\nprogression to AP or BP CML for bosutinib-treated patients were 0.4% compared to 1.7% for \n\nimatinib-treated patients. Five bosutinib patients and 7 imatinib patients transformed to AP CML or \n\nBP CML.

Absorption was relatively slow, with a median time-to-peak \n\nconcentration (tmax) reached after 6 hours. Bosutinib exhibits dose proportional increases in AUC and \n\nCmax, over the dose range of 200 to 600 mg. Food increased bosutinib Cmax 1.8-fold and bosutinib \n\nAUC 1.7-fold compared to the fasting state. In CML patients at steady state, Cmax (geometric mean, \n\ncoefficient of variation [CV]%) was 145 (14) ng/mL, and AUCss (geometric mean, CV%) was \n\n2,700 (16) ng•h/mL after daily administration of bosutinib at 400 mg with food. After 500 mg \n\nbosutinib daily with food, Cmax was 200 (6) ng/mL and AUCss was 3,640 (12) ng•h/mL. The solubility \n\nof bosutinib is pH-dependent and absorption is reduced when gastric pH is increased (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nDistribution  \n\nFollowing administration of a single intravenous dose of 120 mg bosutinib to healthy subjects, \n\nbosutinib had a mean (% coefficient of variation [CV]) volume of distribution of 2,331 (32) L, \n\nsuggesting that bosutinib is extensively distributed to extra vascular tissue. \n\n \n\nBosutinib was highly bound to human plasma proteins in vitro (94%) and ex vivo in healthy subjects \n\n(96%), and binding was not concentration-dependent. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies indicated that bosutinib (parent compound) undergoes predominantly \n\nhepatic metabolism in humans. Following administration of single or multiple doses of bosutinib \n\n(400 or 500 mg) to humans, the major circulating metabolites appeared to be oxydechlorinated (M2) \n\nand N-desmethylated (M5) bosutinib, with bosutinib N-oxide (M6) as a minor circulating metabolite. \n\nThe systemic exposure of N-desmethylated metabolite was 25% of the parent compound, while the \n\noxydechlorinated metabolite was 19% of the parent compound. All 3 metabolites exhibited activity \n\nthat was  5% that of bosutinib in a Src-transformed fibroblast anchorage-independent proliferation \n\nassay. In faeces, bosutinib and N-desmethyl bosutinib were the major drug-related components. \n\nIn vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicated that the major cytochrome P450 isozyme \n\ninvolved in the metabolism of bosutinib is CYP3A4 and drug interaction studies have shown that \n\nketoconazole and rifampicin had marked effect on the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib (see section 4.5). \n\nNo metabolism of bosutinib was observed with CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or \n\n3A5.  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nIn healthy subjects given a single intravenous dose of 120 mg bosutinib, the mean (%CV) terminal \n\nelimination half-life was 35.5 (24) hours, and the mean (%CV) clearance was 61.9 (26) L/h. In a \n\nmass-balance study with oral bosutinib, an average of 94.6% of the total dose was recovered in 9 days; \n\nfaeces (91.3%) was the major route of excretion, with 3.29% of the dose recovered in urine. \n\nSeventy-five percent of the dose was recovered within 96 hours. Excretion of unchanged bosutinib in \n\nurine was low with approximately 1% of the dose in both healthy subjects and those with advanced \n\nmalignant solid tumours. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nA 200 mg dose of bosutinib administered with food was evaluated in a cohort of 18 hepatically \n\nimpaired subjects (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C) and 9 matched healthy subjects. Cmax of bosutinib \n\nin plasma increased 2.4-fold, 2-fold, and 1.5-fold, respectively, in Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C; and \n\nbosutinib AUC in plasma increased 2.3-fold, 2-fold, and 1.9-fold, respectively. The t½ of bosutinib \n\nincreased in hepatic impaired patients as compared to the healthy subjects.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn a renal impairment study, a single dose of 200 mg bosutinib was administered with food to \n\n26 subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment and to 8 matching healthy volunteers. \n\nRenal impairment was based on CLCr (calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) of < 30 mL/min \n\n(severe renal impairment), 30  CLCr  50 mL/min (moderate renal impairment), or \n\n50 < CLCr  80 mL/min (mild renal impairment). Subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment \n\nhad an increase in AUC over healthy volunteers of 35% and 60%, respectively. Maximal exposure \n\nCmax increased by 28% and 34% in the moderate and severe groups, respectively. Bosutinib exposure \n\nwas not increased in subjects with mild renal impairment. The elimination half-life of bosutinib in \n\nsubjects with renal impairment was similar to that in healthy subjects.  \n\n \n\nDose adjustments for renal impairment were based on the results of this study, and the known linear \n\npharmacokinetics of bosutinib in the dose range of 200 to 600 mg. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAge, gender and race \n\nNo formal studies have been performed to assess the effects of these demographic factors. Population \n\npharmacokinetic analyses in patients with Ph+ leukaemia or malignant solid tumour and in healthy \n\nsubjects indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender or body weight. Population \n\npharmacokinetic analyses revealed that Asians had a 18% lower clearance corresponding to an \n\napproximately 25% increase in bosutinib exposure (AUC). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nBosulif has not yet been studied in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nBosutinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, \n\nreproductive toxicity, and phototoxicity studies. \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology \n\nBosutinib did not have effects on respiratory functions. In a study of the central nervous system \n\n(CNS), bosutinib treated rats displayed decreased pupil size and impaired gait. A no observed effect \n\nlevel (NOEL) for pupil size was not established, but the NOEL for impaired gait occurred at exposures \n\napproximately 11-times the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg and 8-times \n\nthe human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 500 mg (based on unbound Cmax in the \n\nrespective species). Bosutinib activity in vitro in hERG assays suggested a potential for prolongation \n\nof cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QTc). In an oral study of bosutinib in dogs, bosutinib did not \n\nproduce changes in blood pressure, abnormal atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or prolongation of the \n\nPR, QRS, or QTc of the ECG at exposures up to 3-times the human exposure resulting from the \n\nclinical dose of 400 mg and 2-times the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 500 mg \n\n(based on unbound Cmax in the respective species). A delayed increase in heart rate was observed. In an \n\nintravenous study in dogs, transient increases in heart rate and decreases in blood pressure and \n\nminimal prolongation of the QTc (< 10 msec) were observed at exposures ranging from approximately \n\n6-times to 20-times the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg and 4-times to \n\n15-times the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 500 mg (based on unbound Cmax in the \n\nrespective species). The relationship between the observed effects and medicinal product treatment \n\nwere inconclusive. \n\n \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats of up to 6 months in duration and in dogs up to 9 months in \n\nduration revealed the gastrointestinal system to be the primary target organ of toxicity of bosutinib. \n\nClinical signs of toxicity included foecal changes and were associated with decreased food \n\nconsumption and body weight loss which occasionally led to death or elective euthanasia.  \n\n \n\nHistopathologically, luminal dilation, goblet cell hyperplasia, haemorrhage, erosion, and oedema of \n\nthe intestinal tract, and sinus erythrocytosis and haemorrhage in the mesenteric lymph nodes, were \n\nobserved. The liver was also identified as a target organ in rats. Toxicities were characterised by an \n\nincrease in liver weights in correlation with hepatocellular hypertrophy which occurred in the absence \n\nof elevated liver enzymes or microscopic signs of hepatocellular cytotoxicity, and is of unknown \n\nrelevance to humans. The exposure comparison across species indicates that exposures that did not \n\nelicit adverse events in the 6- and 9-month toxicity studies in rats and dogs, respectively, were similar \n\nto the human exposure resulting from a clinical dose of 400 mg or 500 mg (based on unbound AUC in \n\nthe respective species). \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity \n\nGenotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with \n\nand without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a mutagenic potential of bosutinib. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nReproductive toxicity and development toxicity \n\nIn a rat fertility study, fertility was slightly decreased in males. Females were observed with increased \n\nembryonic resorptions, and decreases in implantations and viable embryos. The dose at which no \n\nadverse reproductive effects were observed in males (30 mg/kg/day) and females (3 mg/kg/day) \n\nresulted in exposures equal to 0.6-times and 0.3-times, respectively, the human exposure resulting \n\nfrom the clinical dose of 400 mg, and 0.5-times and 0.2-times, respectively, the human exposure \n\nresulting from the clinical dose of 500 mg (based on unbound AUC in the respective species). An \n\neffect on male fertility cannot be excluded (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nFoetal exposure to bosutinib-derived radioactivity during pregnancy was demonstrated in a placental \n\ntransfer study in gravid Sprague-Dawley rats. In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, there \n\nwere reduced number of pups born at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, and increased incidence of total litter loss and \n\ndecreased growth of offspring after birth occurred at 70 mg/kg/day. The dose at which no adverse \n\ndevelopment effects were observed (10 mg/kg/day) resulted in exposures equal to 1.3-times and \n\n1.0-times human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg and 500 mg, respectively (based \n\non unbound AUC in the respective species). In a rabbit developmental toxicity study at the maternally \n\ntoxic dose, there were foetal anomalies observed (fused sternebrae, and 2 foetuses had various visceral \n\nobservations), and a slight decrease in foetal body weight. The exposure at the highest dose tested in \n\nrabbits (10 mg/kg/day) that did not result in adverse foetal effects was 0.9-times and 0.7-times the \n\nhuman exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg or 500 mg, respectively (based on unbound \n\nAUC in the respective species). \n\n \n\nFollowing a single oral (10 mg/kg) administration of [14C] radiolabelled bosutinib to lactating \n\nSprague-Dawley rats, radioactivity was readily excreted into breast milk as early as 0.5 hr after dosing. \n\nConcentration of radioactivity in milk was up to 8-fold higher than in plasma. This allowed \n\nmeasurable concentrations of radioactivity to appear in the plasma of nursing pups. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity \n\nBosutinib was not carcinogenic in the 2-year rat and 6-month rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity studies. \n\n \n\nPhototoxicity \n\nBosutinib has demonstrated the ability to absorb light in the UV-B and UV-A range and is distributed \n\ninto the skin and uveal tract of pigmented rats. However, bosutinib did not demonstrate a potential for \n\nphototoxicity of the skin or eyes in pigmented rats exposed to bosutinib in the presence of \n\nUV radiation at bosutinib exposures up to 3-times and 2-times the human exposure resulting from the \n\nclinical dose of 400 or 500 mg, respectively (based on unbound Cmax in the respective species). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Bosulif is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nBosulif contains the active substance bosutinib. It is used to treat adult patients who have a type of \n\nleukaemia called Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia \n\n(CML) and are newly-diagnosed or for whom previous medicines to treat CML have either not worked \n\nor are not suitable. Ph-positive CML is a cancer of the blood which makes the body produce too many \n\nof a specific type of white blood cell called granulocytes.  \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Bosulif works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \n\nask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What do you need to know before you take Bosulif \n\n \n\nDo not take Bosulif \n\n- if you are allergic to bosutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n\n- if your doctor has told you that your liver has been damaged and is not working normally. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Bosulif: \n\n- if you have, or have had in the past, liver problems. Tell your doctor if you have a history of \n\nliver problems including hepatitis (liver infection or inflammation) of any kind, or a history of \n\nany of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: itching, yellow eyes or skin, dark \n\nurine, and pain or discomfort in the right upper stomach area. Your doctor should do blood tests \n\n\n\n41 \n\nto check your liver function prior to your starting treatment with Bosulif and for the first \n\n3 months of treatment with Bosulif, and as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\n- if you have diarrhoea and vomiting. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs \n\nand symptoms: an increase in the number of stools (bowel movements) per day over normal, an \n\nincrease in episodes of vomiting, blood in your vomit, stools (bowel movements) or urine, or \n\nhave black stools (tarry black bowel movements). You should ask your doctor if use of your \n\ntreatment for vomiting may result in a greater risk of heart arrhythmias. In particular, you should \n\nask your doctor if you want to use a medicine containing domperidone for the treatment of \n\nnausea and/or vomiting. Treatment of nausea or vomiting with such medicines together with \n\nBosulif may result in a greater risk of dangerous heart arrhythmias. \n\n \n\n- if you suffer from bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following \n\nsigns and symptoms such as abnormal bleeding or bruising without having an injury. \n\n \n\n- if you have an infection. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs and \n\nsymptoms such as fever, problems with urine such as burning on urination, a new cough, or a \n\nnew sore throat. \n\n \n\n- if you have fluid retention. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs and \n\nsymptoms of fluid retention during Bosulif treatment such as swelling of the ankles, feet or legs; \n\ndifficulty breathing chest pain or a cough (these may be signs of fluid retention in the lungs or \n\nchest). \n\n \n\n- if you have heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a heart disorder, such as arrhythmias \n\nor an abnormal electrical signal called “prolongation of the QT interval”. This is always \n\nimportant, but especially if you are experiencing frequent or prolonged diarrhoea as described \n\nabove. If you faint (loss of consciousness) or have an irregular heartbeat while taking Bosulif, \n\ntell your doctor immediately, as this may be a sign of a serious heart condition. \n\n \n\n- if you have been told that you have problems with your kidneys. Tell your doctor if you are \n\nurinating more frequently and producing larger amounts of urine with a pale colour or if you are \n\nurinating less frequently and producing smaller amounts of urine with a dark colour. Also tell \n\nyour doctor if you are losing weight or have experienced swelling of your feet, ankles, legs, \n\nhands or face.  \n\n \n\n-  if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Bosulif \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will \n\nbe carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n \n\n- if you have or have had pancreas problems. Tell your doctor if you develop abdominal pain \n\nor discomfort. \n\n \n\n- if you have any of these symptoms: serious skin rashes. Tell your doctor if you develop any \n\nof the following signs and symptoms of painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters \n\nand/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g., mouth and lips).  \n\n \n\n- if you notice any of these symptoms: pain in your side, blood in your urine or reduced \n\namount of urine. When your disease is very severe, your body may not be able to clear all the \n\nwaste products from the dying cancer cells. This is called tumour lysis syndrome and can cause \n\nkidney failure and heart problems within 48 hours of the first dose of Bosulif. Your doctor will \n\nbe aware of this and may ensure you are adequately hydrated and give you other medicines to \n\nhelp prevent it. \n\n \n\nSun/UV protection \n\nYou may become more sensitive to the sun or UV rays while taking bosutinib. It is important to cover \n\nsunlight-exposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nBosulif is not recommended for people whose age is under 18 years. This medicine has not been \n\nstudied in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Bosulif \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, vitamins, and herbal medicines. Some \n\nmedicines can affect the levels of Bosulif in your body. You should inform your doctor if you are \n\ntaking medicines containing active substances such as those listed below: \n\n \n\nThe following active substances may increase the risk of side effects with Bosulif: \n\n- ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and fluconazole, used to treat fungal \n\ninfections. \n\n- clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin, used to treat bacterial infections. \n\n- nefazodone, used to treat depression. \n\n- mibefradil, diltiazem and verapamil, used to lower blood pressure in people with high blood \n\npressure. \n\n- ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir, \n\nfosamprenavir and darunavir, used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS. \n\n- boceprevir and telaprevir, used to treat hepatitis C. \n\n- aprepitant, used to prevent and control nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. \n\n- imatinib, used to treat a type of leukaemia.  \n\n- crizotinib, used to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer. \n\n \n\nThe following active substances may reduce the effectiveness of Bosulif: \n\n- rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis. \n\n- phenytoin and carbamazepine, used to treat epilepsy. \n\n- bosentan, used to lower high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary artery hypertension). \n\n- nafcillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. \n\n- St. John’s Wort (a herbal preparation obtained without a prescription), used to treat depression. \n\n- efavirenz and etravirine, used to treat HIV infections/AIDS. \n\n- modafinil, used to treat certain types of sleep disorders. \n\n \n\nThese medicines should be avoided during your treatment with Bosulif. If you are taking any of them, \n\ntell your doctor. Your doctor may change the dose of these medicines, change the dose of Bosulif, or \n\nswitch you to a different medicine. \n\n \n\nThe following active substances may affect the heart rhythm: \n\n- amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol used to treat heart disorder.  \n\n- chloroquine, halofantrine used to treat malaria.  \n\n- clarithromycin and moxifloxacin antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.  \n\n- haloperidol, used to treat psychotic disease such as schizophrenia.  \n\n- domperidone, used to treat nausea and vomiting or to stimulate breast milk production.  \n\n- methadone, used to treat pain.  \n\n \n\nThese medicines should be taken with caution during your treatment with Bosulif. If you are taking \n\nany of them, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nThe medicines listed here may not be the only ones that could interact with Bosulif. \n\n \n\nBosulif with food and drink \n\nDo not take Bosulif with grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as it may increase the risk of side effects. \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nBosulif is not to be used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary, because Bosulif could harm an \n\nunborn baby. Ask your doctor for advice before taking Bosulif if you are pregnant or might become \n\npregnant.  \n\n \n\nWomen taking Bosulif will be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least \n\n1 month after the last dose. Vomiting or diarrhoea may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. \n\n \n\nThere is a risk that treatment with Bosulif will lead to decreased fertility and you may wish to seek \n\nadvice about sperm storage before the treatment starts. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. Do not breast-feed during treatment with Bosulif as it could \n\nharm your baby. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIf you experience dizziness, have blurred vision or feel unusually tired, do not drive or operate \n\nmachines until these side effects have gone away. \n\n \n\nBosulif contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg, 400 mg, or 500 mg tablet, that \n\nis to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

The \n\nrecommended dose is 500 mg once daily for patients whose previous medicines to treat CML have \n\neither not worked or are not suitable. In the event that you have moderate or severe kidney problems, \n\nyour doctor will reduce your dose by 100 mg once daily for moderate kidney problems and by an \n\nadditional 100 mg once daily for severe kidney problems. Your doctor may adjust the dose using the \n\n100 mg tablets depending upon your medical conditions, upon your response to treatment and/or on \n\nany side effect you may experience. Take the tablet(s) in the morning with food. Swallow the tablet(s) \n\nwhole with water. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Bosulif than you should \n\nIf you accidentally take too many Bosulif tablets or a higher dose than you need, contact a doctor for \n\nadvice right away. If possible, show the doctor the pack, or this leaflet.

The PRAC \n\nRapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing bosutinib should be \n\namended accordingly. \n\n \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\n \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for bosutinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the \n\nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bosutinib is unchanged subject to the \n\nproposed changes to the product information.  \n\n \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
