CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nVFEND, is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal agent and is indicated in adults and children aged 2 years\nand above as follows:\n\nTreatment of invasive aspergillosis.\n\nTreatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients. \n\nTreatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei). \n\nTreatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.\n\nVFEND should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-threatening infections.\n\nProphylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) \nrecipients.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nPosology\nElectrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored \nand corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n3\n\nVFEND is also available as 200 mg powder for solution for infusion, 200 mg powder and solvent for \nsolution for infusion and 40 mg/ml powder for oral suspension.\n\nTreatment\nAdults \nTherapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either intravenous or oral VFEND to \nachieve plasma concentrations on Day 1 that are close to steady state. On the basis of the high oral \nbioavailability (96%; see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and oral administration is appropriate \nwhen clinically indicated.\n\nDetailed information on dosage recommendations is provided in the following table:\n\nIntravenous Oral \nPatients 40 kg and \n\nabove*\nPatients less than \n\n40 kg*\n\nLoading dose \nregimen \n(first 24 hours) \n\n6 mg/kg every 12 \nhours\n\n400 mg every 12 \nhours\n\n200 mg every 12 \nhours\n\nMaintenance dose \n(after first 24 \nhours) \n\n4 mg/kg twice daily 200 mg twice daily 100 mg twice daily\n\n* This also applies to patients aged 15 years and older\n\nDuration of treatment \nTreatment duration should be as short as possible depending on the patient’s clinical and mycological \nresponse. Long term exposure to voriconazole greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful \nassessment of the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nDosage adjustment (Adults)\nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the maintenance dose may be increased to 300 mg twice daily \nfor oral administration. For patients less than 40 kg the oral dose may be increased to 150 mg twice daily.\n\nIf patient is unable to tolerate treatment at a higher dose, reduce the oral dose by 50 mg steps to the 200 mg \ntwice daily (or 100 mg twice daily for patients less than 40 kg) maintenance dose.\n\nIn case of use as prophylaxis, refer below.\n\nChildren (2 to <12 years) and young adolescents with low body weight (12 to 14 years and <50 kg)\nVoriconazole should be dosed as children as these young adolescents may metabolize voriconazole more \nsimilarly to children than to adults. \n\nThe recommended dosing regimen is as follows:\n\nIntravenous Oral\nLoading Dose Regimen \n(first 24 hours)\n\n9 mg/kg every 12 hours Not recommended\n\nMaintenance Dose\n(after first 24 hours)\n\n8 mg/kg twice daily \n9 mg/kg twice daily \n(a maximum dose of 350 mg \ntwice daily)\n\nNote: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged \n2 to <12 years and 26 immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to <17 years. \n\nIt is recommended to initiate the therapy with intravenous regimen, and oral regimen should be considered \nonly after there is a significant clinical improvement. It should be noted that an 8 mg/kg intravenous dose \nwill provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose.\n\n\n\n4\n\nThese oral dose recommendations for children are based on studies in which voriconazole was \nadministered as the powder for oral suspension. Bioequivalence between the powder for oral suspension \nand tablets has not been investigated in a paediatric population. Considering the assumed limited gastro-\nenteric transit time in paediatric patients, the absorption of tablets may be different in paediatric compared \nto adult patients. It is therefore recommended to use the oral suspension formulation in children aged \n2 to <12. \n\nAll other adolescents (12 to 14 years and ≥50 kg; 15 to 17 years regardless of body weight)\nVoriconazole should be dosed as adults.\n\nDosage adjustment (Children [2 to <12 years] and young adolescents with low body weight [12 to 14 years \nand <50 kg])\nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps \nif the maximum oral dose of 350 mg was used initially). If patient is unable to tolerate treatment, reduce the \ndose by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps if the maximum oral dose of 350 mg was used initially).\n\nUse in paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\nProphylaxis in Adults and Children\nProphylaxis should be initiated on the day of transplant and may be administered for up to 100 days. \nProphylaxis should be as short as possible depending on the risk for developing invasive fungal infection \n(IFI) as defined by neutropenia or immunosuppression. It may only be continued up to 180 days after \ntransplantation in case of continuing immunosuppression or graft versus host disease (GvHD) (see section \n5.1). \n\nDosage \nThe recommended dosing regimen for prophylaxis is the same as for treatment in the respective age groups. \nPlease refer to the treatment tables above.\n\nDuration of prophylaxis\nThe safety and efficacy of voriconazole use for longer than 180 days has not been adequately studied in \nclinical trials.\n\nUse of voriconazole in prophylaxis for greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment of \nthe benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nThe following instructions apply to both Treatment and Prophylaxis\n\nDosage adjustment\nFor prophylaxis use, dose adjustments are not recommended in the case of lack of efficacy or treatment-\nrelated adverse events. In the case of treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation of voriconazole and \nuse of alternative antifungal agents must be considered (see section 4.4 and 4.8)\n\nDosage adjustments in case of co-administration\nPhenytoin may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased \nfrom 200 mg to 400 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), \nsee sections 4.4 and 4.5.\n\nThe combination of voriconazole with rifabutin should, if possible be avoided. However, if the combination \nis strictly needed, the maintenance dose of voriconazole may be increased from 200 mg to 350 mg orally, \ntwice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), see sections 4.4 and 4.5.\n\nEfavirenz may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased to \n400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose is reduced by 50%, i.e. to 300 mg once daily. When treatment \nwith voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\n\n\n5\n\nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of orally administered voriconazole are not affected by renal impairment. Therefore, \nno adjustment is necessary for oral dosing for patients with mild to severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. A 4-hour haemodialysis session does not \nremove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment. \n\nHepatic impairment\nIt is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved \nin patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) receiving voriconazole (see section \n5.2). \n\nVoriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe chronic hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C). \n\nThere is limited data on the safety of VFEND in patients with abnormal liver function tests (aspartate \ntransaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], or total bilirubin >5 times the \nupper limit of normal).\n\nVoriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, \nsuch as jaundice, and must only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs \nthe potential risk. Patients with severe hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity (see \nsection 4.8). \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of VFEND in children below 2 years has not been established. Currently available \ndata are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n\nMethod of administration\nVFEND film-coated tablets are to be taken at least one hour before, or one hour following, a meal.\n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCoadministration with CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine since \nincreased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare \noccurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration with rifampicin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital since these medicinal products are \nlikely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg once daily or \nhigher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole \nconcentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz \nplasma concentrations (see section 4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4).\n\nCoadministration with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg and above twice daily) because ritonavir \nsignificantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at this dose (see section \n4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4). \n\nCoadministration with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine), which are CYP3A4 substrates, \nsince increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to ergotism (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration with sirolimus since voriconazole is likely to increase plasma concentrations of \nsirolimus significantly (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n6\n\nCoadministration with St. John’s Wort (see section 4.5). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nHypersensitivity\nCaution should be used in prescribing VFEND to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles (see also \nsection 4.8). \n\nCardiovascular \nVoriconazole has been associated with QTc interval prolongation. There have been rare cases of torsades de \npointes in patients taking voriconazole who had risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, \ncardiomyopathy, hypokalaemia and concomitant medicinal products that may have been contributory. \nVoriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, \nsuch as:\n\n Congenital or acquired QTc-prolongation.\n Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present.\n Sinus bradycardia.\n Existing symptomatic arrhythmias.\n Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QTc interval. Electrolyte disturbances such \n\nas hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored and corrected, if \nnecessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.2). A study has been \nconducted in healthy volunteers which examined the effect on QTc interval of single doses of \nvoriconazole up to 4 times the usual daily dose. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the \npotentially clinically-relevant threshold of 500 msec (see section 5.1). \n\nHepatic toxicity\nIn clinical trials, there have been cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole \n(including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of \nhepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions \n(predominantly haematological malignancy).Transient hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, \nhave occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been \nreversible on discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.8). \n\nMonitoring of hepatic function\nPatients receiving VFEND must be carefully monitored for hepatic toxicity. Clinical management should \ninclude laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (specifically AST and ALT) at the initiation of treatment \nwith VFEND and at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Treatment duration should be as short as \npossible; however, if based on the benefit-risk assessment the treatment is continued (see section 4.2), \nmonitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly if there are no changes in the liver function tests. \n\nIf the liver function tests become markedly elevated, VFEND should be discontinued, unless the medical \njudgment of the risk-benefit of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use. \n\nMonitoring of hepatic function should be carried out in both children and adults.\n\nSerious dermatological adverse reactions\n\n Phototoxicity\nIn addition VFEND has been associated with phototoxicity including reactions such as ephelides, \nlentigo, actinic keratosis and pseudoporphyria. It is recommended that all patients, including \nchildren, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment and use measures such as \nprotective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF).\n\n\n\n7\n\n Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC)\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin has been reported in patients, some of whom have reported \nprior phototoxic reactions. If phototoxic reactions occur multidisciplinary advice should be sought,\nVFEND discontinuation and use of alternative antifungal agents should be considered and the \npatient should be referred to a dermatologist. If VFEND is continued, however, dermatologic \nevaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis, to allow early detection and \nmanagement of premalignant lesions. VFEND should be discontinued if premalignant skin lesions or \nsquamous cell carcinoma are identified (see below the section under Long-term treatment).\n\n Exfoliative cutaneous reactions\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), \nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported with the use of voriconazole. If a patient \ndevelops a rash he should be monitored closely and VFEND discontinued if lesions progress.\n\nLong-term treatment\nLong term exposure (treatment or prophylaxis) greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful \nassessment of the benefit-risk balance and physicians should therefore consider the need to limit the \nexposure to VFEND (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) has been reported in relation with long-term VFEND \ntreatment.\n\nNon-infectious periostitis with elevated fluoride and alkaline phosphatase levels has been reported in \ntransplant patients. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with \nperiostitis VFEND discontinuation should be considered after multidisciplinary advice.\n\nVisual adverse reactions\nThere have been reports of prolonged visual adverse reactions, including blurred vision, optic neuritis and \npapilloedema (see section 4.8).\n\nRenal adverse reactions\nAcute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. \nPatients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function (see \nsection 4.8). \n\nMonitoring of renal function\nPatients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include \nlaboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. \n\nMonitoring of pancreatic function\nPatients, especially children, with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]), should be monitored closely during VFEND treatment. \nMonitoring of serum amylase or lipase may be considered in this clinical situation.\n\nPaediatric population\nSafety and effectiveness in paediatric subjects below the age of two years has not been established (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). Voriconazole is indicated for paediatric patients aged two years or older. A higher \nfrequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the paediatric population (see section 4.8). Hepatic \nfunction should be monitored in both children and adults. Oral bioavailability may be limited in paediatric \npatients aged 2 to <12 years with malabsorption and very low body weight for age. In that case, intravenous \nvoriconazole administration is recommended. \n\n Serious dermatological adverse reactions (including SCC)\nThe frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the paediatric population. As an evolution \ntowards SCC has been reported, stringent measures for the photoprotection are warranted in this \n\n\n\n8\n\npopulation of patients. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, \nsun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation.\n\nProphylaxis\nIn case of treatment-related adverse events (hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions including phototoxicity and \nSCC, severe or prolonged visual disorders and periostitis), discontinuation of voriconazole and use of \nalternative antifungal agents must be considered.\n\nPhenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate and potent CYP450 inducer)\nCareful monitoring of phenytoin levels is recommended when phenytoin is coadministered with \nvoriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and phenytoin should be avoided unless the benefit \noutweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n\nEfavirenz (CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate)\nWhen voriconazole is coadministered with efavirenz the dose of voriconazole should be increased to \n400 mg every 12 hours and the dose of efavirenz should be decreased to 300 mg every 24 hours (see \nsections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). \n\nRifabutin (Potent CYP450 inducer)\nCareful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions to rifabutin (e.g., uveitis) is recommended \nwhen rifabutin is coadministered with voriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and rifabutin should \nbe avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n\nRitonavir (potent CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) \nCoadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided unless an \nassessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\nEverolimus (CYP3A4 substrate, P-gp substrate)\nCoadministration of voriconazole with everolimus is not recommended because voriconazole is expected \nto significantly increase everolimus concentrations. Currently there are insufficient data to allow dosing \nrecommendations in this situation (see section 4.5).\n\nMethadone (CYP3A4 substrate)\nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to methadone, including QTc \nprolongation, is recommended when coadministered with voriconazole since methadone levels increased \nfollowing coadministration of voriconazole. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed (see section \n4.5). \n\nShort-acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate)\nReduction in the dose of alfentanil, fentanyl and other short-acting opiates similar in structure to alfentanil \nand metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole \n(see section 4.5). As the half-life of alfentanil is prolonged in a 4-fold manner when alfentanil is \ncoadministered with voriconazole, and in an independent published study concomitant use of voriconazole \nwith fentanyl resulted in an increase in the mean AUC0-∞ of fentanyl, frequent monitoring for opiate-\nassociated adverse reactions (including a longer respiratory monitoring period) may be necessary.\n\nLong-acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate)\nReduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., \nhydrocodone) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Frequent monitoring for opiate-\nassociated adverse reactions may be necessary (see section 4.5).\n\nFluconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor)\nCoadministration of oral voriconazole and oral fluconazole resulted in a significant increase in Cmax and \nAUCτ of voriconazole in healthy subjects. The reduced dose and/or frequency of voriconazole and \nfluconazole that would eliminate this effect have not been established. Monitoring for voriconazole-\nassociated adverse reactions is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole (see \nsection 4.5). \n\n\n\n9\n\nVFEND tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nVoriconazole is metabolised by, and inhibits the activity of, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, \nCYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these isoenzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole \nplasma concentrations, respectively, and there is potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma \nconcentrations of substances metabolised by these CYP450 isoenzymes.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, drug interaction studies have been performed in healthy adult male subjects \nusing multiple dosing to steady state with oral voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily (BID). These results are \nrelevant to other populations and routes of administration. \n\nVoriconazole should be administered with caution in patients with concomitant medication that is known \nto prolong QTc interval. When there is also a potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma \nconcentrations of substances metabolised by CYP3A4 isoenzymes (certain antihistamines, quinidine, \ncisapride, pimozide), coadministration is contraindicated (see below and section 4.3).\n\nInteraction table\nInteractions between voriconazole and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (once daily \nas “QD”, twice daily as “BID”, three times daily as “TID” and not determined as “ND”). The direction of \nthe arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric \nmean ratio being within (↔), below (↓) or above (↑) the 80-125% range. The asterisk (*) indicates a two-\nway interaction. AUC, AUCt and AUC0- represent area under the curve over a dosing interval, from time \nzero to the time with detectable measurement and from time zero to infinity, respectively.\n\nThe interactions in the table are presented in the following order: contraindications, those requiring dose \nadjustment and careful clinical and/or biological monitoring, and finally those that have no significant \npharmacokinetic interaction but may be of clinical interest in this therapeutic field.\n\nMedicinal product\n[Mechanism of interaction]\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean changes (%)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning\ncoadministration\n\nAstemizole, cisapride, \npimozide, quinidine and \nterfenadine\n[CYP3A4 substrates]\n\nAlthough not studied, increased \nplasma concentrations of these \nmedicinal products can lead to QTc \nprolongation and rare occurrences \nof torsades de pointes.\n\nContraindicated (see section \n4.3)\n\nCarbamazepine and long-acting \nbarbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital, \nmephobarbital) \n[potent CYP450 inducers]\n\nAlthough not studied, \ncarbamazepine and long-acting \nbarbiturates are likely to \nsignificantly decrease plasma \nvoriconazole concentrations.\n\nContraindicated (see section \n4.3)\n\n\n\n10\n\nMedicinal product\n[Mechanism of interaction]\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean changes (%)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning\ncoadministration\n\nEfavirenz (a non-nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor) \n[CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 \ninhibitor and substrate]\n\nEfavirenz 400 mg QD, \ncoadministered with \nvoriconazole 200 mg BID*\n\nEfavirenz 300 mg QD, \ncoadministered with \nvoriconazole 400 mg BID*\n\nEfavirenz Cmax  38%\nEfavirenz AUC  44%\nVoriconazole Cmax  61%\nVoriconazole AUC  77%\n\nCompared to efavirenz 600 mg QD,\nEfavirenz Cmax ↔\nEfavirenz AUC  17%\n\nCompared to voriconazole 200 mg \nBID,\nVoriconazole Cmax  23%\nVoriconazole AUC  7%\n\nUse of standard doses of \nvoriconazole with efavirenz \ndoses of 400 mg QD or higher\nis contraindicated (see\nsection 4.3). \n\nVoriconazole may be \ncoadministered with efavirenz \nif the voriconazole \nmaintenance dose is increased \nto 400 mg BID and the \nefavirenz dose is decreased to \n300 mg QD.

Breast-feeding must be stopped on \ninitiation of treatment with VFEND. \n\nFertility\nIn an animal study, no impairment of fertility was demonstrated in male and female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nVFEND has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It may cause transient and \nreversible changes to vision, including blurring, altered/enhanced visual perception and/or photophobia. \nPatients must avoid potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving or operating machinery while \nexperiencing these symptoms. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of safety profile\nThe safety profile of voriconazole in adults is based on an integrated safety database of more than 2,000 \nsubjects (including 1,603 adult patients in therapeutic trials) and an additional 270 adults in prophylaxis \ntrials. This represents a heterogeneous population, containing patients with haematological malignancy, \nHIV-infected patients with oesophageal candidiasis and refractory fungal infections, non-neutropenic \npatients with candidaemia or aspergillosis and healthy volunteers.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions were visual impairment, pyrexia, rash, vomiting, nausea, \ndiarrhoea, headache, peripheral oedema, liver function test abnormal, respiratory distress and abdominal \npain.\n\nThe severity of the adverse reactions was generally mild to moderate. No clinically significant differences \nwere seen when the safety data were analysed by age, race, or gender. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nIn the table below, since the majority of the studies were of an open nature, all causality adverse reactions\nand their frequency categories in 1,873 adults from pooled therapeutic (1,603) and prophylaxis (270) studies, \nby system organ class, are listed.\n\nFrequency categories are expressed as: Very common (1/10);

These visual impairments were transient and fully reversible, with the \nmajority spontaneously resolving within 60 minutes and no clinically significant long-term visual effects \nwere observed. There was evidence of attenuation with repeated doses of voriconazole. The visual \nimpairments were generally mild, rarely resulted in discontinuation and were not associated with long-term \nsequelae. Visual impairments may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses.\n\nThe mechanism of action is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a \nstudy in healthy volunteers investigating the impact of voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused \na decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude. The ERG measures electrical currents in the \nretina. The ERG changes did not progress over 29 days of treatment and were fully reversible on withdrawal \nof voriconazole.\n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events (see section 4.4).\n\nDermatological reactions \nDermatological reactions were very common in patients treated with voriconazole in clinical trials, but these \npatients had serious underlying diseases and were receiving multiple concomitant medicinal products. The \nmajority of rashes were of mild to moderate severity. Patients have developed severe cutaneous adverse \nreactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (uncommon), toxic epidermal necrolysis\n(TEN) (rare), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (rare) and erythema \n\n\n\n20\n\nmultiforme (rare) during treatment with VFEND (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a patient develops a rash they should be monitored closely and VFEND discontinued if lesions progress. \nPhotosensitivity reactions such as ephelides, lentigo and actinic keratosis have been reported, especially \nduring long-term therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nThere have been reports of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in patients treated with VFEND for long \nperiods of time; the mechanism has not been established (see section 4.4).\n\nLiver function tests \nThe overall incidence of transaminase increases >3 xULN (not necessarily comprising an adverse event) in \nthe voriconazole clinical programme was 18.0% (319/1,768) in adults and 25.8% (73/283) in paediatric \nsubjects who received voriconazole for pooled therapeutic and prophylaxis use. Liver function test \nabnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal \nliver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, \nincluding discontinuation of therapy. \n\nVoriconazole has been associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity in patients with other serious \nunderlying conditions. This includes cases of jaundice, hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nProphylaxis\nIn an open-label, comparative, multicenter study comparing voriconazole and itraconazole as primary \nprophylaxis in adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI, \npermanent discontinuation of voriconazole due to AEs was reported in 39.3% of subjects versus 39.6% of \nsubjects in the itraconazole arm. Treatment-emergent hepatic AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of \nstudy medication for 50 subjects (21.4%) treated with voriconazole and for 18 subjects (7.1%) treated with \nitraconazole. \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety of voriconazole was investigated in 288 paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years (169) and 12 to \n<18 years (119) who received voriconazole for prophylaxis (183) and therapeutic use (105) in clinical trials. \nThe safety of voriconazole was also investigated in 158 additional paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in \ncompassionate use programs. Overall, the safety profile of voriconazole in paediatric population was similar \nto that in adults. However, a trend towards a higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations, reported as \nadverse events in clinical trials was observed in paediatric patients as compared to adults (14.2% \ntransaminases increased in paediatrics compared to 5.3% in adults). Post-marketing data suggest there might \nbe a higher occurrence of skin reactions (especially erythema) in the paediatric population compared to \nadults. In the 22 patients less than 2 years old who received voriconazole in a compassionate use programme, \nthe following adverse reactions (for which a relationship to voriconazole could not be excluded) were \nreported: photosensitivity reaction (1), arrhythmia (1), pancreatitis (1), blood bilirubin increased (1), hepatic \nenzymes increased (1), rash (1) and papilloedema (1). There have been post-marketing reports of pancreatitis \nin paediatric patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nIn clinical trials there were 3 cases of accidental overdose. All occurred in paediatric patients, who received \nup to five times the recommended intravenous dose of voriconazole. A single adverse reaction of \nphotophobia of 10 minutes duration was reported. \n\nThere is no known antidote to voriconazole. \n\nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. In an overdose, haemodialysis may assist \n\n\n\n21\n\nin the removal of voriconazole from the body. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02A C03\n\nMode of Action\nVoriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. The primary mode of action of voriconazole is the inhibition of \nfungal cytochrome P450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylation, an essential step in fungal ergosterol \nbiosynthesis. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol \nin the fungal cell membrane and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of voriconazole. Voriconazole \nhas been shown to be more selective for fungal cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for various mammalian \ncytochrome P-450 enzyme systems.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic Relationship\nIn 10 therapeutic studies, the median for the average and maximum plasma concentrations in individual \nsubjects across the studies was 2425 ng/ml (inter-quartile range 1193 to 4380 ng/ml) and 3742 ng/ml (inter-\nquartile range 2027 to 6302 ng/ml), respectively. A positive association between mean, maximum or \nminimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy in therapeutic studies was not found and this \nrelationship has not been explored in prophylaxis studies. \n\nPharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic analyses of clinical trial data identified positive associations \nbetween plasma voriconazole concentrations and both liver function test abnormalities and visual \ndisturbances. Dose adjustments in prophylaxis studies have not been explored.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nIn vitro, voriconazole displays broad-spectrum antifungal activity with antifungal potency against \nCandida species (including fluconazole-resistant C. krusei and resistant strains of C. glabrata and \nC. albicans) and fungicidal activity against all Aspergillus species tested. In addition voriconazole shows in \nvitro fungicidal activity against emerging fungal pathogens, including those such as Scedosporium or \nFusarium which have limited susceptibility to existing antifungal agents.\n\nClinical efficacy defined as partial or complete response, has been demonstrated for Aspergillus spp. \nincluding A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. niger, A. nidulans; Candida spp., including C. albicans, \nC. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis; and limited numbers of C. dubliniensis,\nC. inconspicua, and C. guilliermondii, Scedosporium spp., including S. apiospermum, S. prolificans;\nand Fusarium spp.\n\nOther treated fungal infections (often with either partial or complete response) included isolated cases of \nAlternaria spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Blastoschizomyces capitatus, Cladosporium spp., Coccidioides \nimmitis, Conidiobolus coronatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Exserohilum rostratum, Exophiala spinifera, \nFonsecaea pedrosoi, Madurella mycetomatis, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Penicillium spp. including \nP. marneffei, Phialophora richardsiae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Trichosporon spp. including\nT. beigelii infections.\n\nIn vitro activity against clinical isolates has been observed for Acremonium spp., Alternaria spp., \nBipolaris spp., Cladophialophora spp., and Histoplasma capsulatum, with most strains being inhibited by \nconcentrations of voriconazole in the range 0.05 to 2 µg/ml.\n\nIn vitro activity against the following pathogens has been shown, but the clinical significance is \nunknown: Curvularia spp. and Sporothrix spp. \n\nBreakpoints\nSpecimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be \nobtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the \n\n\n\n22\n\nresults of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become \navailable, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. \n\nThe species most frequently involved in causing human infections include C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, \nC. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei, all of which usually exhibit minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs)\nof less than 1 mg/L for voriconazole.  \n\nHowever, the in vitro activity of voriconazole against Candida species is not uniform. Specifically, for \nC. glabrata, the MICs of voriconazole for fluconazole-resistant isolates are proportionally higher than are \nthose of fluconazole-susceptible isolates. Therefore, every attempt should be made to identify Candida to \nspecies level. If antifungal susceptibility testing is available, the MIC results may be interpreted using \nbreakpoint criteria established by European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).\n\nEUCAST Breakpoints\n\nCandida species MIC breakpoint (mg/L)\n≤S (Susceptible) >R (Resistant)\n\nCandida albicans1 0.125 0.125\nCandida tropicalis1 0.125 0.125\nCandida parapsilosis1 0.125 0.125\nCandida glabrata2 Insufficient evidence\nCandida krusei3 Insufficient evidence\nOther Candida spp.4 Insufficient evidence\n1 Strains with MIC values above the Susceptible (S) breakpoint are rare, or \nnot yet reported. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests \non any such isolate must be repeated and if the result is confirmed the \nisolate sent to a reference laboratory. \n2 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in patients with C. glabrata\ninfections was 21% lower compared to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. \ntropicalis. In vitro data showed a slight increase of resistance of C. \nglabrata to voriconazole.\n3 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in C. krusei infections was \nsimilar to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. However, as there \nwere only 9 cases available for EUCAST analysis, there is currently \ninsufficient evidence to set clinical breakpoints for C. krusei. \n4 EUCAST has not determined non-species related breakpoints for \nvoriconazole.\n\nClinical experience \nSuccessful outcome in this section is defined as complete or partial response. \n\nAspergillus infections – efficacy in aspergillosis patients with poor prognosis \nVoriconazole has in vitro fungicidal activity against Aspergillus spp. The efficacy and survival benefit of \nvoriconazole versus conventional amphotericin B in the primary treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis \nwas demonstrated in an open, randomised, multicentre study in 277 immunocompromised patients treated \nfor 12 weeks. Voriconazole was administered intravenously with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours \nfor the first 24 hours followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours for a minimum of 7 days. \nTherapy could then be switched to the oral formulation at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours. Median duration \nof IV voriconazole therapy was 10 days (range 2-85 days). After IV voriconazole therapy, the median \nduration of oral voriconazole therapy was 76 days (range 2-232 days).\n\nA satisfactory global response (complete or partial resolution of all attributable symptoms, signs, \nradiographic/bronchoscopic abnormalities present at baseline) was seen in 53% of voriconazole-treated \npatients compared to 31% of patients treated with comparator. The 84-day survival rate for voriconazole was \nstatistically significantly higher than that for the comparator and a clinically and statistically significant \nbenefit was shown in favour of voriconazole for both time to death and time to discontinuation due to \ntoxicity. \n\n\n\n23\n\nThis study confirmed findings from an earlier, prospectively designed study where there was a positive \noutcome in subjects with risk factors for a poor prognosis, including graft versus host disease, and, in \nparticular, cerebral infections (normally associated with almost 100% mortality). \n\nThe studies included cerebral, sinus, pulmonary and disseminated aspergillosis in patients with bone \nmarrow and solid organ transplants, haematological malignancies, cancer and AIDS. \n\nCandidaemia in non-neutropenic patients \nThe efficacy of voriconazole compared to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in the \nprimary treatment of candidaemia was demonstrated in an open, comparative study. Three hundred and \nseventy non-neutropenic patients (above 12 years of age) with documented candidaemia were included in the \nstudy, of whom 248 were treated with voriconazole. Nine subjects in the voriconazole group and 5 in the \namphotericin B followed by fluconazole group also had mycologically proven infection in deep tissue. \nPatients with renal failure were excluded from this study. The median treatment duration was 15 days in both \ntreatment arms. In the primary analysis, successful response as assessed by a Data Review Committee \n(DRC) blinded to study medicinal product was defined as resolution/improvement in all clinical signs and \nsymptoms of infection with eradication of Candida from blood and infected deep tissue sites 12 weeks after \nthe end of therapy (EOT). Patients who did not have an assessment 12 weeks after EOT were counted as \nfailures. In this analysis a successful response was seen in 41% of patients in both treatment arms.\n\nIn a secondary analysis, which utilised DRC assessments at the latest evaluable time point (EOT, or 2, 6, or \n12 weeks after EOT) voriconazole and the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole had \nsuccessful response rates of 65% and 71%, respectively. \n\nThe Investigator’s assessment of successful outcome at each of these time points is shown in the following \ntable. \n\nTimepoint Voriconazole \n(N=248)  \n\nAmphotericin B \n→ fluconazole \n(N=122)\n\nEOT 178 (72%) 88 (72%) \n2 weeks after \nEOT \n\n125 (50%) 62 (51%)\n\n6 weeks after \nEOT \n\n104 (42%) 55 (45%)\n\n12 weeks after \nEOT \n\n104 (42%) 51 (42%)\n\nSerious refractory Candida infections \nThe study comprised 55 patients with serious refractory systemic Candida infections (including \ncandidaemia, disseminated and other invasive candidiasis) where prior antifungal treatment, particularly with \nfluconazole, had been ineffective. Successful response was seen in 24 patients (15 complete, 9 partial \nresponses). In fluconazole-resistant non-albicans species, a successful outcome was seen in 3/3 C. krusei\n(complete responses) and 6/8 C. glabrata (5 complete, 1 partial response) infections. The clinical efficacy \ndata were supported by limited susceptibility data. \n\nScedosporium and Fusarium infections \nVoriconazole was shown to be effective against the following rare fungal pathogens: \n\nScedosporium spp.: Successful response to voriconazole therapy was seen in 16 (6 complete, 10 partial \nresponses) of 28 patients with S. apiospermum and in 2 (both partial responses) of 7 patients with \nS. prolificans infection. In addition, a successful response was seen in 1 of 3 patients with infections \ncaused by more than one organism including Scedosporium spp. \n\nFusarium spp.: Seven (3 complete, 4 partial responses) of 17 patients were successfully treated with \n\n\n\n24\n\nvoriconazole. Of these 7 patients, 3 had eye, 1 had sinus, and 3 had disseminated infection. Four additional \npatients with fusariosis had an infection caused by several organisms; 2 of them had a successful outcome. \n\nThe majority of patients receiving voriconazole treatment of the above mentioned rare infections were \nintolerant of, or refractory to, prior antifungal therapy. \n\nPrimary Prophylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections – Efficacy in HSCT recipients without prior proven or \nprobable IFI\nVoriconazole was compared to itraconazole as primary prophylaxis in an open-label, comparative, \nmulticenter study of adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI. \nSuccess was defined as the ability to continue study drug prophylaxis for 100 days after HSCT (without \nstopping for >14 days) and survival with no proven or probable IFI for 180 days after HSCT. The modified \nintent-to-treat (MITT) group included 465 allogeneic HSCT recipients with 45% of patients having AML. \nFrom all patients 58% were subject to myeloablative conditions regimens. Prophylaxis with study drug was \nstarted immediately after HSCT: 224 received voriconazole and 241 received itraconazole. The median \nduration of study drug prophylaxis was 96 days for voriconazole and 68 days for itraconazole in the MITT \ngroup.\n\nSuccess rates and other secondary endpoints are presented in the table below:\n\nStudy Endpoints Voriconazole\nN=224\n\nItraconazole\nN=241\n\nDifference in \nproportions and the \n\n95% confidence \ninterval (CI) \n\nP-Value\n\nSuccess at day 180* 109 (48.7%) 80 (33.2%) 16.4% (7.7%, 25.1%)** 0.0002**\nSuccess at day 100 121 (54.0%) 96 (39.8%) 15.4% (6.6%, 24.2%)** 0.0006**\nCompleted at least 100 days of \nstudy drug prophylaxis \n\n120 (53.6%) 94 (39.0%) 14.6% (5.6%, 23.5%) 0.0015\n\nSurvived to day 180 184 (82.1%) 197 (81.7%) 0.4% (-6.6%, 7.4%) 0.9107\nDeveloped proven or probable IFI \nto day 180\n\n3 (1.3%) 5 (2.1%) -0.7% (-3.1%, 1.6%) 0.5390\n\nDeveloped proven or probable IFI \nto day 100\n\n2 (0.9%) 4 (1.7%) -0.8% (-2.8%, 1.3%) 0.4589\n\nDeveloped proven or probable IFI \nwhile on study drug\n\n0 3 (1.2%) -1.2% (-2.6%, 0.2%) 0.0813\n\n* Primary endpoint of the study\n** Difference in proportions, 95% CI and p-valuesobtained after adjustment for randomization\n\nThe breakthrough IFI rate to Day 180 and the primary endpoint of the study, which is Success at Day 180, \nfor patients with AML and myeloablative conditioning regimens respectively, is presented in the table \nbelow:\n\nAML\n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazole \n(N=98) \n\nItraconazole\n(N=109)\n\nDifference in proportions and \nthe 95% confidence interval \n\n(CI)\nBreakthrough IFI – Day 180 1 (1.0%) 2 (1.8%) -0.8% (-4.0%, 2.4%) **\n\nSuccess at Day 180* 55 (56.1%) 45 (41.3%) 14.7% (1.7%, 27.7%)***\n\n*   Primary endpoint of study\n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated \n***Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization\n\n\n\n25\n\nMyeloablative conditioning regimens\n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazole \n(N=125) \n\nItraconazole\n(N=143)\n\nDifference in proportions and \nthe 95% confidence interval \n\n(CI)\nBreakthrough IFI – Day 180 2 (1.6%) 3 (2.1%) -0.5% (-3.7%, 2.7%) **\n\nSuccess at Day 180* 70 (56.0%) 53 (37.1%) 20.1% (8.5%, 31.7%)***\n\n*  Primary endpoint of study\n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated \n*** Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization \n\nSecondary Prophylaxis of IFI – Efficacy in HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI\nVoriconazole was investigated as secondary prophylaxis in an open-label, non-comparative, multicenter \nstudy of adult allogeneic HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI. The primary endpoint was the \nrate of occurrence of proven and probable IFI during the first year after HSCT. The MITT group included 40 \npatients with prior IFI, including 31 with aspergillosis, 5 with candidiasis, and 4 with other IFI. The median \nduration of study drug prophylaxis was 95.5 days in the MITT group.\n\nProven or probable IFIs developed in 7.5% (3/40) of patients during the first year after HSCT, including one \ncandidemia, one scedosporiosis (both relapses of prior IFI), and one zygomycosis. The survival rate at Day \n180 was 80.0% (32/40) and at 1 year was 70.0% (28/40).\n\nDuration of treatment\nIn clinical trials, 705 patients received voriconazole therapy for greater than 12 weeks, with 164 patients \nreceiving voriconazole for over 6 months. \n\nPaediatric population\nFifty-three paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years were treated with voriconazole in two prospective, open-\nlabel, non-comparative, multi-center clinical trials. One study enrolled 31 patients with possible, proven or \nprobable invasive aspergillosis (IA), of whom 14 patients had proven or probable IA and were included in \nthe MITT efficacy analyses. The second study enrolled 22 patients with invasive candidiasis including \ncandidaemia (ICC), and esophageal candidiasis (EC) requiring either primary or salvage therapy, of whom \n17 were included in the MITT efficacy analyses. For patients with IA the overall rates of global response at 6 \nweeks were 64.3% (9/14), the global response rate was 40% (2/5) for patients 2 to <12 years and 77.8% (7/9) \nfor patients 12 to <18 years of age. For patients with ICC the global response rate at EOT was 85.7% (6/7) \nand for patients with EC the global response rate at EOT was 70% (7/10). The overall rate of response (ICC \nand EC combined) was 88.9% (8/9) for 2 to <12 years old and 62.5% (5/8) for 12 to <18 years old.\n\nClinical studies examining QTc interval \nA placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QTc interval of \nhealthy volunteers was conducted with three oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. The placebo-\nadjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1200 and 1600 mg of voriconazole were \n5.1, 4.8, and 8.2 msec, respectively and 7.0 msec for ketoconazole 800 mg. No subject in any group had an \nincrease in QTc of ≥ 60 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially \nclinically-relevant threshold of 500 msec.  \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nGeneral pharmacokinetic characteristics \nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterised in healthy subjects, special populations and \npatients. During oral administration of 200 mg or 300 mg twice daily for 14 days in patients at risk of \naspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or haematopoietic tissue), the observed \npharmacokinetic characteristics of rapid and consistent absorption, accumulation and non-linear \npharmacokinetics were in agreement with those observed in healthy subjects. \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. Greater than \n\n\n\n26\n\nproportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, \nincreasing the oral dose from 200 mg twice daily to 300 mg twice daily leads to a 2.5-fold increase in \nexposure (AUCτ). The oral maintenance dose of 200 mg (or 100 mg for patients less than 40 kg) achieves a \nvoriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg IV. A 300 mg (or 150 mg for patients less than 40 kg) oral \nmaintenance dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg IV. When the recommended intravenous or oral \nloading dose regimens are administered, plasma concentrations close to steady state are achieved within the \nfirst 24 hours of dosing. Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during twice daily multiple dosing \nwith steady-state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by Day 6 in the majority of subjects. \n\nAbsorption \nVoriconazole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, with maximum \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved 1-2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of voriconazole \nafter oral administration is estimated to be 96%. When multiple doses of voriconazole are administered with \nhigh fat meals, Cmax and AUCτ are reduced by 34% and 24%, respectively. The absorption of voriconazole is \nnot affected by changes in gastric pH. \n\nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive \ndistribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58%. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from \neight patients in a compassionate programme showed detectable voriconazole concentrations in all patients. \n\nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \nCYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. \n\nThe inter-individual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. \n\nIn vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This \nenzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism. For example, 15-20% of Asian populations may be expected to be \npoor metabolisers. For Caucasians and Blacks the prevalence of poor metabolisers is 3-5%. Studies \nconducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolisers have, on average, \n4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUCτ) than their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts. \nSubjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolisers have on average 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure \nthan their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts.\n\nThe major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating \nradiolabelled metabolites in plasma. This metabolite has minimal antifungal activity and does not \ncontribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole. \n\nElimination\nVoriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged in the \nurine.  \n\nAfter administration of a radiolabelled dose of voriconazole, approximately 80% of the radioactivity is \nrecovered in the urine after multiple intravenous dosing and 83% in the urine after multiple oral dosing. The \nmajority (>94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous \ndosing. \n\nThe terminal half-life of voriconazole depends on dose and is approximately 6 hours at 200 mg (orally). \nBecause of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life is not useful in the prediction of the \naccumulation or elimination of voriconazole. \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n\nGender \nIn an oral multiple -dose study, Cmax and AUCτ for healthy young females were 83% and 113% higher, \nrespectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). In the same study, no significant differences in Cmax\nand AUCτ were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (≥65 years). \n\n\n\n27\n\nIn the clinical programme, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of gender. The safety profile and \nplasma concentrations observed in male and female patients were similar. Therefore, no dosage adjustment \nbased on gender is necessary. \n\nElderly\nIn an oral multiple-dose study Cmax and AUCτ in healthy elderly males (≥65 years) were 61% and 86% \nhigher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). No significant differences in Cmax and AUCτ \nwere observed between healthy elderly females (≥ 65 years) and healthy young females (18-45 years). \n\nIn the therapeutic studies no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. A relationship between plasma \nconcentrations and age was observed. The safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly patients was \nsimilar and, therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 4.2). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe recommended doses in children and adolescent patients are based on a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis of data obtained from 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years and 26 \nimmunocompromised adolescent patients aged 12 to <17 years. Multiple intravenous doses of 3, 4, 6, 7 and \n8 mg/kg twice daily and multiple oral doses (using the powder for oral suspension) of 4 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and \n200 mg twice daily were evaluated in 3 paediatric pharmacokinetic studies. Intravenous loading doses of \n6 mg/kg IV twice daily on day 1 followed by 4 mg/kg intravenous dose twice daily and 300 mg oral tablets \ntwice daily were evaluated in one adolescent pharmacokinetic study. Larger inter-subject variability was \nobserved in paediatric patients compared to adults.\n\nA comparison of the paediatric and adult population pharmacokinetic data indicated that the predicted total \nexposure (AUC) in children following administration of a 9 mg/kg IV loading dose was comparable to that \nin adults following a 6 mg/kg IV loading dose. The predicted total exposures in children following IV \nmaintenance doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg twice daily were comparable to those in adults following 3 and 4 mg/kg \nIV twice daily, respectively. The predicted total exposure in children following an oral maintenance dose of \n9 mg/kg (maximum of 350 mg) twice daily was comparable to that in adults following 200 mg oral twice \ndaily. An 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a \n9 mg/kg oral dose.\n\nThe higher intravenous maintenance dose in paediatric patients relative to adults reflects the higher \nelimination capacity in paediatric patients due to a greater liver mass to body mass ratio. Oral bioavailability \nmay, however, be limited in paediatric patients with malabsorption and very low body weight for their age. \nIn that case, intravenous voriconazole administration is recommended. \n\nVoriconazole exposures in the majority of adolescent patients were comparable to those in adults receiving \nthe same dosing regimens. However, lower voriconazole exposure was observed in some young adolescents \nwith low body weight compared to adults. It is likely that these subjects may metabolize voriconazole more \nsimilarly to children than to adults. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, 12- to 14-year-old \nadolescents weighing less than 50 kg should receive children’s doses (see section 4.2). \n\nRenal impairment\nIn an oral single-dose (200 mg) study in subjects with normal renal function and mild (creatinine clearance \n41-60 ml/min) to severe (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) renal impairment, the pharmacokinetics of \nvoriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment. The plasma protein binding of \nvoriconazole was similar in subjects with different degrees of renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nHepatic impairment \nAfter an oral single-dose (200 mg), AUC was 233% higher in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \ncirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Protein binding of \nvoriconazole was not affected by impaired hepatic function. \n\nIn an oral multiple-dose study, AUCτ was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh \nB) given a maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily and subjects with normal hepatic function given \n200 mg twice daily. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis \n\n\n\n28\n\n(Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies with voriconazole indicated the liver to be the target organ. Hepatotoxicity \noccurred at plasma exposures similar to those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, in common with \nother antifungal agents. In rats, mice and dogs, voriconazole also induced minimal adrenal changes. \nConventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential did not reveal a special \nhazard for humans. \n\nIn reproduction studies, voriconazole was shown to be teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits at \nsystemic exposures equal to those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses. In the pre- and post-natal \ndevelopment study in rats at exposures lower than those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses, \nvoriconazole prolonged the duration of gestation and labour and produced dystocia with consequent maternal \nmortality and reduced perinatal survival of pups. The effects on parturition are probably mediated by \nspecies-specific mechanisms, involving reduction of oestradiol levels, and are consistent with those observed \nwith other azole antifungal agents. Voriconazole administration induced no impairment of male or female \nfertility in rats at exposures similar to those obtained in humans at therapeutic doses.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nVFEND, is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal agent and is indicated in adults and children aged 2 years \nand above as follows:\n\nTreatment of invasive aspergillosis.\n\nTreatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients.\n\nTreatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei).\n\nTreatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.\n\nVFEND should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-threatening infections.\n\nProphylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) \nrecipients.\n\n\n\n31\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nPosology\nElectrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored \nand corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nIt is recommended that VFEND is administered at a maximum rate of 3 mg/kg per hour over 1 to 3 hours. \n\nVFEND is also available as 50 mg and 200 mg film-coated tablets and 40 mg/ml powder for oral \nsuspension. \n\nTreatment\nAdults\nTherapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either intravenous or oral VFEND to \nachieve plasma concentrations on Day 1 that are close to steady state. On the basis of the high oral \nbioavailability (96%; see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and oral administration is appropriate \nwhen clinically indicated. \n\nDetailed information on dosage recommendations is provided in the following table: \n\nIntravenous Oral \n\nPatients 40 kg and\nabove*\n\nPatients less than \n40 kg*\n\nLoading dose \nregimen \n(first 24 hours) \n\n6 mg/kg every 12 \nhours\n\n400 mg every 12 \nhours\n\n200 mg every 12 \nhours\n\nMaintenance dose \n(after first 24 \nhours) \n\n4 mg/kg twice daily 200 mg twice daily 100 mg twice daily\n\n* This also applies to patients aged 15 years and older\n\nDuration of treatment\nTreatment duration should be as short as possible depending on the patient’s clinical and mycological \nresponse. Long term exposure to voriconazole greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful \nassessment of the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nDosage adjustment (Adults)\nIf patient is unable to tolerate intravenous treatment at 4 mg/kg twice daily, reduce the dose to 3 mg/kg twice \ndaily. \n\nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the maintenance dose may be increased to 300 mg twice daily \nfor oral administration. For patients less than 40 kg the oral dose may be increased to 150 mg twice daily.\n\nIf patient is unable to tolerate treatment at a higher dose reduce the oral dose by 50 mg steps to the 200 mg \ntwice daily (or 100 mg twice daily for patients less than 40 kg) maintenance dose.\n\nIn case of use as prophylaxis, refer below.\n\nChildren (2 to <12 years) and young adolescents with low body weight (12 to 14 years and <50 kg)\nVoriconazole should be dosed as children as these young adolescents may metabolize voriconazole more \nsimilarly to children than to adults.\n\nThe recommended dosing regimen is as follows: \n\n\n\n32\n\nIntravenous Oral\nLoading Dose Regimen\n(first 24 hours)\n\n9 mg/kg every 12 hours Not recommended\n\nMaintenance Dose\n(after first 24 hours)\n\n8 mg/kg twice daily \n9 mg/kg twice daily \n(a maximum dose of 350 mg \ntwice daily)\n\nNote: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged \n2 to <12 years and 26 immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to <17 years. \n\nIt is recommended to initiate the therapy with intravenous regimen, and oral regimen should be considered \nonly after there is a significant clinical improvement. It should be noted that an 8 mg/kg intravenous dose \nwill provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose. \n\nAll other adolescents (12 to 14 years and ≥50 kg; 15 to 17 years regardless of body weight)\nVoriconazole should be dosed as adults.\n\nDosage adjustment (Children [2 to <12 years] and young adolescents with low body weight [12 to 14 years \nand <50 kg])\nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the intravenous dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps. If \npatient is unable to tolerate treatment, reduce the intravenous dose by 1 mg/kg steps.\n\nUse in paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\nProphylaxis in Adults and Children\nProphylaxis should be initiated on the day of transplant and may be administered for up to 100 days. \nProphylaxis should be as short as possible depending on the risk for developing invasive fungal \ninfection (IFI) as defined by neutropenia or immunosuppression. It may only be continued up to 180 \ndays after transplantation in case of continuing immunosuppression or graft versus host disease \n(GvHD) (see section 5.1). \n\nDosage \nThe recommended dosing regimen for prophylaxis is the same as for treatment in the respective age groups. \nPlease refer to the treatment tables above.\n\nDuration of prophylaxis\nThe safety and efficacy of voriconazole use for longer than 180 days has not been adequately studied in \nclinical trials.\n\nUse of voriconazole in prophylaxis for greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment of the \nbenefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nThe following instructions apply to both Treatment and Prophylaxis\n\nDosage adjustment\nFor prophylaxis use, dose adjustments are not recommended in the case of lack of efficacy or treatment-\nrelated adverse events. In the case of treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation of voriconazole and \nuse of alternative antifungal agents must be considered (see section 4.4 and 4.8)\n\nDosage adjustments in case of co-administration\nRifabutin or phenytoin may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of \nvoriconazole is increased to 5 mg/kg intravenously twice daily, see sections 4.4 and 4.5. \n\nEfavirenz may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased to \n400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose is reduced by 50%, i.e. to 300 mg once daily. When treatment \nwith voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n33\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min), accumulation of the \nintravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an \nassessment of the risk benefit to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine \nlevels should be closely monitored in these patients and, if increases occur, consideration should be given to \nchanging to oral voriconazole therapy (see section 5.2). \n\nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. A 4-hour haemodialysis session does not \nremove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment. \n\nThe intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is haemodialysed with a clearance of 55 ml/min. \n\nHepatic impairment\nIt is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved \nin patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) receiving voriconazole (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nVoriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe chronic hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C). \n\nThere is limited data on the safety of VFEND in patients with abnormal liver function tests (aspartate \ntransaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], or total bilirubin >5 times the \nupper limit of normal).\n\nVoriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, \nsuch as jaundice, and must only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs \nthe potential risk. Patients with severe hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity (see \nsection 4.8). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of VFEND in children below 2 years has not been established. Currently available \ndata are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n\nMethod of administration\nVFEND requires reconstitution and dilution (see section 6.6) prior to administration as an intravenous \ninfusion. Not for bolus injection. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCoadministration with CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine since \nincreased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare \noccurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration with rifampicin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital since these medicinal products are \nlikely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg once daily or \nhigher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole \nconcentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz \nplasma concentrations (see section 4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4).\n\nCoadministration with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg and above twice daily) because ritonavir \nsignificantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at this dose (see section \n4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n34\n\nCoadministration with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine), which are CYP3A4 substrates, \nsince increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to ergotism (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration with sirolimus since voriconazole is likely to increase plasma concentrations of \nsirolimus significantly (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration with St. John’s Wort (see section 4.5). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nHypersensitivity\nCaution should be used in prescribing VFEND to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles (see also \nsection 4.8). \n\nDuration of treatment\nThe duration of treatment with the intravenous formulation should be no longer than 6 months (see section \n5.3).\n\nCardiovascular\nVoriconazole has been associated with QTc interval prolongation. There have been rare cases of torsades de \npointes in patients taking voriconazole who had risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, \ncardiomyopathy, hypokalaemia and concomitant medicinal products that may have been contributory. \nVoriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, \nsuch as:\n\n Congenital or acquired QTc-prolongation.\n Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present.\n Sinus bradycardia.\n Existing symptomatic arrhythmias.\n Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QTc interval. Electrolyte disturbances such \n\nas hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored and corrected, if \nnecessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.2). A study has been \nconducted in healthy volunteers which examined the effect on QTc interval of single doses of \nvoriconazole up to 4 times the usual daily dose. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the \npotentially clinically-relevant threshold of 500 msec (see section 5.1). \n\nInfusion-related reactions\nInfusion-related reactions, predominantly flushing and nausea, have been observed during administration \nof the intravenous formulation of voriconazole. Depending on the severity of symptoms, consideration \nshould be given to stopping treatment (see section 4.8). \n\nHepatic toxicity\nIn clinical trials, there have been cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole \n(including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of \nhepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions \n(predominantly haematological malignancy). Transient hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, \nhave occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been \nreversible on discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.8). \n\nMonitoring of hepatic function\nPatients receiving VFEND must be carefully monitored for hepatic toxicity. Clinical management should \ninclude laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (specifically AST and ALT) at the initiation of treatment \nwith VFEND and at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Treatment duration should be as short as \npossible; however, if based on the benefit-risk assessment the treatment is continued (see section 4.2), \nmonitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly if there are no changes in the liver function tests. \n\n\n\n35\n\nIf the liver function tests become markedly elevated, VFEND should be discontinued, unless the medical \njudgment of the risk-benefit of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use. \n\nMonitoring of hepatic function should be carried out in both children and adults.\n\nSerious dermatological adverse reactions\n\n Phototoxicity\nIn addition VFEND has been associated with phototoxicity including reactions such as ephelides, \nlentigo, actinic keratosis and pseudoporphyria. It is recommended that all patients, including \nchildren, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment and use measures such as \nprotective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF).\n\n Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC)\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin has been reported in patients, some of whom have reported \nprior phototoxic reactions. If phototoxic reactions occur multidisciplinary advice should be sought, \nVFEND discontinuation and use of alternative antifungal agents should be considered and the \npatient should be referred to a dermatologist. If VFEND is continued, however, dermatologic \nevaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis, to allow early detection and \nmanagement of premalignant lesions. VFEND should be discontinued if premalignant skin lesions or \nsquamous cell carcinoma are identified (see below the section under Long-term treatment).\n\n Exfoliative cutaneous reactions\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS),\nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported with the use of voriconazole. If a patient \ndevelops a rash he should be monitored closely and VFEND discontinued if lesions progress.\n\nLong-term treatment\nLong term exposure (treatment or prophylaxis) greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful \nassessment of the benefit-risk balance and physicians should therefore consider the need to limit the \nexposure to VFEND (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) has been reported in relation with long-term VFEND \ntreatment.\n\nNon-infectious periostitis with elevated fluoride and alkaline phosphatase levels has been reported in \ntransplant patients. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with \nperiostitis VFEND discontinuation should be considered after multidisciplinary advice.\n\nVisual adverse reactions\nThere have been reports of prolonged visual adverse reactions, including blurred vision, optic neuritis and \npapilloedema (see section 4.8).\n\nRenal adverse reactions\nAcute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients\nbeing treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medicinal products\nand have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function (see section 4.8). \n\nMonitoring of renal function\nPatients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include \nlaboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. \n\nMonitoring of pancreatic function\nPatients, especially children, with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]), should be monitored closely during VFEND treatment. \nMonitoring of serum amylase or lipase may be considered in this clinical situation. \n\n\n\n36\n\nPaediatric population\nSafety and effectiveness in paediatric subjects below the age of two years has not been established (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). Voriconazole is indicated for paediatric patients aged two years or older. A higher \nfrequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the paediatric population (see section 4.8). Hepatic \nfunction should be monitored in both children and adults. Oral bioavailability may be limited in paediatric \npatients aged 2 to <12 years with malabsorption and very low body weight for age. In that case, intravenous \nvoriconazole administration is recommended. \n\n Serious dermatological adverse reactions (including SCC)\nThe frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the paediatric population. As an evolution \ntowards SCC has been reported, stringent measures for the photoprotection are warranted in this \npopulation of patients. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, \nsun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation.\n\nProphylaxis\nIn case of treatment-related adverse events (hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions including phototoxicity and \nSCC, severe or prolonged visual disorders and periostitis), discontinuation of voriconazole and use of \nalternative antifungal agents must be considered.\n\nPhenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate and potent CYP450 inducer)\nCareful monitoring of phenytoin levels is recommended when phenytoin is coadministered with \nvoriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and phenytoin should be avoided unless the benefit \noutweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n\nEfavirenz (CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate)\nWhen voriconazole is coadministered with efavirenz the dose of voriconazole should be increased to 400 mg \nevery 12 hours and the dose of efavirenz should be decreased to 300 mg every 24 hours (see sections 4.2, 4.3\nand 4.5). \n\nRifabutin (Potent CYP450 inducer)\nCareful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions to rifabutin (e.g., uveitis) is recommended \nwhen rifabutin is coadministered with voriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and rifabutin should \nbe avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n\nRitonavir (potent CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate)\nCoadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided unless an \nassessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\nEverolimus (CYP3A4 substrate, P-gp substrate)\nCoadministration of voriconazole with everolimus is not recommended because voriconazole is expected \nto significantly increase everolimus concentrations. Currently there are insufficient data to allow dosing \nrecommendations in this situation (see section 4.5).\n\nMethadone (CYP3A4 substrate)\nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to methadone, including QTc prolongation, is \nrecommended when coadministered with voriconazole since methadone levels increased following \ncoadministration of voriconazole. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed (see section 4.5). \n\nShort-acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate)\nReduction in the dose of alfentanil, fentanyl and other short-acting opiates similar in structure to alfentanil \nand metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole \n(see section 4.5). As the half-life of alfentanil is prolonged in a 4-fold manner when alfentanil is \ncoadministered with voriconazole, and in an independent published study concomitant use of voriconazole \nwith fentanyl resulted in an increase in the mean AUC0-∞ of fentanyl, frequent monitoring for opiate-\nassociated adverse reactions (including a longer respiratory monitoring period) may be necessary.\n\n\n\n37\n\nLong-acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate)\nReduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., \nhydrocodone) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Frequent monitoring for opiate-\nassociated adverse reactions may be necessary (see section 4.5).\n\nFluconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor)\nCoadministration of oral voriconazole and oral fluconazole resulted in a significant increase in Cmax and \nAUCτ of voriconazole in healthy subjects. The reduced dose and/or frequency of voriconazole and \nfluconazole that would eliminate this effect have not been established. Monitoring for voriconazole-\nassociated adverse reactions is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nSodium content\nEach vial of VFEND contains 217.6 mg of sodium. This should be taken into consideration for patients on a \ncontrolled sodium diet. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nVoriconazole is metabolised by, and inhibits the activity of, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, \nCYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these isoenzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole \nplasma concentrations, respectively, and there is potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma \nconcentrations of substances metabolised by these CYP450 isoenzymes.  \n\nUnless otherwise specified, drug interaction studies have been performed in healthy adult male subjects \nusing multiple dosing to steady state with oral voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily (BID). These results are \nrelevant to other populations and routes of administration. \n\nVoriconazole should be administered with caution in patients with concomitant medication that is known \nto prolong QTc interval. When there is also a potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma \nconcentrations of substances metabolised by CYP3A4 isoenzymes (certain antihistamines, quinidine, \ncisapride, pimozide), coadministration is contraindicated (see below and section 4.3).\n\nInteraction table\nInteractions between voriconazole and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (once daily \nas “QD”, twice daily as “BID”, three times daily as “TID” and not determined as “ND”). The direction of \nthe arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric \nmean ratio being within (↔), below (↓) or above (↑) the 80-125% range. The asterisk (*) indicates a two-\nway interaction. AUC, AUCt and AUC0- represent area under the curve over a dosing interval, from time \nzero to the time with detectable measurement and from time zero to infinity, respectively.\n\nThe interactions in the table are presented in the following order: contraindications, those requiring dose \nadjustment and careful clinical and/or biological monitoring, and finally those that have no significant \npharmacokinetic interaction but may be of clinical interest in this therapeutic field.\n\nMedicinal product\n[Mechanism of interaction]\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean changes (%)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning\ncoadministration\n\nAstemizole, cisapride, \npimozide, quinidine and \nterfenadine\n[CYP3A4 substrates]\n\nAlthough not studied, increased \nplasma concentrations of these \nmedicinal products can lead to QTc \nprolongation and rare occurrences \nof torsades de pointes.\n\nContraindicated (see section \n4.3)\n\nCarbamazepine and long-acting \nbarbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital, \nmephobarbital) \n[potent CYP450 inducers]\n\nAlthough not studied, \ncarbamazepine and long-acting \nbarbiturates are likely to \nsignificantly decrease plasma \nvoriconazole concentrations.\n\nContraindicated (see section \n4.3)\n\n\n\n38\n\nMedicinal product\n[Mechanism of interaction]\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean changes (%)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning\ncoadministration\n\nEfavirenz (a non-nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor) \n[CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 \ninhibitor and substrate]\n\nEfavirenz 400 mg QD,\ncoadministered with \nvoriconazole 200 mg BID*\n\nEfavirenz 300 mg QD, \ncoadministered with \nvoriconazole 400 mg BID*\n\nEfavirenz Cmax  38%\nEfavirenz AUC  44%\nVoriconazole Cmax  61%\nVoriconazole AUC  77%\n\nCompared to efavirenz 600 mg QD,\nEfavirenz Cmax ↔\nEfavirenz AUC  17%\n\nCompared to voriconazole 200 mg \nBID,\nVoriconazole Cmax  23%\nVoriconazole AUC  7%\n\nUse of standard doses of \nvoriconazole with efavirenz \ndoses of 400 mg QD or higher\nis contraindicated (see\nsection 4.3).  \n\nVoriconazole may be \ncoadministered with efavirenz \nif the voriconazole \nmaintenance dose is increased \nto 400 mg BID and the \nefavirenz dose is decreased to \n300 mg QD.

Breast-feeding must be stopped on \ninitiation of treatment with VFEND.\n\nFertility\nIn an animal study, no impairment of fertility was demonstrated in male and female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nVFEND has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It may cause transient and \nreversible changes to vision, including blurring, altered/enhanced visual perception and/or photophobia. \nPatients must avoid potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving or operating machinery while \nexperiencing these symptoms.  \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of safety profile\nThe safety profile of voriconazole in adults is based on an integrated safety database of more than 2,000 \nsubjects (including 1,603 adult patients in therapeutic trials) and an additional 270 adults in prophylaxis \ntrials. This represents a heterogeneous population, containing patients with haematological malignancy, \nHIV-infected patients with oesophageal candidiasis and refractory fungal infections, non-neutropenic \npatients with candidaemia or aspergillosis and healthy volunteers. \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions were visual impairment, pyrexia, rash, vomiting, nausea, \ndiarrhoea, headache, peripheral oedema, liver function test abnormal, respiratory distress and abdominal \npain.\n\nThe severity of the adverse reactions was generally mild to moderate. No clinically significant differences \nwere seen when the safety data were analysed by age, race, or gender. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nIn the table below, since the majority of the studies were of an open nature, all causality adverse reactions\nand their frequency categories in 1,873 adults from pooled therapeutic (1,603) and prophylaxis (270) studies, \nby system organ class, are listed.\n\nFrequency categories are expressed as: Very common (1/10);

These visual impairments were transient and fully reversible, with the \nmajority spontaneously resolving within 60 minutes and no clinically significant long-term visual effects \nwere observed. There was evidence of attenuation with repeated doses of voriconazole. The visual \nimpairments were generally mild, rarely resulted in discontinuation and were not associated with long-term \nsequelae. Visual impairments may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. \n\nThe mechanism of action is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a \nstudy in healthy volunteers investigating the impact of voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused \na decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude. The ERG measures electrical currents in the \nretina. The ERG changes did not progress over 29 days of treatment and were fully reversible on withdrawal \nof voriconazole. \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events (see section 4.4).\n\nDermatological reactions \nDermatological reactions were very common in patients treated with voriconazole in clinical trials, but these \npatients had serious underlying diseases and were receiving multiple concomitant medicinal products. The \nmajority of rashes were of mild to moderate severity. Patients have developed severe cutaneous adverse \nreactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (uncommon), toxic epidermal necrolysis\n(TEN) (rare), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (rare) and erythema \n\n\n\n48\n\nmultiforme (rare) during treatment with VFEND (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a patient develops a rash they should be monitored closely and VFEND discontinued if lesions progress. \nPhotosensitivity reactions such as ephelides, lentigo and actinic keratosis have been reported, especially \nduring long-term therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nThere have been reports of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in patients treated with VFEND for long \nperiods of time; the mechanism has not been established (see section 4.4).\n\nLiver function tests\nThe overall incidence of transaminase increases >3 xULN (not necessarily comprising an adverse event) in \nthe voriconazole clinical programme was 18.0% (319/1,768) in adults and 25.8% (73/283) in paediatric\nsubjects who received voriconazole for pooled therapeutic and prophylaxis use. Liver function test \nabnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal \nliver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment,\nincluding discontinuation of therapy.\n\nVoriconazole has been associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity in patients with other serious \nunderlying conditions. This includes cases of jaundice, hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nInfusion-related reactions \nDuring infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type \nreactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnoea, faintness, nausea, \npruritus and rash have occurred. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion (see section \n4.4). \n\nProphylaxis\nIn an open-label, comparative, multicenter study comparing voriconazole and itraconazole as primary \nprophylaxis in adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI, \npermanent discontinuation of voriconazole due to AEs was reported in 39.3% of subjects versus 39.6% of \nsubjects in the itraconazole arm. Treatment-emergent hepatic AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of \nstudy medication for 50 subjects (21.4%) treated with voriconazole and for 18 subjects (7.1%) treated with \nitraconazole. \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety of voriconazole was investigated in 288 paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years (169) and 12 to \n<18 years (119) who received voriconazole for prophylaxis (183) and therapeutic use (105) in clinical trials. \nThe safety of voriconazole was also investigated in 158 additional paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in \ncompassionate use programs. Overall, the safety profile of voriconazole in paediatric population was similar \nto that in adults. However, a trend towards a higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations, reported as \nadverse events in clinical trials was observed in paediatric patients as compared to adults (14.2% \ntransaminases increased in paediatrics compared to 5.3% in adults). Post-marketing data suggest there might \nbe a higher occurrence of skin reactions (especially erythema) in the paediatric population compared to \nadults. In the 22 patients less than 2 years old who received voriconazole in a compassionate use programme, \nthe following adverse reactions (for which a relationship to voriconazole could not be excluded) were \nreported: photosensitivity reaction (1), arrhythmia (1), pancreatitis (1), blood bilirubin increased (1), hepatic \nenzymes increased (1), rash (1) and papilloedema (1). There have been post-marketing reports of pancreatitis \nin paediatric patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nIn clinical trials there were 3 cases of accidental overdose. All occurred in paediatric patients, who received \n\n\n\n49\n\nup to five times the recommended intravenous dose of voriconazole. A single adverse reaction of \nphotophobia of 10 minutes duration was reported. \n\nThere is no known antidote to voriconazole. \n\nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is \nhaemodialysed with a clearance of 55 ml/min. In an overdose, haemodialysis may assist in the removal of \nvoriconazole and SBECD from the body. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02A \nC03\n\nMode of Action\nVoriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. The primary mode of action of voriconazole is the inhibition of \nfungal cytochrome P450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylation, an essential step in fungal ergosterol \nbiosynthesis. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol \nin the fungal cell membrane and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of voriconazole. Voriconazole \nhas been shown to be more selective for fungal cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for various mammalian \ncytochrome P-450 enzyme systems.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic Relationship\nIn 10 therapeutic studies, the median for the average and maximum plasma concentrations in individual \nsubjects across the studies was 2425 ng/ml (inter-quartile range 1193 to 4380 ng/ml) and 3742 ng/ml (inter-\nquartile range 2027 to 6302 ng/ml), respectively. A positive association between mean, maximum or \nminimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy in therapeutic studies was not found and this \nrelationship has not been explored in prophylaxis studies. \n\nPharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic analyses of clinical trial data identified positive associations \nbetween plasma voriconazole concentrations and both liver function test abnormalities and visual \ndisturbances. Dose adjustments in prophylaxis studies have not been explored.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn vitro, voriconazole displays broad-spectrum antifungal activity with antifungal potency against \nCandida species (including fluconazole -resistant C. krusei and resistant strains of C. glabrata and C. \nalbicans) and fungicidal activity against all Aspergillus species tested. In addition voriconazole shows in \nvitro fungicidal activity against emerging fungal pathogens, including those such as Scedosporium or \nFusarium which have limited susceptibility to existing antifungal agents.\n\nClinical efficacy defined as partial or complete response, has been demonstrated for Aspergillus spp. \nincluding A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. niger, A. nidulans; Candida spp., including C. albicans, C. \nglabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis; and limited numbers of C. dubliniensis, \nC. inconspicua, and C. guilliermondii, Scedosporium spp., including S. apiospermum, S. prolificans; and\nFusarium spp. \n\nOther treated fungal infections (often with either partial or complete response) included isolated cases of \nAlternaria spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Blastoschizomyces capitatus, Cladosporium spp., \nCoccidioides immitis, Conidiobolus coronatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Exserohilum rostratum, \nExophiala spinifera, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Madurella mycetomatis, Paecilomyces lilacinus, \nPenicillium spp. including P. marneffei, Phialophora richardsiae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and \nTrichosporon spp. including T. beigelii infections. \n\nIn vitro activity against clinical isolates has been observed for Acremonium spp., Alternaria spp., \nBipolaris spp., Cladophialophora spp., and Histoplasma capsulatum, with most strains being inhibited by \n\n\n\n50\n\nconcentrations of voriconazole in the range 0.05 to 2 µg/ml. \n\nIn vitro activity against the following pathogens has been shown, but the clinical significance is \nunknown: Curvularia spp. and Sporothrix spp. \n\nBreakpoints\nSpecimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be \nobtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the \nresults of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become \navailable, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. \n\nThe species most frequently involved in causing human infections include C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, \nC. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei, all of which usually exhibit minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs)\nof less than 1 mg/L for voriconazole.  \n\nHowever, the in vitro activity of voriconazole against Candida species is not uniform. Specifically, for \nC. glabrata, the MICs of voriconazole for fluconazole-resistant isolates are proportionally higher than are \nthose of fluconazole-susceptible isolates. Therefore, every attempt should be made to identify Candida to \nspecies level. If antifungal susceptibility testing is available, the MIC results may be interpreted using \nbreakpoint criteria established by European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).\n\nEUCAST Breakpoints\n\nCandida species MIC breakpoint (mg/L)\n≤S (Susceptible) >R (Resistant)\n\nCandida albicans1 0.125 0.125\nCandida tropicalis1 0.125 0.125\nCandida parapsilosis1 0.125 0.125\nCandida glabrata2 Insufficient evidence\nCandida krusei3 Insufficient evidence\nOther Candida spp.4 Insufficient evidence\n1 Strains with MIC values above the Susceptible (S) breakpoint are rare, or \nnot yet reported. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests \non any such isolate must be repeated and if the result is confirmed the \nisolate sent to a reference laboratory. \n2 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in patients with C. glabrata\ninfections was 21% lower compared to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. \ntropicalis. In vitro data showed a slight increase of resistance of C. \nglabrata to voriconazole.\n3 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in C. krusei infections was \nsimilar to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. However, as there \nwere only 9 cases available for EUCAST analysis, there is currently \ninsufficient evidence to set clinical breakpoints for C. krusei. \n4 EUCAST has not determined non-species related breakpoints for \nvoriconazole.\n\nClinical experience \nSuccessful outcome in this section is defined as complete or partial response. \n\nAspergillus infections – efficacy in aspergillosis patients with poor prognosis \nVoriconazole has in vitro fungicidal activity against Aspergillus spp. The efficacy and survival benefit of \nvoriconazole versus conventional amphotericin B in the primary treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis \nwas demonstrated in an open, randomised, multicentre study in 277 immunocompromised patients treated \nfor 12 weeks. Voriconazole was administered intravenously with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours \nfor the first 24 hours followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours for a minimum of 7 days. \nTherapy could then be switched to the oral formulation at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours. Median duration \nof IV voriconazole therapy was 10 days (range 2-85 days). After IV voriconazole therapy, the median \n\n\n\n51\n\nduration of oral voriconazole therapy was 76 days (range 2-232 days).\n\nA satisfactory global response (complete or partial resolution of all attributable symptoms, signs, \nradiographic/bronchoscopic abnormalities present at baseline) was seen in 53% of voriconazole-treated \npatients compared to 31% of patients treated with comparator. The 84-day survival rate for voriconazole was \nstatistically significantly higher than that for the comparator and a clinically and statistically significant \nbenefit was shown in favour of voriconazole for both time to death and time to discontinuation due to \ntoxicity. \n\nThis study confirmed findings from an earlier, prospectively designed study where there was a positive \noutcome in subjects with risk factors for a poor prognosis, including graft versus host disease, and, in \nparticular, cerebral infections (normally associated with almost 100% mortality). \n\nThe studies included cerebral, sinus, pulmonary and disseminated aspergillosis in patients with bone \nmarrow and solid organ transplants, haematological malignancies, cancer and AIDS. \n\nCandidaemia in non-neutropenic patients\nThe efficacy of voriconazole compared to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in the \nprimary treatment of candidaemia was demonstrated in an open, comparative study. Three hundred and \nseventy non-neutropenic patients (above 12 years of age) with documented candidaemia were included in the \nstudy, of whom 248 were treated with voriconazole. Nine subjects in the voriconazole group and 5 in the \namphotericin B followed by fluconazole group also had mycologically proven infection in deep tissue. \nPatients with renal failure were excluded from this study. The median treatment duration was 15 days in both \ntreatment arms. In the primary analysis, successful response as assessed by a Data Review Committee \n(DRC) blinded to study medicinal product was defined as resolution/improvement in all clinical signs and \nsymptoms of infection with eradication of Candida from blood and infected deep tissue sites 12 weeks after \nthe end of therapy (EOT). Patients who did not have an assessment 12 weeks after EOT were counted as \nfailures. In this analysis a successful response was seen in 41% of patients in both treatment arms. \n\nIn a secondary analysis, which utilised DRC assessments at the latest evaluable time point (EOT, or 2, 6, or \n12 weeks after EOT) voriconazole and the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole had \nsuccessful response rates of 65% and 71%, respectively. \n\nThe Investigator’s assessment of successful outcome at each of these time points is shown in the following \ntable. \n\nTimepoint Voriconazole \n(N=248)  \n\nAmphotericin B \n→ fluconazole \n(N=122)\n\nEOT 178 (72%) 88 (72%) \n\n2 weeks after \nEOT \n\n125 (50%) 62 (51%)\n\n6 weeks after \nEOT \n\n104 (42%) 55 (45%)\n\n12 weeks after \nEOT \n\n104 (42%) 51 (42%)\n\nSerious refractory Candida infections \nThe study comprised 55 patients with serious refractory systemic Candida infections (including \ncandidaemia, disseminated and other invasive candidiasis) where prior antifungal treatment, particularly with \nfluconazole, had been ineffective. Successful response was seen in 24 patients (15 complete, 9 partial \nresponses). In fluconazole-resistant non-albicans species, a successful outcome was seen in 3/3 C. krusei\n(complete responses) and 6/8 C. glabrata (5 complete, 1 partial response) infections. The clinical efficacy \ndata were supported by limited susceptibility data. \n\nScedosporium and Fusarium infections \n\n\n\n52\n\nVoriconazole was shown to be effective against the following rare fungal pathogens: \n\nScedosporium spp.: Successful response to voriconazole therapy was seen in 16 (6 complete, 10 partial \nresponses) of 28 patients with S. apiospermum and in 2 (both partial responses) of 7 patients with \nS. prolificans infection. In addition, a successful response was seen in 1 of 3 patients with infections \ncaused by more than one organism including Scedosporium spp. \n\nFusarium spp.: Seven (3 complete, 4 partial responses) of 17 patients were successfully treated with \nvoriconazole. Of these 7 patients, 3 had eye, 1 had sinus, and 3 had disseminated infection. Four additional \npatients with fusariosis had an infection caused by several organisms; 2 of them had a successful outcome. \n\nThe majority of patients receiving voriconazole treatment of the above mentioned rare infections were \nintolerant of, or refractory to, prior antifungal therapy. \n\nPrimary Prophylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections – Efficacy in HSCT recipients without prior proven or \nprobable IFI\nVoriconazole was compared to itraconazole as primary prophylaxis in an open-label, comparative, \nmulticenter study of adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI. \nSuccess was defined as the ability to continue study drug prophylaxis for 100 days after HSCT (without \nstopping for >14 days) and survival with no proven or probable IFI for 180 days after HSCT. The modified \nintent-to-treat (MITT) group included 465 allogeneic HSCT recipients with 45% of patients having AML. \nFrom all patients 58% were subject to myeloablative conditions regimens. Prophylaxis with study drug was \nstarted immediately after HSCT: 224 received voriconazole and 241 received itraconazole. The median \nduration of study drug prophylaxis was 96 days for voriconazole and 68 days for itraconazole in the MITT \ngroup.\n\nSuccess rates and other secondary endpoints are presented in the table below:\n\nStudy Endpoints Voriconazole\nN=224\n\nItraconazole\nN=241\n\nDifference in \nproportions and the \n\n95% confidence \ninterval (CI) \n\nP-Value\n\nSuccess at day 180* 109 (48.7%) 80 (33.2%) 16.4% (7.7%, 25.1%)** 0.0002**\nSuccess at day 100 121 (54.0%) 96 (39.8%) 15.4% (6.6%, 24.2%)** 0.0006**\nCompleted at least 100 days of \nstudy drug prophylaxis \n\n120 (53.6%) 94 (39.0%) 14.6% (5.6%, 23.5%) 0.0015\n\nSurvived to day 180 184 (82.1%) 197 (81.7%) 0.4% (-6.6%, 7.4%) 0.9107\nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI to day 180\n\n3 (1.3%) 5 (2.1%) -0.7% (-3.1%, 1.6%) 0.5390\n\nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI to day 100\n\n2 (0.9%) 4 (1.7%) -0.8% (-2.8%, 1.3%) 0.4589\n\nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI while on study drug\n\n0 3 (1.2%) -1.2% (-2.6%, 0.2%) 0.0813\n\n* Primary endpoint of the study\n** Difference in proportions, 95% CI and p-values obtained after adjustment for randomization\n\nThe breakthrough IFI rate to Day 180 and the primary endpoint of the study, which is Success at Day 180, \nfor patients with AML and myeloablative conditioning regimens respectively, is presented in the table \nbelow:\n\nAML\n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazole \n(N=98) \n\nItraconazole\n(N=109)\n\nDifference in proportions \nand the 95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI)\nBreakthrough IFI – Day 180 1 (1.0%) 2 (1.8%) -0.8% (-4.0%, 2.4%) **\n\n\n\n53\n\nSuccess at Day 180* 55 (56.1%) 45 (41.3%) 14.7% (1.7%, 27.7%)***\n\n*   Primary endpoint of study\n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated \n***Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization\n\nMyeloablative conditioning regimens\n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazole \n(N=125) \n\nItraconazole\n(N=143)\n\nDifference in proportions \nand the 95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI)\nBreakthrough IFI – Day 180 2 (1.6%) 3 (2.1%) -0.5% (-3.7%, 2.7%) **\n\nSuccess at Day 180* 70 (56.0%) 53 (37.1%) 20.1% (8.5%, 31.7%)***\n\n*   Primary endpoint of study\n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated \n*** Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization \n\nSecondary Prophylaxis of IFI – Efficacy in HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI\nVoriconazole was investigated as secondary prophylaxis in an open-label, non-comparative, multicenter \nstudy of adult allogeneic HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI. The primary endpoint was the \nrate of occurrence of proven and probable IFI during the first year after HSCT. The MITT group included 40 \npatients with prior IFI, including 31 with aspergillosis, 5 with candidiasis, and 4 with other IFI.

The survival rate at Day \n180 was 80.0% (32/40) and at 1 year was 70.0% (28/40).\n\nDuration of treatment \nIn clinical trials, 705 patients received voriconazole therapy for greater than 12 weeks, with 164 patients \nreceiving voriconazole for over 6 months. \n\nPaediatric population\nFifty-three paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years were treated with voriconazole in two prospective, open-\nlabel, non-comparative, multi-center clinical trials. One study enrolled 31 patients with possible, proven or \nprobable invasive aspergillosis (IA), of whom 14 patients had proven or probable IA and were included in \nthe MITT efficacy analyses. The second study enrolled 22 patients with invasive candidiasis including \ncandidaemia (ICC), and esophageal candidiasis (EC) requiring either primary or salvage therapy, of whom \n17 were included in the MITT efficacy analyses. For patients with IA the overall rates of global response at 6 \nweeks were 64.3% (9/14), the global response rate was 40% (2/5) for patients 2 to <12 years and 77.8% (7/9) \nfor patients 12 to <18 years of age. For patients with ICC the global response rate at EOT was 85.7% (6/7) \nand for patients with EC the global response rate at EOT was 70% (7/10). The overall rate of response (ICC \nand EC combined) was 88.9% (8/9) for 2 to <12 years old and 62.5% (5/8) for 12 to <18 years old.\n\nClinical studies examining QTc interval \nA placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QTc interval of \nhealthy volunteers was conducted with three oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. The placebo-\nadjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1200 and 1600 mg of voriconazole were \n5.1, 4.8, and 8.2 msec, respectively and 7.0 msec for ketoconazole 800 mg. No subject in any group had an \nincrease in QTc of ≥ 60 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially \nclinically-relevant threshold of 500 msec.  \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nGeneral pharmacokinetic characteristics \nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterised in healthy subjects, special populations and \n\n\n\n54\n\npatients. During oral administration of 200 mg or 300 mg twice daily for 14 days in patients at risk of \naspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or haematopoietic tissue), the observed \npharmacokinetic characteristics of rapid and consistent absorption, accumulation and non-linear \npharmacokinetics were in agreement with those observed in healthy subjects. \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. Greater than \nproportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, \nincreasing the oral dose from 200 mg twice daily to 300 mg twice daily leads to a 2.5-fold increase in \nexposure (AUCτ). The oral maintenance dose of 200 mg (or 100 mg for patients less than 40 kg) achieves a \nvoriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg IV. A 300 mg (or 150 mg for patients less than 40 kg) oral \nmaintenance dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg IV. When the recommended intravenous or oral \nloading dose regimens are administered, plasma concentrations close to steady state are achieved within the \nfirst 24 hours of dosing. Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during twice daily multiple dosing \nwith steady-state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by Day 6 in the majority of subjects. \n\nAbsorption \nVoriconazole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, with maximum \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved 1-2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of voriconazole \nafter oral administration is estimated to be 96%. When multiple doses of voriconazole are administered with \nhigh fat meals, Cmax and AUCτ are reduced by 34% and 24%, respectively. The absorption of voriconazole is \nnot affected by changes in gastric pH. \n\nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive \ndistribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58%. \n\nCerebrospinal fluid samples from eight patients in a compassionate programme showed detectable \nvoriconazole concentrations in all patients. \n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \nCYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.\n\nThe inter-individual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. \n\nIn vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This \nenzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism. For example, 15-20% of Asian populations may be expected to be \npoor metabolisers. For Caucasians and Blacks the prevalence of poor metabolisers is 3-5%. Studies \nconducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolisers have, on average, \n4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUCτ) than their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts. \nSubjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolisers have on average 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure \nthan their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts. \n\nThe major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating \nradiolabelled metabolites in plasma. This metabolite has minimal antifungal activity and does not\ncontribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole.\n\nElimination \nVoriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged in the \nurine.  \n\nAfter administration of a radiolabelled dose of voriconazole, approximately 80% of the radioactivity is \nrecovered in the urine after multiple intravenous dosing and 83% in the urine after multiple oral dosing. The \nmajority (>94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous \ndosing. \n\nThe terminal half-life of voriconazole depends on dose and is approximately 6 hours at 200 mg (orally). \nBecause of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life is not useful in the prediction of the \n\n\n\n55\n\naccumulation or elimination of voriconazole. \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n\nGender \nIn an oral multiple-dose study, Cmax and AUCτ for healthy young females were 83% and 113% higher, \nrespectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). In the same study, no significant differences in Cmax\nand AUCτ were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (≥65 years). \n\nIn the clinical programme, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of gender. The safety profile and \nplasma concentrations observed in male and female patients were similar. Therefore, no dosage adjustment \nbased on gender is necessary. \n\nElderly \nIn an oral multiple-dose study Cmax and AUCτ in healthy elderly males (≥65 years) were 61% and 86% \nhigher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). No significant differences in Cmax and AUCτ \nwere observed between healthy elderly females (≥65 years) and healthy young females (18-45 years). \n\nIn the therapeutic studies no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. A relationship between plasma \nconcentrations and age was observed. The safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly patients was \nsimilar and, therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe recommended doses in children and adolescent patients are based on a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis of data obtained from 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years and 26 \nimmunocompromised adolescent patients aged 12 to <17 years. Multiple intravenous doses of 3, 4, 6, 7 and \n8 mg/kg twice daily and multiple oral doses (using the powder for oral suspension) of 4 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and \n200 mg twice daily were evaluated in 3 paediatric pharmacokinetic studies. Intravenous loading doses of \n6 mg/kg IV twice daily on day 1 followed by 4 mg/kg intravenous dose twice daily and 300 mg oral tablets \ntwice daily were evaluated in one adolescent pharmacokinetic study. Larger inter-subject variability was \nobserved in paediatric patients compared to adults. \n\nA comparison of the paediatric and adult population pharmacokinetic data indicated that the predicted total \nexposure (AUC) in children following administration of a 9 mg/kg IV loading dose was comparable to that \nin adults following a 6 mg/kg IV loading dose. The predicted total exposures in children following IV \nmaintenance doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg twice daily were comparable to those in adults following 3 and \n4 mg/kg IV twice daily, respectively. The predicted total exposure in children following an oral \nmaintenance dose of 9 mg/kg (maximum of 350 mg) twice daily was comparable to that in adults following \n200 mg oral twice daily. An 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately \n2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose.\n\nThe higher intravenous maintenance dose in paediatric patients relative to adults reflects the higher \nelimination capacity in paediatric patients due to a greater liver mass to body mass ratio. Oral \nbioavailability may, however, be limited in paediatric patients with malabsorption and very low body \nweight for their age. In that case, intravenous voriconazole administration is recommended.\n\nVoriconazole exposures in the majority of adolescent patients were comparable to those in adults receiving \nthe same dosing regimens. However, lower voriconazole exposure was observed in some young adolescents \nwith low body weight compared to adults. It is likely that these subjects may metabolize voriconazole more \nsimilarly to children than to adolescents/adults. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, 12- to 14-\nyear-old adolescents weighing less than 50 kg should receive children’s doses (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment \nIn patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (serum creatinine levels > 2.5 mg/dl), accumulation of \nthe intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nHepatic impairment \nAfter an oral single-dose (200 mg), AUC was 233% higher in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \n\n\n\n56\n\ncirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Protein binding of \nvoriconazole was not affected by impaired hepatic function.\n\nIn an oral multiple-dose study, AUCτ was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh \nB) given a maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily and subjects with normal hepatic function given \n200 mg twice daily. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis \n(Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies with voriconazole indicated the liver to be the target organ. Hepatotoxicity \noccurred at plasma exposures similar to those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, in common with \nother antifungal agents. In rats, mice and dogs, voriconazole also induced minimal adrenal changes. \nConventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential did not reveal a special \nhazard for humans. \n\nIn reproduction studies, voriconazole was shown to be teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits at \nsystemic exposures equal to those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses. In the pre- and post-natal \ndevelopment study in rats at exposures lower than those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses, \nvoriconazole prolonged the duration of gestation and labour and produced dystocia with consequent maternal \nmortality and reduced perinatal survival of pups. The effects on parturition are probably mediated by \nspecies-specific mechanisms, involving reduction of oestradiol levels, and are consistent with those observed \nwith other azole antifungal agents. Voriconazole administration induced no impairment of male or female \nfertility in rats at exposures similar to those obtained in humans at therapeutic doses.\n\nPreclinical data on the intravenous vehicle SBECD indicated that the main effects were vacuolation of \nurinary tract epithelium and activation of macrophages in the liver and lungs in the repeated-dose toxicity \nstudies. As GPMT (guinea pig maximisation test) result was positive, prescribers should be aware of the \nhypersensitivity potential of the intravenous formulation. Standard genotoxicity and reproduction studies \nwith the excipient SBECD reveal no special hazard for humans. Carcinogenicity studies were not performed \nwith SBECD. An impurity present in SBECD has been shown to be an alkylating mutagenic agent with \nevidence for carcinogenicity in rodents. This impurity should be considered a substance with carcinogenic \npotential in humans. In light of these data the duration of treatment with the intravenous formulation should \nbe no longer than 6 months. \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n\nPowder for solution for infusion:\nSulfobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium (SBECD)\n\nSolvent for solution for infusion:\nSodium chloride 0.9% in Water for Injections\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\nVFEND must not be infused into the same line or cannula concomitantly with other intravenous \nproducts. The bag should be checked to ensure that the infusion is complete. When the VFEND infusion \nis complete, the line may be used for administration of other intravenous products.\n\nBlood products and short-term infusion of concentrated solutions of electrolytes: Electrolyte disturbances \nsuch as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be corrected prior to initiation of \nvoriconazole therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). VFEND must not be administered simultaneously with any \nblood product or any short-term infusion of concentrated solutions of electrolytes, even if the two infusions \nare running in separate lines. \n\n\n\n57\n\nTotal parenteral nutrition: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) need not be discontinued when prescribed with \nVFEND, but does need to be infused through a separate line. If infused through a multiple-lumen catheter, \nTPN needs to be administered using a different port from the one used for VFEND. VFEND must not be \ndiluted with 4.2% Sodium Bicarbonate Infusion. Compatibility with other concentrations is unknown. \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6.\n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\nVFEND 200 mg powder for solution for infusion and VFEND 200 mg powder and solvent for solution for \ninfusion:\n\n3 years. \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, once reconstituted, the product must be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would \nnormally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (in a refrigerator), unless reconstitution has taken place \nin controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C. \n\nSolvent for solution for infusion:\n\nVFEND solvent for solution for infusion is a sterile, single use polypropylene infusion bag. Therefore, from \na microbiological point of view, once solvent has been removed from the bag to reconstitute the VFEND \npowder for solution for infusion and then reintroduced into the bag, the product must be used immediately. If \nnot used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless reconstitution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\nVFEND 200 mg powder for solution for infusion:\n30 ml clear Type I glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium cap with plastic seal. \n\nVFEND 200 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion:\nVFEND powder and solvent for solution for infusion is available in a box containing:\n\n1 single use 30 ml clear Type I glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium cap with plastic seal of \nVFEND 200 mg, powder for solution.\n\n1 sterile, single use, foil overwrapped, polypropylene bag containing VFEND solvent for solution for \ninfusion in one compartment (50 ml). \n\n1 sterile, single use vial adapter.\n\n1 sterile, single use syringe.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n\n\n58\n\nVFEND 200 mg powder for solution for infusion:\nThe powder is reconstituted with either 19 ml of water for injections or 19 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) Sodium \nChloride for Infusion to obtain an extractable volume of 20 ml of clear concentrate containing 10 mg/ml of \nvoriconazole. Discard the VFEND vial if vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. It is recommended \nthat a standard 20 ml (non-automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount (19.0 ml) of water for \ninjections or (9 mg/ml [0.9%]) Sodium Chloride for Infusion is dispensed. This medicinal product is for \nsingle use only and any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solutions without particles should be \nused. \n\nFor administration, the required volume of the reconstituted concentrate is added to a recommended \ncompatible infusion solution (detailed in the table below) to obtain a final voriconazole solution containing \n0.5-5 mg/ml. \n\nThe reconstituted solution can be diluted with: \n\nSodium Chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) Solution for Injection\nCompound Sodium Lactate Intravenous Infusion\n5% Glucose and Lactated Ringer’s Intravenous Infusion \n5% Glucose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Intravenous Infusion \n5% Glucose Intravenous Infusion \n5% Glucose in 20 mEq Potassium Chloride Intravenous Infusion \n0.45% Sodium Chloride Intravenous Infusion \n5% Glucose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Intravenous Infusion \n\nThe compatibility of voriconazole with diluents other than described above or in section 6.2 is \nunknown. \n\nVFEND 200 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion:\nUse only items provided in the box with VFEND powder and solvent for solution for infusion in the \npreparation of the infusion.\n\nInstructions for reconstitution and use:\n\n This medicinal product is for single use only and any unused solution should be discarded.\n To prepare the VFEND vial for reconstitution, remove the plastic cap from the vial and wipe the top \n\nwith an antiseptic swab. Hold the vial adapter over the vial and press down firmly, until the vial locks \ninto place. The spike in the vial adapter will penetrate the vial seal.\n\n Remove the bag of VFEND solvent for solution for infusion from the foil overwrap (do not use \nscissors or any other sharp tool). Snap open the blue port of the infusion bag.\n\n The VFEND powder is reconstituted by using the specially marked syringe provided to remove 19 ml \nof VFEND solvent for solution for infusion (Sodium Chloride (0.9%) from the blue port of the \ninfusion bag. \n\n The VFEND solvent for solution for infusion is then added to the vial by unscrewing the syringe from \nthe bag, connecting it to the vial adapter and then emptying the contents from the syringe into the vial. \n\n This will provide an extractable volume of 20 ml of clear concentrate containing 10 mg/ml of \nvoriconazole. The connected syringe and vial are then gently swirled to ensure that the VFEND \npowder has completely dissolved and no particulates are visible (do not shake). \n\n For dilution, gently invert the vial, vial adapter and syringe assembly and withdraw the required \nvolume of the reconstituted concentrate into the syringe (see table below). Only clear solutions \nwithout particulates should be used. Do not administer to the patient as a bolus injection.\n\n Once the syringe is reconnected to the blue port of the infusion bag, the contents are then emptied into \nthe infusion bag from the syringe to provide a final voriconazole solution containing 0.5-5 mg/ml.\n\n The syringe may then be removed and the contents of the infusion bag mixed gently by inverting the \nbag several times. The bag should be carefully inspected to ensure that there are no particulates. The \nsyringe, vial and vial adapter can then be discarded.\n\nIf the required volume of VFEND concentrate as described in the table below requires the use of multiple \n\n\n\n59\n\nvials in order to provide the appropriate dose for a given body weight, then multiple infusion kits should be \nused. The instructions should be followed for reconstitution, dilution and administration of each kit. Each kit \nis for single use only. \n\nIf multiple vials are required, each individual vial used must be administered using a separate sterile sodium \nchloride bag.\n\nFor administration, the twist-off port at the bottom of the infusion bag should be opened and the infusion line \nconnected and primed. The contents of the infusion bag are now ready for infusion to the patient. \n\nThe infusion bag should be checked to ensure that the entire contents of the bag have been infused, \nespecially if the same intravenous line is to be used for sequential infusion of other drugs. Other additives \nshould not be introduced into the infusion bag.\n\nRequired Volumes of 10 mg/ml VFEND Concentrate \n\nBody \nWeight \n\n(kg) \n\nVolume of VFEND Concentrate (10 mg/ml) required for:\n3 mg/kg dose \n(number of \n\nvials) \n\n4 mg/kg dose \n(number of \n\nvials) \n\n6 mg/kg dose \n(number of \n\nvials) \n\n8 mg/kg dose \n(number of \n\nvials) \n\n9 mg/kg dose \n(number of \n\nvials)\n10 - 4.0 ml (1) - 8.0 ml (1) 9.0 ml (1) \n15 - 6.0 ml (1) - 12.0 ml (1) 13.5 ml (1) \n20 - 8.0 ml (1) - 16.0 ml (1) 18.0 ml (1) \n25 - 10.0 ml (1) - 20.0 ml (1) 22.5 ml (2) \n30 9.0 ml (1) 12.0 ml (1) 18.0 ml (1) 24.0 ml (2) 27.0 ml (2) \n35 10.5 ml (1) 14.0 ml (1) 21.0 ml (2) 28.0 ml (2) 31.5 ml (2) \n40 12.0 ml (1) 16.0 ml (1) 24.0 ml (2) 32.0 ml (2) 36.0 ml (2) \n45 13.5 ml (1) 18.0 ml (1) 27.0 ml (2) 36.0 ml (2) 40.5 ml (3) \n50 15.0 ml (1) 20.0 ml (1) 30.0 ml (2) 40.0 ml (2) 45.0 ml (3) \n55 16.5 ml (1) 22.0 ml (2) 33.0 ml (2) 44.0 ml (3) 49.5 ml (3) \n60 18.0 ml (1) 24.0 ml (2) 36.0 ml (2) 48.0 ml (3) 54.0 ml (3) \n65 19.5 ml (1) 26.0 ml (2) 39.0 ml (2) 52.0 ml (3) 58.5 ml (3) \n70 21.0 ml (2) 28.0 ml (2) 42.0 ml (3) - -\n75 22.5 ml (2) 30.0 ml (2) 45.0 ml (3) - -\n80 24.0 ml (2) 32.0 ml (2) 48.0 ml (3) - -\n85 25.5 ml (2) 34.0 ml (2) 51.0 ml (3) - -\n90 27.0 ml (2) 36.0 ml (2) 54.0 ml (3) - -\n95 28.5 ml (2) 38.0 ml (2) 57.0 ml (3) - -\n\n100 30.0 ml (2) 40.0 ml (2) 60.0 ml (3) - -\n\nFurther information is provided for medical or healthcare professionals at the end of the Package \nLeaflet.\n\n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\nVFEND 40 mg/ml powder for oral suspension \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\nEach ml of oral suspension contains 40 mg of voriconazole when reconstituted with water. \nEach bottle contains 3 g of voriconazole. \n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach ml of suspension contains 0.54 g sucrose. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\nPowder for oral suspension\nWhite to off-white powder \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nVFEND, is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal agent and is indicated in adults and children aged 2 years \nand above as follows:\n\nTreatment of invasive aspergillosis\n\nTreatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients.\n\nTreatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei).\n\nTreatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.\n\nVFEND should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-threatening infections.\n\nProphylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) \nrecipients.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nPosology\nElectrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored \nand corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nVFEND is also available as 50 mg and 200 mg film-coated tablets, 200 mg powder for solution for injection\nand 200 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion. \n\nTreatment\nAdults\nTherapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either intravenous or oral VFEND to \nachieve plasma concentrations on Day 1 that are close to steady state. On the basis of the high oral \nbioavailability (96%; see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and oral administration is appropriate \nwhen clinically indicated. \n\n\n\n62\n\nDetailed information on dosage recommendations is provided in the following table: \n\nIntravenous Oral Suspension \n\nPatients 40 kg and\nabove*\n\nPatients less than \n40 kg*\n\nLoading dose \nregimen \n(first 24 hours) \n\n6 mg/kg every 12 \nhours \n\n400 mg (10 ml) \nevery 12 hours \n\n200 mg (5 ml) every \n12 hours \n\nMaintenance dose \n(after first 24 \nhours) \n\n4 mg/kg twice daily 200 mg (5 ml) twice\ndaily\n\n100 mg (2.5 ml) \ntwice daily\n\n* This also applies to patients aged 15 years and older\n\nDuration of treatment \nTreatment duration should be as short as possible depending on the patient’s clinical and mycological \nresponse. Long term exposure to voriconazole greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful \nassessment of the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nDosage adjustment (Adults)\nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the maintenance dose may be increased to 300 mg twice daily\nfor oral administration. For patients less than 40 kg the oral dose may be increased to 150 mg twice daily. \n\nIf patient is unable to tolerate treatment at a higher dose, reduce the oral dose by 50 mg steps to the 200 mg \ntwice daily (or 100 mg twice daily for patients less than 40 kg) maintenance dose. \n\nIn case of use as prophylaxis, refer below.\n\nChildren (2 to <12 years) and young adolescents with low body weight (12 to 14 years and <50 kg)\nVoriconazole should be dosed as children as these young adolescents may metabolize voriconazole more \nsimilarly to children than to adults.\n\nThe recommended dosing regimen is as follows:\n\nIntravenous Oral\nLoading Dose Regimen\n(first 24 hours)\n\n9 mg/kg every 12 hours Not recommended\n\nMaintenance Dose\n(after first 24 hours)\n\n8 mg/kg twice daily \n9 mg/kg twice daily \n(a maximum dose of 350 mg \ntwice daily)\n\nNote: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged \n2 to <12 years and 26 immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to <17 years. \n\nIt is recommended to initiate the therapy with intravenous regimen, and oral regimen should be considered \nonly after there is a significant clinical improvement. It should be noted that an 8 mg/kg intravenous dose \nwill provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose.\n\nThese oral dose recommendations for children are based on studies in which voriconazole was \nadministered as the powder for oral suspension. Bioequivalence between the powder for oral suspension \nand tablets has not been investigated in a paediatric population. Considering the assumed limited gastro-\nenteric transit time in paediatric patients, the absorption of tablets may be different in paediatric compared \nto adult patients. It is therefore recommended to use the oral suspension formulation in children aged 2 to \n<12. \n\nAll other adolescents (12 to 14 years and ≥50 kg; 15 to 17 years regardless of body weight)\nVoriconazole should be dosed as adults.\n\n\n\n63\n\nDosage adjustment (Children [2 to <12 years] and young adolescents with low body weight [12 to 14 years \nand <50 kg])\nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps \nif the maximum oral dose of 350 mg was used initially). If patient is unable to tolerate treatment, reduce the \ndose by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps if the maximum oral dose of 350 mg was used initially).\n\nUse in paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nProphylaxis in Adults and Children\nProphylaxis should be initiated on the day of transplant and may be administered for up to 100 days. \nProphylaxis should be as short as possible depending on the risk for developing invasive fungal infection \n(IFI) as defined by neutropenia or immunosuppression. It may only be continued up to 180 days after \ntransplantation in case of continuing immunosuppression or graft versus host disease (GvHD) (see section \n5.1). \n\nDosage \nThe recommended dosing regimen for prophylaxis is the same as for treatment in the respective age groups. \nPlease refer to the treatment tables above.\n\nDuration of prophylaxis\nThe safety and efficacy of voriconazole use for longer than 180 days has not been adequately studied in \nclinical trials.\n\nUse of voriconazole in prophylaxis for greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment of \nthe benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nThe following instructions apply to both Treatment and Prophylaxis\n\nDosage adjustment\nFor prophylaxis use, dose adjustments are not recommended in the case of lack of efficacy or treatment-\nrelated adverse events. In the case of treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation of voriconazole and \nuse of alternative antifungal agents must be considered (see section 4.4 and 4.8)\n\nDosage adjustments in case of co-administration\nPhenytoin may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased \nfrom 200 mg to 400 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), \nsee sections 4.4 and 4.5. \n\nThe combination of voriconazole with rifabutin should, if possible be avoided. However, if the combination \nis strictly needed, the maintenance dose of voriconazole may be increased from 200 mg to 350 mg orally, \ntwice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), see sections 4.4 and 4.5. \n\nEfavirenz may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased to \n400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose is reduced by 50%, i.e. to 300 mg once daily. When treatment \nwith voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of orally administered voriconazole are not affected by renal impairment. Therefore, \nno adjustment is necessary for oral dosing for patients with mild to severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. A 4-hour haemodialysis session does not \nremove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment.\n\n\n\n64\n\nHepatic impairment\nIt is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be \nhalved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) receiving voriconazole \n(see section 5.2). \n\nVoriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe chronic hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C). \n\nThere is limited data on the safety of VFEND in patients with abnormal liver function tests (aspartate \ntransaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], or total bilirubin >5 times the \nupper limit of normal).\n\nVoriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, \nsuch as jaundice, and must only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs \nthe potential risk. Patients with severe hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity (see \nsection 4.8). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of VFEND in children below 2 years has not been established. Currently available \ndata are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n\nMethod of administration\nVFEND oral suspension is to be taken at least one hour before, or two hours following, a meal.\n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCoadministration with CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine since \nincreased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare \noccurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration with rifampicin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital since these medicinal products are \nlikely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg once daily or \nhigher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole \nconcentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz \nplasma concentrations (see section 4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4).\n\nCoadministration with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg and above twice daily) because ritonavir \nsignificantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at this dose (see section \n4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4). \n\nCoadministration with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine), which are CYP3A4 substrates, \nsince increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to ergotism (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration with sirolimus since voriconazole is likely to increase plasma concentrations of \nsirolimus significantly (see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration with St. John’s Wort (see section 4.5). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nHypersensitivity\nCaution should be used in prescribing VFEND to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles (see also \nsection 4.8). \n\n\n\n65\n\nCardiovascular\nVoriconazole has been associated with QTc interval prolongation. There have been rare cases of torsades de \npointes in patients taking voriconazole who had risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, \ncardiomyopathy, hypokalaemia and concomitant medicinal products that may have been contributory. \nVoriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, \nsuch as:\n\n Congenital or acquired QTc-prolongation.\n Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present.\n Sinus bradycardia.\n Existing symptomatic arrhythmias.\n Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QTc interval. Electrolyte disturbances such \n\nas hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored and corrected, if \nnecessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.2). A study has been \nconducted in healthy volunteers which examined the effect on QTc interval of single doses of \nvoriconazole up to 4 times the usual daily dose. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the \npotentially clinically-relevant threshold of 500 msec (see section 5.1). \n\nHepatic toxicity\nIn clinical trials, there have been cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole \n(including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of \nhepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions \n(predominantly haematological malignancy). Transient hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, \nhave occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been \nreversible on discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.8). \n\nMonitoring of hepatic function\nPatients receiving VFEND must be carefully monitored for hepatic toxicity. Clinical management should \ninclude laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (specifically AST and ALT) at the initiation of treatment \nwith VFEND and at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Treatment duration should be as short as \npossible; however, if based on the benefit-risk assessment the treatment is continued (see section 4.2), \nmonitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly if there are no changes in the liver function tests. \n\nIf the liver function tests become markedly elevated, VFEND should be discontinued, unless the medical \njudgment of the risk-benefit of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use. \n\nMonitoring of hepatic function should be carried out in both children and adults.\n\nSerious dermatological adverse reactions\n\n Phototoxicity\nIn addition VFEND has been associated with phototoxicity including reactions such as ephelides, \nlentigo, actinic keratosis and pseudoporphyria. It is recommended that all patients, including \nchildren, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment and use measures such as \nprotective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF).\n\n Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC)\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin has been reported in patients, some of whom have reported \nprior phototoxic reactions. If phototoxic reactions occur multidisciplinary advice should be sought,\nVFEND discontinuation and use of alternative antifungal agents should be considered and the \npatient should be referred to a dermatologist. If VFEND is continued, however, dermatologic \nevaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis, to allow early detection and \nmanagement of premalignant lesions. VFEND should be discontinued if premalignant skin lesions or \nsquamous cell carcinoma are identified (see below the section under Long-term treatment).\n\n\n\n66\n\n Exfoliative cutaneous reactions\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS),\nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported with the use of voriconazole. If a patient \ndevelops a rash he should be monitored closely and VFEND discontinued if lesions progress.\n\nLong-term treatment\nLong term exposure (treatment or prophylaxis) greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful \nassessment of the benefit-risk balance and physicians should therefore consider the need to limit the \nexposure to VFEND (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) has been reported in relation with long-term VFEND \ntreatment.\n\nNon-infectious periostitis with elevated fluoride and alkaline phosphatase levels has been reported in \ntransplant patients. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with \nperiostitis VFEND discontinuation should be considered after multidisciplinary advice.\n\nVisual adverse reactions\nThere have been reports of prolonged visual adverse reactions, including blurred vision, optic neuritis and \npapilloedema (see section 4.8).\n\nRenal adverse reactions\nAcute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. \nPatients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nMonitoring of renal function\nPatients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include \nlaboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. \n\nMonitoring of pancreatic function\nPatients, especially children, with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]), should be monitored closely during VFEND treatment. \nMonitoring of serum amylase or lipase may be considered in this clinical situation. \n\nPaediatric population\nSafety and effectiveness in paediatric subjects below the age of two years has not been established (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). Voriconazole is indicated for paediatric patients aged two years or older. A higher \nfrequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the paediatric population (see section 4.8). Hepatic \nfunction should be monitored in both children and adults. Oral bioavailability may be limited in paediatric \npatients aged 2 to <12 years with malabsorption and very low body weight for age. In that case, intravenous \nvoriconazole administration is recommended. \n\n Serious dermatological adverse reactions (including SCC)\nThe frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the paediatric population. As an evolution \ntowards SCC has been reported, stringent measures for the photoprotection are warranted in this \npopulation of patients. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, \nsun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation.\n\nProphylaxis\nIn case of treatment-related adverse events (hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions including phototoxicity and \nSCC, severe or prolonged visual disorders and periostitis), discontinuation of voriconazole and use of \nalternative antifungal agents must be considered.\n\nPhenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate and potent CYP450 inducer)\nCareful monitoring of phenytoin levels is recommended when phenytoin is coadministered with \n\n\n\n67\n\nvoriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and phenytoin should be avoided unless the benefit \noutweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n\nEfavirenz (CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate)\nWhen voriconazole is coadministered with efavirenz the dose of voriconazole should be increased to 400 mg \nevery 12 hours and the dose of efavirenz should be decreased to 300 mg every 24 hours (see sections 4.2, 4.3\nand 4.5).\n\nRifabutin (Potent CYP450 inducer)\nCareful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions to rifabutin (e.g., uveitis) is recommended \nwhen rifabutin is coadministered with voriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and rifabutin should \nbe avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n\nRitonavir (potent CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate)\nCoadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided unless an \nassessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\nEverolimus (CYP3A4 substrate, P-gp substrate)\nCoadministration of voriconazole with everolimus is not recommended because voriconazole is expected \nto significantly increase everolimus concentrations. Currently there are insufficient data to allow dosing \nrecommendations in this situation (see section 4.5).\n\nMethadone (CYP3A4 substrate)\nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to methadone, including QTc \nprolongation, is recommended when coadministered with voriconazole since methadone levels increased \nfollowing coadministration of voriconazole. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed (see section \n4.5). \n\nShort-acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate)\nReduction in the dose of alfentanil, fentanyl and other short-acting opiates similar in structure to alfentanil \nand metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with \nvoriconazole (see section 4.5). As the half-life of alfentanil is prolonged in a 4-fold manner when alfentanil \nis coadministered with voriconazole, and in an independent published study concomitant use of \nvoriconazole with fentanyl resulted in an increase in the mean AUC0-∞ of fentanyl, frequent monitoring for \nopiate-associated adverse reactions (including a longer respiratory monitoring period) may be necessary. \n\nLong-acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate)\nReduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., \nhydrocodone) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Frequent monitoring for opiate-\nassociated adverse reactions may be necessary (see section 4.5).\n\nFluconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor)\nCoadministration of oral voriconazole and oral fluconazole resulted in a significant increase in Cmax and \nAUCτ of voriconazole in healthy subjects. The reduced dose and/or frequency of voriconazole and \nfluconazole that would eliminate this effect have not been established. Monitoring for voriconazole-\nassociated adverse reactions is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nVFEND oral suspension contains sucrose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of fructose intolerance, sucrase-isomaltase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nVoriconazole is metabolised by, and inhibits the activity of, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, \nCYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these isoenzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole \nplasma concentrations, respectively, and there is potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma \nconcentrations of substances metabolised by these CYP450 isoenzymes.  \nUnless otherwise specified, drug interaction studies have been performed in healthy adult male subjects \n\n\n\n68\n\nusing multiple dosing to steady state with oral voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily (BID). These results are \nrelevant to other populations and routes of administration. \n\nVoriconazole should be administered with caution in patients with concomitant medication that is known \nto prolong QTc interval. When there is also a potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma \nconcentrations of substances metabolised by CYP3A4 isoenzymes (certain antihistamines, quinidine, \ncisapride, pimozide), coadministration is contraindicated (see below and section 4.3).\n\nInteraction table\nInteractions between voriconazole and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (once daily \nas “QD”, twice daily as “BID”, three times daily as “TID” and not determined as “ND”). The direction of \nthe arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric \nmean ratio being within (↔), below (↓) or above (↑) the 80-125% range. The asterisk (*) indicates a two-\nway interaction. AUC, AUCt and AUC0- represent area under the curve over a dosing interval, from time \nzero to the time with detectable measurement and from time zero to infinity, respectively.\n\nThe interactions in the table are presented in the following order: contraindications, those requiring dose \nadjustment and careful clinical and/or biological monitoring, and finally those that have no significant \npharmacokinetic interaction but may be of clinical interest in this therapeutic field.\n\nMedicinal product\n[Mechanism of interaction]\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean changes (%)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning\ncoadministration\n\nAstemizole, cisapride, \npimozide, quinidine and \nterfenadine\n[CYP3A4 substrates]\n\nAlthough not studied, increased \nplasma concentrations of these \nmedicinal products can lead to QTc \nprolongation and rare occurrences \nof torsades de pointes.\n\nContraindicated (see section \n4.3)\n\nCarbamazepine and long-acting \nbarbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital, \nmephobarbital) \n[potent CYP450 inducers]\n\nAlthough not studied, \ncarbamazepine and long-acting \nbarbiturates are likely to \nsignificantly decrease plasma \nvoriconazole concentrations.\n\nContraindicated (see section \n4.3)\n\nEfavirenz (a non-nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor) \n[CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 \ninhibitor and substrate]\n\nEfavirenz 400 mg QD,\ncoadministered with \nvoriconazole 200 mg BID*\n\nEfavirenz 300 mg QD, \ncoadministered with \nvoriconazole 400 mg BID*\n\nEfavirenz Cmax  38%\nEfavirenz AUC  44%\nVoriconazole Cmax  61%\nVoriconazole AUC  77%\n\nCompared to efavirenz 600 mg QD,\nEfavirenz Cmax ↔\nEfavirenz AUC  17%\n\nCompared to voriconazole 200 mg \nBID,\nVoriconazole Cmax  23%\nVoriconazole AUC  7%\n\nUse of standard doses of \nvoriconazole with efavirenz \ndoses of 400 mg QD or higher\nis contraindicated (see\nsection 4.3).  \n\nVoriconazole may be \ncoadministered with efavirenz \nif the voriconazole \nmaintenance dose is increased \nto 400 mg BID and the \nefavirenz dose is decreased to \n300 mg QD.

The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n\n\n\n74\n\nVFEND must not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the \npotential risk to the foetus. \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential \nWomen of child-bearing potential must always use effective contraception during treatment. \n\nBreast-feeding\nThe excretion of voriconazole into breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on \ninitiation of treatment with VFEND. \n\nFertility\nIn an animal study, no impairment of fertility was demonstrated in male and female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nVFEND has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It may cause transient and \nreversible changes to vision, including blurring, altered/enhanced visual perception and/or photophobia. \nPatients must avoid potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving or operating machinery while \nexperiencing these symptoms. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of safety profile\nThe safety profile of voriconazole in adults is based on an integrated safety database of more than 2,000 \nsubjects (including 1,603 adult patients in therapeutic trials) and an additional 270 adults in prophylaxis \ntrials. This represents a heterogeneous population, containing patients with haematological malignancy, \nHIV-infected patients with oesophageal candidiasis and refractory fungal infections, non-neutropenic \npatients with candidaemia or aspergillosis and healthy volunteers. \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions were visual impairment, pyrexia, rash, vomiting, nausea, \ndiarrhoea, headache, peripheral oedema, liver function test abnormal, respiratory distress and abdominal \npain.\n\nThe severity of the adverse reactions was generally mild to moderate. No clinically significant differences \nwere seen when the safety data were analysed by age, race, or gender. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nIn the table below, since the majority of the studies were of an open nature, all causality adverse reactions\nand their frequency categories in 1,873 adults from pooled therapeutic (1,603) and prophylaxis (270) studies, \nby system organ class, are listed.\n\nFrequency categories are expressed as: Very common (1/10); Common (1/100 to 1/10); Uncommon \n(1/1,000 to 1/100); Rare (1/10,000 to 1/1,000); Very rare (1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\nUndesirable effects reported in subjects receiving voriconazole: \n\n\n\n75\n\nSystem \nOrgan Class\n\nVery common\n≥ 1/10\n\nCommon\n≥ 1/100\n\nto < 1/10\n\nUncommon\n≥ 1/1,000 to <\n\n1/100\n\nRare\n≥ 1/10,000 to <\n\n1/1,000\n\nFrequency\nnot known\n(cannot be\nestimated\n\nfrom\navailable\n\ndata)\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nsinusitis pseudomembranous \ncolitis\n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including \ncysts and \npolyps)\n\nsquamous \ncell \ncarcinoma*\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nagranulocytosis1, \npancytopenia, \nthrombocytopenia2, \nleukopenia, \nanaemia\n\nbone marrow \nfailure, \nlymphadenopathy, \neosinophilia\n\ndisseminated \nintravascular \ncoagulation\n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nhypersensitivity anaphylactoid \nreaction\n\nEndocrine \ndisorders\n\nadrenal \ninsufficiency, \nhypothyroidism\n\nhyperthyroidism\n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders\n\noedema \nperipheral\n\nhypoglycaemia, \nhypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\ndepression, \nhallucination, \nanxiety, insomnia, \nagitation, \nconfusional state\n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nheadache convulsion, \nsyncope, tremor, \nhypertonia3, \nparaesthesia, \nsomnolence, \ndizziness\n\nbrain oedema, \nencephalopathy4, \nextrapyramidal \ndisorder5, \nneuropathy \nperipheral, ataxia, \nhypoaesthesia, \ndysgeusia\n\nhepatic \nencephalopathy, \nGuillain-Barre \nsyndrome, \nnystagmus\n\nEye disorders visual \nimpairment6\n\nretinal \nhaemorrhage\n\noptic nerve \ndisorder7, \npapilloedema8, \noculogyric crisis, \ndiplopia, scleritis, \nblepharitis\n\noptic atrophy, \ncorneal opacity\n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\nhypoacusis, \nvertigo, tinnitus\n\n\n\n76\n\nSystem \nOrgan Class\n\nVery common\n≥ 1/10\n\nCommon\n≥ 1/100\n\nto < 1/10\n\nUncommon\n≥ 1/1,000 to <\n\n1/100\n\nRare\n≥ 1/10,000 to <\n\n1/1,000\n\nFrequency\nnot known\n(cannot be\nestimated\n\nfrom\navailable\n\ndata)\n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\narrhythmia \nsupraventricular, \ntachycardia, \nbradycardia\n\nventricular \nfibrillation, \nventricular \nextrasystoles, \nventricular \ntachycardia, \nelectrocardiogram \nQT prolonged, \nsupraventricular \ntachycardia\n\ntorsades de \npointes, \natrioventricular \nblock complete, \nbundle branch \nblock, nodal \nrhythm\n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nhypotension, \nphlebitis\n\nthrombophlebitis, \nlymphangitis\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nrespiratory \ndistress9\n\nacute respiratory \ndistress syndrome, \npulmonary oedema\n\nGastrointestin\nal disorders \n\ndiarrhoea, \nvomiting, \nabdominal \npain, nausea\n\ncheilitis, dyspepsia, \nconstipation, \ngingivitis\n\nperitonitis, \npancreatitis, \nswollen tongue, \nduodenitis, \ngastroenteritis, \nglossitis\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nliver function \ntest abnormal\n\njaundice, jaundice \ncholestatic, \nhepatitis10\n\nhepatic failure, \nhepatomegaly, \ncholecystitis, \ncholelithiasis\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\nrash dermatitis \nexfoliative, \nalopecia, rash \nmaculo-papular, \npruritus, erythema\n\nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome8, \nphototoxicity, \npurpura, urticaria, \ndermatitis allergic, \nrash papular, rash \nmacular, eczema\n\ntoxic epidermal \nnecrolysis8, drug \nreaction with \neosinophilia and \nsystemic \nsymptoms \n(DRESS)8, \n\nangioedema, \nactinic \nkeratosis*, \npseudoporphyria\n, erythema \nmultiforme, \npsoriasis, drug \neruption\n\ncutaneous \nlupus \nerythemato\nsus*, \nephelides*, \nlentigo*\n\nMusculoskelet\nal and \nconnective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\nback pain arthritis periostitis*\n\n\n\n77\n\nSystem \nOrgan Class\n\nVery common\n≥ 1/10\n\nCommon\n≥ 1/100\n\nto < 1/10\n\nUncommon\n≥ 1/1,000 to <\n\n1/100\n\nRare\n≥ 1/10,000 to <\n\n1/1,000\n\nFrequency\nnot known\n(cannot be\nestimated\n\nfrom\navailable\n\ndata)\n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\nrenal failure acute, \nhaematuria\n\nrenal tubular \nnecrosis, \nproteinuria, \nnephritis\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\npyrexia chest pain, face \noedema11, asthenia, \nchills\n\ninfusion site \nreaction, influenza \nlike illness\n\nInvestigations blood creatinine \nincreased\n\nblood urea \nincreased, blood \ncholesterol \nincreased\n\n*ADR identified post-marketing\n1 Includes febrile neutropenia and neutropenia.\n2 Includes immune thrombocytopenic purpura.\n3 Includes nuchal rigidity and tetany.\n4 Includes hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy and metabolic encephalopathy.\n5 Includes akathisia and parkinsonism.\n6 See “Visual impairments” paragraph in section 4.8.\n7 Prolonged optic neuritis has been reported post-marketing.

These visual impairments were transient and fully reversible, with the \nmajority spontaneously resolving within 60 minutes and no clinically significant long-term visual effects \nwere observed. There was evidence of attenuation with repeated doses of voriconazole. The visual \nimpairments were generally mild, rarely resulted in discontinuation and were not associated with long-term \nsequelae. Visual impairments may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses.\n\nThe mechanism of action is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a \nstudy in healthy volunteers investigating the impact of voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused \na decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude. The ERG measures electrical currents in the \nretina. The ERG changes did not progress over 29 days of treatment and were fully reversible on withdrawal \nof voriconazole. \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events (see section 4.4).\n\nDermatological reactions \nDermatological reactions were very common in patients treated with voriconazole in clinical trials, but these \n\n\n\n78\n\npatients had serious underlying diseases and were receiving multiple concomitant medicinal products. The \nmajority of rashes were of mild to moderate severity. Patients have developed severe cutaneous adverse \nreactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (uncommon), toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN) (rare), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (rare) and erythema \nmultiforme (rare) during treatment with VFEND (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a patient develops a rash they should be monitored closely and VFEND discontinued if lesions progress. \nPhotosensitivity reactions such as ephelides, lentigo and actinic keratosis have been reported, especially \nduring long-term therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nThere have been reports of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in patients treated with VFEND for long \nperiods of time; the mechanism has not been established (see section 4.4).\n\nLiver function tests \nThe overall incidence of transaminase increases >3 xULN (not necessarily comprising an adverse event) in \nthe voriconazole clinical programme was 18.0% (319/1,768) in adults and 25.8% (73/283) in paediatric\nsubjects who received voriconazole for pooled therapeutic and prophylaxis use. Liver function test \nabnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal \nliver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, \nincluding discontinuation of therapy. \n\nVoriconazole has been associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity in patients with other serious \nunderlying conditions. This includes cases of jaundice, hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nProphylaxis\nIn an open-label, comparative, multicenter study comparing voriconazole and itraconazole as primary \nprophylaxis in adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI, \npermanent discontinuation of voriconazole due to AEs was reported in 39.3% of subjects versus 39.6% of \nsubjects in the itraconazole arm. Treatment-emergent hepatic AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of \nstudy medication for 50 subjects (21.4%) treated with voriconazole and for 18 subjects (7.1%) treated with \nitraconazole. \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety of voriconazole was investigated in 288 paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years (169) and 12 to \n<18 years (119) who received voriconazole for prophylaxis (183) and therapeutic use (105) in clinical trials. \nThe safety of voriconazole was also investigated in 158 additional paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in \ncompassionate use programs. Overall, the safety profile of voriconazole in paediatric population was similar \nto that in adults. However, a trend towards a higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations, reported as \nadverse events in clinical trials was observed in paediatric patients as compared to adults (14.2% \ntransaminases increased in paediatrics compared to 5.3% in adults). Post-marketing data suggest there might\nbe a higher occurrence of skin reactions (especially erythema) in the paediatric population compared to \nadults. In the 22 patients less than 2 years old who received voriconazole in a compassionate use programme, \nthe following adverse reactions (for which a relationship to voriconazole could not be excluded) were \nreported: photosensitivity reaction (1), arrhythmia (1), pancreatitis (1), blood bilirubin increased (1), hepatic \nenzymes increased (1), rash (1) and papilloedema (1). There have been post-marketing reports of pancreatitis \nin paediatric patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nIn clinical trials there were 3 cases of accidental overdose. All occurred in paediatric patients, who \nreceived up to five times the recommended intravenous dose of voriconazole. A single adverse reaction of \nphotophobia of 10 minutes duration was reported. \n\n\n\n79\n\nThere is no known antidote to voriconazole.\n\nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. In an overdose, haemodialysis may assist in \nthe removal of voriconazole from the body.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02A \nC03\n\nMode of Action\nVoriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. The primary mode of action of voriconazole is the inhibition of \nfungal cytochrome P450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylation, an essential step in fungal ergosterol \nbiosynthesis. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol \nin the fungal cell membrane and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of voriconazole. Voriconazole \nhas been shown to be more selective for fungal cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for various mammalian \ncytochrome P-450 enzyme systems.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic Relationship\nIn 10 therapeutic studies, the median for the average and maximum plasma concentrations in individual \nsubjects across the studies was 2425 ng/ml (inter-quartile range 1193 to 4380 ng/ml) and 3742 ng/ml (inter-\nquartile range 2027 to 6302 ng/ml), respectively. A positive association between mean, maximum or \nminimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy in therapeutic studies was not found and this \nrelationship has not been explored in prophylaxis studies. \n\nPharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic analyses of clinical trial data identified positive associations \nbetween plasma voriconazole concentrations and both liver function test abnormalities and visual \ndisturbances. Dose adjustments in prophylaxis studies have not been explored.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn vitro, voriconazole displays broad-spectrum antifungal activity with antifungal potency against \nCandida species (including fluconazole-resistant C. krusei and resistant strains of C. glabrata and \nC. albicans) and fungicidal activity against all Aspergillus species tested. In addition voriconazole shows in \nvitro fungicidal activity against emerging fungal pathogens, including those such as Scedosporium or \nFusarium which have limited susceptibility to existing antifungal agents.\n\nClinical efficacy defined as partial or complete response, has been demonstrated for Aspergillus spp. \nincluding A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. niger, A. nidulans; Candida spp., including C. albicans, \nC. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis; and limited numbers of C. dubliniensis, \nC. inconspicua, and C. guilliermondii, Scedosporium spp., including S. apiospermum, S. prolificans; and \nFusarium spp. \n\nOther treated fungal infections (often with either partial or complete response) included isolated cases of \nAlternaria spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Blastoschizomyces capitatus, Cladosporium spp.,\nCoccidioides immitis, Conidiobolus coronatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Exserohilum rostratum,\nExophiala spinifera, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Madurella mycetomatis, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Penicillium spp. \nincluding P. marneffei, Phialophora richardsiae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Trichosporon spp. \nincluding T. beigelii infections.\n\nIn vitro activity against clinical isolates has been observed for Acremonium spp., Alternaria spp., \nBipolaris spp., Cladophialophora spp., and Histoplasma capsulatum, with most strains being inhibited by \nconcentrations of voriconazole in the range 0.05 to 2 µg/ml.\n\nIn vitro activity against the following pathogens has been shown, but the clinical significance is \n\n\n\n80\n\nunknown: Curvularia spp. and Sporothrix spp. \n\nBreakpoints\nSpecimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be \nobtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the \nresults of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become \navailable, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. \n\nThe species most frequently involved in causing human infections include C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, \nC. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei, all of which usually exhibit minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs)\nof less than 1 mg/L for voriconazole.  \n\nHowever, the in vitro activity of voriconazole against Candida species is not uniform. Specifically, for \nC. glabrata, the MICs of voriconazole for fluconazole-resistant isolates are proportionally higher than are \nthose of fluconazole-susceptible isolates. Therefore, every attempt should be made to identify Candida to \nspecies level. If antifungal susceptibility testing is available, the MIC results may be interpreted using \nbreakpoint criteria established by European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).\n\nEUCAST Breakpoints\n\nCandida species MIC breakpoint (mg/L)\n≤S (Susceptible) >R (Resistant)\n\nCandida albicans1 0.125 0.125\nCandida tropicalis1 0.125 0.125\nCandida parapsilosis1 0.125 0.125\nCandida glabrata2 Insufficient evidence\nCandida krusei3 Insufficient evidence\nOther Candida spp.4 Insufficient evidence\n1 Strains with MIC values above the Susceptible (S) breakpoint are rare, or \nnot yet reported. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests \non any such isolate must be repeated and if the result is confirmed the \nisolate sent to a reference laboratory. \n2 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in patients with C. glabrata\ninfections was 21% lower compared to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. \ntropicalis. In vitro data showed a slight increase of resistance of C. \nglabrata to voriconazole.\n3 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in C. krusei infections was \nsimilar to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. However, as there \nwere only 9 cases available for EUCAST analysis, there is currently \ninsufficient evidence to set clinical breakpoints for C. krusei. \n4 EUCAST has not determined non-species related breakpoints for \nvoriconazole.\n\nClinical experience \nSuccessful outcome in this section is defined as complete or partial response. \n\nAspergillus infections – efficacy in aspergillosis patients with poor prognosis \nVoriconazole has in vitro fungicidal activity against Aspergillus spp. The efficacy and survival benefit of \nvoriconazole versus conventional amphotericin B in the primary treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis \nwas demonstrated in an open, randomised, multicentre study in 277 immunocompromised patients treated \nfor 12 weeks. Voriconazole was administered intravenously with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours \nfor the first 24 hours followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours for a minimum of 7 days. \nTherapy could then be switched to the oral formulation at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours. Median duration \nof IV voriconazole therapy was 10 days (range 2-85 days). After IV voriconazole therapy, the median \nduration of oral voriconazole therapy was 76 days (range 2-232 days).\n\nA satisfactory global response (complete or partial resolution of all attributable symptoms, signs, \n\n\n\n81\n\nradiographic/bronchoscopic abnormalities present at baseline) was seen in 53% of voriconazole-treated \npatients compared to 31% of patients treated with comparator. The 84-day survival rate for voriconazole was \nstatistically significantly higher than that for the comparator and a clinically and statistically significant \nbenefit was shown in favour of voriconazole for both time to death and time to discontinuation due to \ntoxicity. \n\nThis study confirmed findings from an earlier, prospectively designed study where there was a positive \noutcome in subjects with risk factors for a poor prognosis, including graft versus host disease, and, in \nparticular, cerebral infections (normally associated with almost 100% mortality). \n\nThe studies included cerebral, sinus, pulmonary and disseminated aspergillosis in patients with bone \nmarrow and solid organ transplants, haematological malignancies, cancer and AIDS. \n\nCandidaemia in non-neutropenic patients \nThe efficacy of voriconazole compared to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in the \nprimary treatment of candidaemia was demonstrated in an open, comparative study. Three hundred and \nseventy non-neutropenic patients (above 12 years of age) with documented candidaemia were included in the \nstudy, of whom 248 were treated with voriconazole. Nine subjects in the voriconazole group and 5 in the \namphotericin B followed by fluconazole group also had mycologically proven infection in deep tissue. \nPatients with renal failure were excluded from this study. The median treatment duration was 15 days in both \ntreatment arms. In the primary analysis, successful response as assessed by a Data Review Committee \n(DRC) blinded to study medicinal product was defined as resolution/improvement in all clinical signs and \nsymptoms of infection with eradication of Candida from blood and infected deep tissue sites 12 weeks after \nthe end of therapy (EOT). Patients who did not have an assessment 12 weeks after EOT were counted as \nfailures. In this analysis a successful response was seen in 41% of patients in both treatment arms. \n\nIn a secondary analysis, which utilised DRC assessments at the latest evaluable time point (EOT, or 2, 6, or \n12 weeks after EOT) voriconazole and the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole had \nsuccessful response rates of 65% and 71%, respectively. \n\nThe Investigator’s assessment of successful outcome at each of these time points is shown in the following \ntable.\n\nTimepoint Voriconazole \n(N=248)  \n\nAmphotericin B \n→ fluconazole \n(N=122)\n\nEOT 178 (72%) 88 (72%) \n\n2 weeks after \nEOT \n\n125 (50%) 62 (51%)\n\n6 weeks after \nEOT \n\n104 (42%) 55 (45%)\n\n12 weeks after \nEOT \n\n104 (42%) 51 (42%)\n\nSerious refractory Candida infections \nThe study comprised 55 patients with serious refractory systemic Candida infections (including \ncandidaemia, disseminated and other invasive candidiasis) where prior antifungal treatment, particularly with \nfluconazole, had been ineffective. Successful response was seen in 24 patients (15 complete, 9 partial \nresponses). In fluconazole-resistant non-albicans species, a successful outcome was seen in 3/3 C. krusei\n(complete responses) and 6/8 C. glabrata (5 complete, 1 partial response) infections. The clinical efficacy \ndata were supported by limited susceptibility data. \n\nScedosporium and Fusarium infections\nVoriconazole was shown to be effective against the following rare fungal pathogens:\n\nScedosporium spp.: Successful response to voriconazole therapy was seen in 16 (6 complete, 10 partial\n\n\n\n82\n\nresponses) of 28 patients with S. apiospermum and in 2 (both partial responses) of 7 patients with \nS. prolificans infection. In addition, a successful response was seen in 1 of 3 patients with infections \ncaused by more than one organism including Scedosporium spp. \n\nFusarium spp.: Seven (3 complete, 4 partial responses) of 17 patients were successfully treated with \nvoriconazole. Of these 7 patients, 3 had eye, 1 had sinus, and 3 had disseminated infection. Four additional \npatients with fusariosis had an infection caused by several organisms; 2 of them had a successful outcome. \n\nThe majority of patients receiving voriconazole treatment of the above mentioned rare infections were \nintolerant of, or refractory to, prior antifungal therapy. \n\nPrimary Prophylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections – Efficacy in HSCT recipients without prior proven or \nprobable IFI\nVoriconazole was compared to itraconazole as primary prophylaxis in an open-label, comparative, \nmulticenter study of adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI. \nSuccess was defined as the ability to continue study drug prophylaxis for 100 days after HSCT (without \nstopping for >14 days) and survival with no proven or probable IFI for 180 days after HSCT. The modified \nintent-to-treat (MITT) group included 465 allogeneic HSCT recipients with 45% of patients having AML. \nFrom all patients 58% were subject to myeloablative conditions regimens. Prophylaxis with study drug was \nstarted immediately after HSCT: 224 received voriconazole and 241 received itraconazole. The median \nduration of study drug prophylaxis was 96 days for voriconazole and 68 days for itraconazole in the MITT \ngroup.\n\nSuccess rates and other secondary endpoints are presented in the table below:\n\nStudy Endpoints Voriconazole\nN=224\n\nItraconazole\nN=241\n\nDifference in \nproportions and the \n\n95% confidence interval \n(CI) \n\nP-Value\n\nSuccess at day 180* 109 (48.7%) 80 (33.2%) 16.4% (7.7%, 25.1%)** 0.0002**\nSuccess at day 100 121 (54.0%) 96 (39.8%) 15.4% (6.6%, 24.2%)** 0.0006**\nCompleted at least 100 days of \nstudy drug prophylaxis \n\n120 (53.6%) 94 (39.0%) 14.6% (5.6%, 23.5%) 0.0015\n\nSurvived to day 180 184 (82.1%) 197 (81.7%) 0.4% (-6.6%, 7.4%) 0.9107\nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI to day 180\n\n3 (1.3%) 5 (2.1%) -0.7% (-3.1%, 1.6%) 0.5390\n\nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI to day 100\n\n2 (0.9%) 4 (1.7%) -0.8% (-2.8%, 1.3%) 0.4589\n\nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI while on study drug\n\n0 3 (1.2%) -1.2% (-2.6%, 0.2%) 0.0813\n\n* Primary endpoint of the study\n** Difference in proportions, 95% CI and p-values obtained after adjustment for randomization\n\nThe breakthrough IFI rate to Day 180 and the primary endpoint of the study, which is Success at Day 180, \nfor patients with AML and myeloablative conditioning regimens respectively, is presented in the table \nbelow:\n\nAML\n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazole \n(N=98) \n\nItraconazole\n(N=109)\n\nDifference in proportions \nand the 95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI)\nBreakthrough IFI – Day 180 1 (1.0%) 2 (1.8%) -0.8% (-4.0%, 2.4%) **\n\nSuccess at Day 180* 55 (56.1%) 45 (41.3%) 14.7% (1.7%, 27.7%)***\n\n\n\n83\n\n*   Primary endpoint of study\n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated \n***Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization\n\nMyeloablative conditioning regimens\n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazole \n(N=125) \n\nItraconazole\n(N=143)\n\nDifference in proportions \nand the 95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI)\nBreakthrough IFI – Day 180 2 (1.6%) 3 (2.1%) -0.5% (-3.7%, 2.7%) **\n\nSuccess at Day 180* 70 (56.0%) 53 (37.1%) 20.1% (8.5%, 31.7%)***\n\n*   Primary endpoint of study\n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated \n*** Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization \n\nSecondary Prophylaxis of IFI – Efficacy in HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI\nVoriconazole was investigated as secondary prophylaxis in an open-label, non-comparative, multicenter \nstudy of adult allogeneic HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI. The primary endpoint was the \nrate of occurrence of proven and probable IFI during the first year after HSCT. The MITT group included 40 \npatients with prior IFI, including 31 with aspergillosis, 5 with candidiasis, and 4 with other IFI. The median \nduration of study drug prophylaxis was 95.5 days in the MITT group.\n\nProven or probable IFIs developed in 7.5% (3/40) of patients during the first year after HSCT, including one \ncandidemia, one scedosporiosis (both relapses of prior IFI), and one zygomycosis. The survival rate at Day \n180 was 80.0% (32/40) and at 1 year was 70.0% (28/40).\n\nDuration of treatment \nIn clinical trials, 705 patients received voriconazole therapy for greater than 12 weeks, with 164 patients \nreceiving voriconazole for over 6 months. \n\nPaediatric population\nFifty-three paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years were treated with voriconazole in two prospective, open-\nlabel, non-comparative, multi-center clinical trials. One study enrolled 31 patients with possible, proven or \nprobable invasive aspergillosis (IA), of whom 14 patients had proven or probable IA and were included in \nthe MITT efficacy analyses. The second study enrolled 22 patients with invasive candidiasis including \ncandidaemia (ICC), and esophageal candidiasis (EC) requiring either primary or salvage therapy, of whom \n17 were included in the MITT efficacy analyses. For patients with IA the overall rates of global response at 6 \nweeks were 64.3% (9/14), the global response rate was 40% (2/5) for patients 2 to <12 years and 77.8% (7/9) \nfor patients 12 to <18 years of age. For patients with ICC the global response rate at EOT was 85.7% (6/7) \nand for patients with EC the global response rate at EOT was 70% (7/10). The overall rate of response (ICC \nand EC combined) was 88.9% (8/9) for 2 to <12 years old and 62.5% (5/8) for 12 to <18 years old.  \n\nClinical studies examining QTc interval \nA placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QTc interval of \nhealthy volunteers was conducted with three oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. The placebo-\nadjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1200 and 1600 mg of voriconazole were \n5.1, 4.8, and 8.2 msec, respectively and 7.0 msec for ketoconazole 800 mg. No subject in any group had an \nincrease in QTc of ≥ 60 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially \nclinically-relevant threshold of 500 msec.  \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nGeneral pharmacokinetic characteristics \nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterised in healthy subjects, special populations and \npatients. During oral administration of 200 mg or 300 mg twice daily for 14 days in patients at risk of \naspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or haematopoietic tissue), the observed \n\n\n\n84\n\npharmacokinetic characteristics of rapid and consistent absorption, accumulation and non-linear \npharmacokinetics were in agreement with those observed in healthy subjects. \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. Greater than \nproportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, \nincreasing the oral dose from 200 mg twice daily to 300 mg twice daily leads to a 2.5-fold increase in \nexposure (AUCτ). The oral maintenance dose of 200 mg (or 100 mg for patients less than 40 kg) achieves a \nvoriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg IV. A 300 mg (or 150 mg for patients less than 40 kg) oral \nmaintenance dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg IV. When the recommended intravenous or oral \nloading dose regimens are administered, plasma concentrations close to steady state are achieved within the \nfirst 24 hours of dosing. Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during twice daily multiple dosing \nwith steady-state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by Day 6 in the majority of subjects. \n\nAbsorption \nVoriconazole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, with maximum \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved 1-2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of voriconazole \nafter oral administration is estimated to be 96%. Bioequivalence was established between the 200 mg tablet \nand the 40 mg/ml oral suspension when administered as a 200 mg dose. When multiple doses of \nvoriconazole oral suspension are administered with high fat meals, Cmax and AUCτ are reduced by 58% and \n37% respectively. The absorption of voriconazole is not affected by changes in gastric pH. \n\nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive \ndistribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58%. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from \neight patients in a compassionate programme showed detectable voriconazole concentrations in all patients. \n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \nCYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.\n\nThe inter-individual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. \n\nIn vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This \nenzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism. For example, 15-20% of Asian populations may be expected to be \npoor metabolisers. For Caucasians and Blacks the prevalence of poor metabolisers is 3-5%. Studies \nconducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolisers have, on average, \n4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUCτ) than their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts. \nSubjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolisers have on average 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure \nthan their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts. \n\nThe major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating \nradiolabelled metabolites in plasma. This metabolite has minimal antifungal activity and does not \ncontribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole.\n\nElimination \nVoriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged in \nthe urine.  \n\nAfter administration of a radiolabelled dose of voriconazole, approximately 80% of the radioactivity is \nrecovered in the urine after multiple intravenous dosing and 83% in the urine after multiple oral dosing. The \nmajority (>94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous \ndosing. \n\nThe terminal half-life of voriconazole depends on dose and is approximately 6 hours at 200 mg (orally). \nBecause of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life is not useful in the prediction of the \naccumulation or elimination of voriconazole. \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n\n\n\n85\n\nGender \nIn an oral multiple-dose study, Cmax and AUCτ for healthy young females were 83% and 113% higher, \nrespectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). In the same study, no significant differences in Cmax\nand AUCτ were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (≥65 years). \n\nIn the clinical programme, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of gender. The safety profile and \nplasma concentrations observed in male and female patients were similar. Therefore, no dosage adjustment \nbased on gender is necessary. \n\nElderly\nIn an oral multiple-dose study Cmax and AUCτ in healthy elderly males (≥65 years) were 61% and 86% \nhigher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). No significant differences in Cmax and AUCτ \nwere observed between healthy elderly females (≥65 years) and healthy young females (18-45 years). \n\nIn the therapeutic studies no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. A relationship between plasma \nconcentrations and age was observed.The safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly patients was \nsimilar and, therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 4.2). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe recommended doses in children and adolescent patients are based on a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis of data obtained from 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years and 26 \nimmunocompromised adolescent patients aged 12 to <17 years. Multiple intravenous doses of 3, 4, 6, 7 and \n8 mg/kg twice daily and multiple oral doses (using the powder for oral suspension) of 4 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and \n200 mg twice daily were evaluated in 3 paediatric pharmacokinetic studies. Intravenous loading doses of \n6 mg/kg IV twice daily on day 1 followed by 4 mg/kg intravenous dose twice daily and 300 mg oral tablets \ntwice daily were evaluated in one adolescent pharmacokinetic study. Larger inter-subject variability was \nobserved in paediatric patients compared to adults.\n\nA comparison of the paediatric and adult population pharmacokinetic data indicated that the predicted total \nexposure (AUC) in children following administration of a 9 mg/kg IV loading dose was comparable to that \nin adults following a 6 mg/kg IV loading dose. The predicted total exposures in children following IV \nmaintenance doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg twice daily were comparable to those in adults following 3 and 4 mg/kg \nIV twice daily, respectively. The predicted total exposure in children following an oral maintenance dose of \n9 mg/kg (maximum of 350 mg) twice daily was comparable to that in adults following 200 mg oral twice \ndaily. An 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a \n9 mg/kg oral dose.\n\nThe higher intravenous maintenance dose in paediatric patients relative to adults reflects the higher \nelimination capacity in paediatric patients due to a greater liver mass to body mass ratio. Oral bioavailability \nmay, however, be limited in paediatric patients with malabsorption and very low body weight for their age. \nIn that case, intravenous voriconazole administration is recommended. \n\nVoriconazole exposures in the majority of adolescent patients were comparable to those in adults receiving \nthe same dosing regimens. However, lower voriconazole exposure was observed in some young adolescents \nwith low body weight compared to adults. It is likely that these subjects may metabolize voriconazole more \nsimilarly to children than to adults. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, 12- to 14-year-old \nadolescents weighing less than 50 kg should receive children’s doses (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment \nIn an oral single-dose (200 mg) study in subjects with normal renal function and mild (creatinine clearance \n41-60 ml/min) to severe (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) renal impairment, the pharmacokinetics of \nvoriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment. The plasma protein binding of \nvoriconazole was similar in subjects with different degrees of renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nHepatic impairment \nAfter an oral single-dose (200 mg), AUC was 233% higher in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \ncirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Protein binding of \n\n\n\n86\n\nvoriconazole was not affected by impaired hepatic function. \n\nIn an oral multiple-dose study, AUCτ was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh \nB) given a maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily and subjects with normal hepatic function given \n200 mg twice daily. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis \n(Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies with voriconazole indicated the liver to be the target organ. Hepatotoxicity \noccurred at plasma exposures similar to those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, in common with \nother antifungal agents. In rats, mice and dogs, voriconazole also induced minimal adrenal changes. \nConventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential did not reveal a special \nhazard for humans. \n\nIn reproduction studies, voriconazole was shown to be teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits at \nsystemic exposures equal to those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses. In the pre- and post-natal \ndevelopment study in rats at exposures lower than those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses, \nvoriconazole prolonged the duration of gestation and labour and produced dystocia with consequent maternal \nmortality and reduced perinatal survival of pups. The effects on parturition are probably mediated by \nspecies-specific mechanisms, involving reduction of oestradiol levels, and are consistent with those observed \nwith other azole antifungal agents. Voriconazole administration induced no impairment of male or female \nfertility in rats at exposures similar to those obtained in humans at therapeutic doses.\n\n6.

What VFEND is and what it is used for \n\nVFEND contains the active substance voriconazole. VFEND is an antifungal medicine. It works by \nkilling or stopping the growth of the fungi that cause infections.\n\nIt is used for the treatment of patients (adults and children over the age of 2) with:\n invasive aspergillosis (a type of fungal infection due to Aspergillus sp),\n candidaemia (another type of fungal infection due to Candida sp) in non-neutropenic patients \n\n(patients without abnormally low white blood cells count),\n serious invasive Candida sp. infections when the fungus is resistant to fluconazole (another \n\nantifungal medicine),\n serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium sp. or Fusarium sp. (two different species of \n\nfungi).\n\nVFEND is intended for patients with worsening, possibly life-threatening, fungal infections.\n\nPrevention of fungal infections in high risk bone marrow transplant recipients.\n\nThis product should only be taken under the supervision of a doctor. \n\n2. What you need to know before you take VFEND \n\nDo not take VFEND:\nIf you are allergic to voriconazole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\nIt is very important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have taken any other \nmedicines, even those that are obtained without a prescription, or herbal medicines. \n\nThe medicines in the following list must not be taken during your course of VFEND treatment: \n\n Terfenadine (used for allergy) \n Astemizole (used for allergy) \n\n\n\n117\n\n Cisapride (used for stomach problems) \n Pimozide (used for treating mental illness) \n Quinidine (used for irregular heart beat) \n Rifampicin (used for treating tuberculosis)\n Efavirenz (used for treating HIV) in doses of 400 mg and above once daily\n Carbamazepine (used to treat seizures) \n Phenobarbital (used for severe insomnia and seizures) \n Ergot alkaloids (e.g., ergotamine, dihydroergotamine; used for migraine) \n Sirolimus (used in transplant patients) \n Ritonavir (used for treating HIV) in doses of 400mg and more twice daily \n St. John’s Wort (herbal supplement) \n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking VFEND if:\n\n you have had an allergic reaction to other azoles. \n you are suffering from, or have ever suffered from liver disease. If you have liver disease, your \n\ndoctor may prescribe a lower dose of VFEND. Your doctor should also monitor your liver function \nwhile you are being treated with VFEND by doing blood tests. \n\n you are known to have cardiomyopathy, irregular heart beat, slow heart rate or an abnormality of \nelectrocardiogram (ECG) called ‘long QTc syndrome’. \n\nYou should avoid any sunlight and sun exposure while being treated. It is important to cover sun exposed \nareas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF), as an increased sensitivity of skin to \nthe sun’s UV rays can occur. These precautions are also applicable to children.\n\nWhile being treated with VFEND: \n tell your doctor immediately if you develop\n\no sunburn\no severe skin rash or blisters \no bone pain\n\nIf you develop skin disorders as described above, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who after \nconsultation may decide that it is important for you to be seen on a regular basis. There is a small chance that \nskin cancer could develop with long-term use of VFEND.\n\nYour doctor should monitor the function of your liver and kidney by doing blood tests. \n\nChildren and adolescents\nVFEND should not be given to children younger than 2 years of age. \n\nOther medicines and VFEND\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including those that are obtained without a prescription. \n\nSome medicines, when taken at the same time as VFEND, may affect the way VFEND works or VFEND \nmay affect the way they work. \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking the following medicine, as treatment with VFEND at the same time should \nbe avoided if possible: \n\n Ritonavir (used for treating HIV) in doses of 100 mg twice daily\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking either of the following medicines, as treatment with VFEND at the same \ntime should be avoided if possible, and a dose adjustment of voriconazole may be required: \n\n Rifabutin (used for treating tuberculosis). If you are already being treated with rifabutin your blood \n\n\n\n118\n\ncounts and side effects to rifabutin will need to be monitored.\n Phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy). If you are already being treated with phenytoin your blood \n\nconcentration of phenytoin will need to be monitored during your treatment with VFEND and your \ndose may be adjusted.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines, as a dose adjustment or monitoring may be \nrequired to check that the medicines and/ or VFEND are still having the desired effect: \n\n Warfarin and other anticoagulants (e.g., phenprocoumon, acenocoumarol; used to slow down clotting \nof the blood) \n\n Ciclosporin (used in transplant patients) \n Tacrolimus (used in transplant patients) \n Sulfonylureas (e.g., tolbutamide, glipizide, and glyburide) (used for diabetes) \n Statins (e.g., atorvastatin, simvastatin) (used for lowering cholesterol) \n Benzodiazepines (e.g midazolam, triazolam) (used for severe insomnia and stress) \n Omeprazole (used for treating ulcers) \n Oral contraceptives (if you take VFEND whilst using oral contraceptives, you may get side effects \n\nsuch as nausea and menstrual disorders) \n Vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) (used in treating cancer) \n Indinavir and other HIV protease inhibitors (used for treating HIV) \n Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., efavirenz, delavirdine, nevirapine) (used for \n\ntreating HIV) (some doses of efavirenz can NOT be taken at the same time as VFEND)\n Methadone (used to treat heroin addiction) \n Alfentanil and fentanyl and other short-acting opiates such as sufentanil (painkillers used for surgical \n\nprocedures) \n Oxycodone and other long-acting opiates such as hydrocodone (used for moderate to severe pain)\n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, diclofenac) (used for treating pain and \n\ninflammation)\n Fluconazole (used for fungal infections)\n Everolimus (used for treating advanced kidney cancer and in transplant patients)\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nVFEND must not be taken during pregnancy, unless indicated by your doctor. Effective contraception must \nbe used in women of childbearing potential. Contact your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while \ntaking VFEND. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nVFEND may cause blurring of vision or uncomfortable sensitivity to light.

Therefore, from a microbiological point of view, the \nreconstituted solution must be used immediately. \n\nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions of the reconstituted vial prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8°C, unless reconstitution \nhas taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\nIncompatibilities: \n\nVFEND must not be infused into the same line or cannula concomitantly with other drug infusions, \nincluding parenteral nutrition (e.g., Aminofusin 10% Plus).\n\nInfusions of blood products must not occur simultaneously with VFEND. \n\nInfusion of total parenteral nutrition can occur simultaneously with VFEND but not in the same line or \ncannula. \n\nVFEND must not be diluted with 4.2% Sodium Bicarbonate Infusion.  \n\n\n\n145\n\nKit Operating Instructions for Use:\nVFEND Powder and Solvent for Solution for Infusion\n\nCritical Instructions for safe and effective use of infusion kit\nAseptic procedures will be followed during kit preparation\nBag must be inverted when the reconstituted Voriconazole is added\n\nStep 1\n1a Peel back the seal from the vial adaptor. Do not remove casing.\n1b To prepare the IV vial for reconstitution, remove the plastic cap from the vial and wipe the top with \n\nan antiseptic swab. Place the vial on a flat surface. Ensure the internal spike of the vial adaptor is \nplaced at the centre of the vial septum and push the adaptor firmly onto the vial until it snaps into \nplace.\n\n\n\n146\n\nStep 2\n2a Snap open Blue port. Bend the outer tube by 90° each way to ensure it is fully broken.\n2b Push the syringe plunger down fully. Push and screw the syringe securely onto Blue port.\n2c Withdraw exactly 19 mL of the solution and unscrew the syringe.\n\nStep 3\n3a Remove the adaptor casing from the vial adaptor and discard.\n3b Screw the syringe onto the vial adapter. Keeping the vial upright, empty contents of the syringe into \n\nthe vial.\n3c Swirl the vial gently until all the powder is dissolved. Inspect the vial. If particles are seen, swirl again \n\nand re-inspect.\n\nStep 4\n4 Gently invert the vial. Slowly draw off the required volume of the solution. The potential to block the \n\nventing action exists if large amounts of air or drug are injected when the vial is inverted. If this \noccurs, turn the vial upright and pull the piston up the syringe barrel. When cleared, proceed as \ndirected. Unscrew the syringe and discard the vial adaptor and vial.\n\n\n\n147\n\nStep 5\n5a Invert the infusion bag and screw the syringe into Blue port.\n5b Empty the contents of the syringe into the bag. Remove the syringe. Gently mix the contents of the \n\ninfusion bag. If any particles are seen, discard the infusion bag.\n\nStep 6\n6a Invert the infusion bag. Open the Twist-off port.\n6b Keeping the infusion bag inverted, connect the infusion line.\n6c Prime the IV line according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Hang the infusion bag.\n\nStep 7\n7a Attach the IV line to the patient injection site. Set the infusion rate accurately.\n7b Once the infusion delivery to the patient starts, do not manually squeeze the bag compartment as this \n\nmay interfere with the dose delivery to the patient and may cause air ingress into the IV line.\n\n\n\n148\n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n\nVFEND 40 mg/ml powder for oral suspension \nVoriconazole \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n Keep this leaflet.

The suspension should not be further \ndiluted with water or any other liquids. \n\nInstructions to constitute the suspension: \nIt is recommended that your pharmacist constitutes VFEND suspension before giving it to you.\nVFEND suspension is constituted if it is in a liquid form. If it appears to be a dry powder you should \nconstitute the oral suspension by following the instructions below. \n\n1. Tap the bottle to release the powder. \n2. Remove the cap. \n3. Add 2 measuring cups (measure cup included in the carton) of water (total of 46 ml) to the bottle.\n\nFill the measuring cup to the top of the marked line then pour the water into the bottle. You should \nalways add a total of 46 ml of water irrespective of the dose you are taking.\n\n4. Replace the cap and shake the bottle vigorously for about 1 minute. Following constitution, the total \nvolume of the suspension must be 75 ml.\n\n5. Remove the cap. Press the bottle adaptor into the neck of the bottle (as shown on figure below). The \n\n\n\n152\n\nadaptor is provided so that you can fill the oral syringe with medicine from the bottle. Replace the \ncap on the bottle. \n\n6. Write the date of expiry of the constituted suspension on the bottle label (the shelf-life of the \nconstituted suspension is 14 days). Any unused suspension should be discarded after this date.\n\nInstructions for use: \nYour pharmacist should advise you how to measure the medicine using the multi-dosing oral syringe \nprovided in the pack. Please see instructions below before using VFEND suspension. \n\n1. Shake the closed bottle of constituted suspension for approximately 10 seconds before use. Remove \nthe cap. \n\n2. While the bottle is upright, on a flat surface, insert the tip of the oral syringe into the adaptor. \n3. Turn the bottle upside down while holding the oral syringe in place. Slowly pull back the plunger of \n\nthe oral syringe to the graduation mark that marks the dose for you. To measure the dose accurately, \nthe top edge of the black ring should be lined up with the graduated mark on the oral syringe. \n\n4. If large bubbles can be seen, slowly push the plunger back into the syringe. This will force the \nmedicine back into the bottle. Repeat step 3 again.  \n\n5. Turn the bottle back upright with the oral syringe still in place. Remove the oral syringe from the \nbottle. \n\n6. Put the tip of the oral syringe into the mouth. Point the tip of the oral syringe towards the inside of \nthe cheek. SLOWLY push down the plunger of the oral syringe. Do not squirt the medicine out \nquickly. If the medicine is to be given to a child, make sure the child is sitting, or is held, upright \nbefore giving the medicine.\n\n7. Replace the cap on the bottle, leaving the bottle adaptor in place. Wash the oral syringe as instructed\nbelow. \n\n1    2       3/4               5            6\n\nCleaning and storing the syringe: \n1. The syringe should be washed after each dose. Pull the plunger out of the syringe and wash both \n\nparts in warm soapy water. Then rinse with water. \n2. Dry the two parts.  Push the plunger back in to the syringe. Keep it in a clean safe place with the \n\n\n\n153\n\nmedicine. \n\nIf you take more VFEND than you should\nIf you take more suspension than prescribed (or if someone else takes your suspension) you must seek \nmedical advice or go to the nearest hospital casualty department immediately. Take your bottle of VFEND \nsuspension with you. You may experience abnormal intolerance to light as a result of taking more VFEND \nthan you should.\n\nIf you forget to take VFEND\nIt is important to take your VFEND suspension regularly at the same time each day. If you forget to take \none dose, take your next dose when it is due. Do not take a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose. \n\nIf you stop taking VFEND\nIt has been shown that taking all doses at the appropriate times may greatly increase the effectiveness of your \nmedicine. Therefore unless your doctor instructs you to stop treatment, it is important to keep taking VFEND \ncorrectly, as described above. \n\nContinue taking VFEND until your doctor tells you to stop. Do not stop treatment early because your \ninfection may not be cured. Patients with a weakened immune system or those with difficult infections may \nrequire long-term treatment to prevent the infection from returning. \n\nWhen VFEND treatment is stopped by your doctor you should not experience any effects. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n4.
