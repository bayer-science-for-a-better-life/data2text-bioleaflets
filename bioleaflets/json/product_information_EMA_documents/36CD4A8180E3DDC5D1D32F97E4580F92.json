PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \nWhite to off-white, powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n Treatment of invasive candidiasis in adult or paediatric patients. \n Treatment of invasive aspergillosis in adult or paediatric patients who are refractory to or \n\nintolerant of amphotericin B, lipid formulations of amphotericin B and/or itraconazole. \nRefractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of \n7 days of prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy. \n\n Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections (such as Candida or Aspergillus) in febrile, \nneutropaenic adult or paediatric patients. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCaspofungin should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of invasive fungal \ninfections. \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients \nA single 70 mg loading dose should be administered on Day-1, followed by 50 mg daily thereafter. In \npatients weighing more than 80 kg, after the initial 70 mg loading dose, caspofungin 70 mg daily is \nrecommended (see section 5.2). No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender or race (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nPaediatric patients (12 months to 17 years) \nIn paediatric patients (12 months to 17 years of age), dosing should be based on the patient’s body \nsurface area (see Instructions for Use in Paediatric Patients, Mosteller1 Formula). For all indications, a \nsingle 70-mg/m2 loading dose (not to exceed an actual dose of 70 mg) should be administered on \nDay 1, followed by 50 mg/m2 daily thereafter (not to exceed an actual dose of 70 mg daily). If the \n50-mg/m2 daily dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily \ndose can be increased to 70 mg/m2 daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg).  \n                                                      \n1 Mosteller RD: Simplified Calculation of Body Surface Area. N Engl J Med 1987 Oct 22;317(17):1098 (letter) \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of caspofungin have not been sufficiently studied in clinical trials involving \nneonates and infants below 12 months of age. Caution is advised when treating this age group. Limited \ndata suggest that caspofungin at 25 mg/m2 daily in neonates and infants (less than 3 months of age) \nand 50 mg/m2 daily in young children (3 to 11 months of age) can be considered (see section 5.2). \n \nDuration of treatment \nDuration of empirical therapy should be based on the patient’s clinical response. Therapy should be \ncontinued until up to 72 hours after resolution of neutropaenia (ANC≥500). Patients found to have a \nfungal infection should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and treatment should continue for at least \n7 days after both neutropaenia and clinical symptoms are resolved. \n \nDuration of treatment of invasive candidiasis should be based upon the patient’s clinical and \nmicrobiological response. After signs and symptoms of invasive candidiasis have improved and \ncultures have become negative, a switch to oral antifungal therapy may be considered. In general, \nantifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. \n \nDuration of treatment of invasive aspergillosis is determined on a case by case basis and should be \nbased upon the severity of the patient’s underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and \nclinical response. In general, treatment should continue for at least 7 days after resolution of \nsymptoms. \n \nThe safety information on treatment durations longer than 4 weeks is limited. However, available data \nsuggest that caspofungin continues to be well tolerated with longer courses of therapy (up to 162 days \nin adult patients and up to 87 days in paediatric patients). \n \n \nElderly patients \nIn elderly patients (65 years of age or more), the area under the curve (AUC) is increased by \napproximately 30 %. However, no systematic dosage adjustment is required. There is limited \ntreatment experience in patients 65 years of age and older (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary based on renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nFor adult patients with mild hepaticimpairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), no dosage adjustment is \nneeded. For adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), Caspofungin \n35 mg daily is recommended based upon pharmacokinetic data. An initial 70 mg loading dose should \nbe administered on Day-1. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) and in paediatric patients with any degree of hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.4). \n \nCo-administration with inducers of metabolic enzymes \nLimited data suggest that an increase in the daily dose of caspofungin to 70 mg, following the 70 mg \nloading dose, should be considered when co-administering caspofungin in adult patients with certain \ninducers of metabolic enzymes (see section 4.5). When caspofungin is co-administered to paediatric \npatients (12 months to 17 years of age) with these same inducers of metabolic enzymes (see \nsection 4.5), a caspofungin dose of 70-mg/m2 daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg) \nshould be considered. \n \nMethod of administration \nAfter reconstitution and dilution, the solution should be administered by slow intravenous infusion \nover approximately 1 hour. For reconstitution directions see section 6.6. \n \nBoth 70 mg and 50 mg vials are available. \nCaspofungin should be given as a single daily infusion. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAnaphylaxis has been reported during administration of caspofungin. If this occurs, Caspofungin \nshould be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered. Possibly histamine-mediated adverse \nreactions, including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth, or bronchospasm \nhave been reported and may require discontinuation and/or administration of appropriate treatment.  \n \nLimited data suggest that less common non-Candida yeasts and non-Aspergillus moulds are not \ncovered by caspofungin. The efficacy of caspofungin against these fungal pathogens has not been \nestablished. \n \nConcomitant use of caspofungin with cyclosporin has been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and \nin adult patients. Some healthy adult volunteers who received two 3 mg/kg doses of cyclosporin with \ncaspofungin showed transient increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase \n(AST) of less than or equal to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) that resolved with \ndiscontinuation of the treatment. In a retrospective study of 40 patients treated during marketed use \nwith caspofungin and cyclosporin for 1 to 290 days (median 17.5 days), no serious hepatic adverse \nreactions were noted. These data suggest that caspofungin can be used in patients receiving \ncyclosporin when the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Close monitoring of liver enzymes \nshould be considered if caspofungin and cyclosporin are used concomitantly. \n \nIn adult patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, the AUC is increased about 20% and \n75 %, respectively. A reduction of the daily dose to 35 mg is recommended for adults with moderate \nhepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in adults with severe hepatic impairment or in \npaediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. A higher exposure than in moderate hepatic \nimpairment is expected and caspofungin should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.2 \nand 5.2). \n \nLaboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and adult and \npaediatric patients treated with caspofungin. In some adult and paediatric patients with serious \nunderlying conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications with caspofungin, cases \nof clinically significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis and hepatic failure have been reported; a causal \nrelationship to caspofungin has not been established. Patients who develop abnormal liver function \ntests during caspofungin therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and \nthe risk/benefit of continuing caspofungin therapy should be re-evaluated. \n \nThis medicinal product contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nor sucrase–isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product (see section 2). \n \nCases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported \nafter post-marketing use of caspofungin. Caution should apply in patients with history of allergic skin \nreaction (see section 4.8). \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nStudies in vitro show that caspofungin is not an inhibitor of any enzyme in the cytochrome P450 \n(CYP) system. In clinical studies, caspofungin did not induce the CYP3A4 metabolism of other \nsubstances. Caspofungin is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein and is a poor substrate for cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. However, caspofungin has been shown to interact with other medicinal products in \npharmacological and clinical studies (see below). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn two clinical studies performed in healthy adult subjects, cyclosporin A (one 4 mg/kg dose or two \n3 mg/kg doses 12 hours apart) increased the AUC of caspofungin by approximately 35 %. These AUC \nincreases are probably due to reduced uptake of caspofungin by the liver. Caspofungin did not increase \nthe plasma levels of cyclosporin. There were transient increases in liver ALT and AST of less than or \nequal to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) when caspofungin and cyclosporin were \nco-administered, that resolved with discontinuation of the medicinal products. In a retrospective study \nof 40 patients treated during marketed use with caspofungin and cyclosporin for 1 to 290 days (median \n17.5 days), no serious hepatic adverse reactions were noted (see section 4.4). Close monitoring of liver \nenzymes should be considered if the two medicinal products are used concomitantly. \n \nCaspofungin reduced the trough concentration of tacrolimus by 26 % in healthy adult volunteers. For \npatients receiving both therapies, standard monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and \nappropriate tacrolimus dosage adjustments are mandatory.  \n \nClinical studies in healthy adult volunteers show that the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin are not \naltered to a clinically relevant extent by itraconazole, amphotericin B, mycophenolate, nelfinavir, or \ntacrolimus. Caspofungin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B, itraconazole, \nrifampicin or mycophenolate mofetil. Although safety data are limited it appears that no special \nprecautions are needed when amphotericin B, itraconazole, nelfinavir or mycophenolate mofetil are \nco-administered with caspofungin. \n \nRifampicin caused a 60 % increase in AUC and 170 % increase in trough concentration of \ncaspofungin on the first day of co-administration when both medicinal products were initiated together \nin healthy adult volunteers. Caspofungin trough levels gradually decreased upon repeated \nadministration. After two weeks’ administration rifampicin had limited effect on AUC, but trough \nlevels were 30 % lower than in adult subjects who received caspofungin alone. The mechanism of \ninteraction could possibly be due to an initial inhibition and subsequent induction of transport proteins. \nA similar effect could be expected for other medicinal products that induce metabolic enzymes. \nLimited data from population pharmacokinetics studies indicate that concomitant use of caspofungin \nwith the inducers efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, or carbamazepine may \nresult in a decrease in caspofungin AUC. When co-administering inducers of metabolic enzymes, an \nincrease in the daily dose of caspofungin to 70 mg, following the 70 mg loading dose, should be \nconsidered in adult patients (see section 4.2). \n \nAll adult drug-drug interaction studies described above were conducted at a 50 or 70 mg daily \ncaspofungin dose. The interaction of higher doses of caspofungin with other medicinal products has \nnot been formally studied. \n \nIn paediatric patients, results from regression analyses of pharmacokinetic data suggest that \nco-administration of dexamethasone with caspofungin may result in clinically meaningful reductions \nin caspofungin trough concentrations. This finding may indicate that paediatric patients will have \nsimilar reductions with inducers as seen in adults. When caspofungin is co-administered to paediatric \npatients (12 months to 17 years of age) with inducers of drug clearance, such as rifampicin, efavirenz, \nnevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, a caspofungin dose of 70-mg/m2 daily (not \nto exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg) should be considered. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited data from the use of caspofungin in pregnant women. Caspofungin should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Animal studies have shown developmental toxicity \n(see section 5.3). Caspofungin has been shown to cross the placental barrier in animal studies.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether caspofungin is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/ \ntoxicological data in animals have shown excretion of caspofungin in milk. Women receiving \ncaspofungin should not breast-feed. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nFertility \nFor caspofungin, there were no effects on fertility in studies conducted in male and female rats (see \nsection 5.3). There are no clinical data for caspofungin to assess its impact on fertility.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nHypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis and possibly histamine-mediated adverse reactions) have been \nreported (see section 4.4). \n \nAlso reported in patients with invasive aspergillosis were pulmonary oedema, adult respiratory distress \nsyndrome (ARDS), and radiographic infiltrates. \n \nAdult patients \nIn clinical studies, 1,865 adult individuals received single or multiple doses of caspofungin: \n564 febrile neutropaenic patients (empirical therapy study), 382 patients with invasive candidiasis, \n228 patients with invasive aspergillosis, 297 patients with localised Candida infections, and \n394 individuals enrolled in Phase I studies. In the empirical therapy study patients had received \nchemotherapy for malignancy or had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (including \n39 allogeneic transplantations). In the studies involving patients with documented Candida infections, \nthe majority of the patients with invasive Candida infections had serious underlying medical \nconditions (e.g., haematologic or other malignancy, recent major surgery, HIV) requiring multiple \nconcomitant medications. Patients in the non-comparative Aspergillus study often had serious \npredisposing medical conditions (e.g., bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplants, haematologic \nmalignancy, solid tumours or organ transplants) requiring multiple concomitant medications. \n \nPhlebitis was a commonly reported local injection-site adverse reaction in all patient populations. \nOther local reactions included erythema, pain/tenderness, itching, discharge, and a burning sensation.  \n \nReported clinical and laboratory abnormalities among all adults treated with caspofungin (total 1,780) \nwere typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions were reportedduring clinical studies and/or post-marketing use: \n

has also been evaluated at 150 mg daily (for up to 51 days) in 100 adult patients (see \nsection 5.1). The study compared caspofungin at 50 mg daily (following a 70-mg loading dose on \nDay 1) versus 150 mg daily in the treatment of invasive candidiasis. In this group of patients, the \nsafety of caspofungin at this higher dose appeared generally similar to patients receiving the 50-mg \ndaily dose of caspofungin. The proportion of patients with a serious drug-related adverse reaction or a \ndrug-related adverse reaction leading to caspofungin discontinuation was comparable in the \n2 treatment groups. \n \nPaediatric Patients \nData from 5 clinical studies completed in 171 paediatric patients suggest that the overall incidence of \nclinical adverse experiences (26.3%; 95% CI -19.9, 33.6) is not worse than reported for adults treated \nwith caspofungin (43.1%; 95% CI -40.0, 46.2). However, paediatric patients probably have a different \nadverse event profile compared to adult patients. The most common drug-related clinical adverse \nexperiences reported in paediatric patients treated with caspofungin were pyrexia (11.7%), rash (4.7%) \nand headache (2.9%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions were reported: \n \nSystem Organ Class Very \n\ncommon \n(≥1/10) \n\nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n eosinophil count increased \n\nNervous system disorders  headache \nCardiac disorders  tachycardia \nVascular disorders  flushing, hypotension \nHepatobiliary disorders  elevated liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT) \nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n rash, pruritus \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nfever chills, catheter site pain \n\nInvestigations  decreased potassium, hypomagnesemia, increased \nglucose, decreased phosphorus, and increased \nphosphorus \n\n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nInadvertent administration of up to 400 mg of caspofungin in one day has been reported. These \noccurrences did not result in clinically important adverse reactions. Caspofungin is not dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antimycotics for systemic use, ATC code: J02AX04 \n \nMechanism of action \nCaspofungin acetate is a semi-synthetic lipopeptide (echinocandin) compound synthesised from a \nfermentation product of Glarea lozoyensis. Caspofungin acetate inhibits the synthesis of \nbeta (1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the cell wall of many filamentous fungi and yeast. \nBeta (1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. \n \nFungicidal activity with caspofungin has been demonstrated against Candida yeasts. Studies in vitro \nand in vivo demonstrate that exposure of Aspergillus to caspofungin results in lysis and death of \nhyphal apical tips and branch points where cell growth and division occur. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nCaspofungin has in vitro activity against Aspergillus species (Aspergillus fumigatus [N = 75], \nAspergillus flavus [N = 111], Aspergillus niger [N = 31], Aspergillus nidulans [N = 8], Aspergillus \nterreus [N = 52], and Aspergillus candidus [N = 3]). Caspofungin also has in vitro activity against \nCandida species (Candida albicans [N = 1,032], Candida dubliniensis [N = 100], Candida glabrata \n[N = 151], Candida guilliermondii [N = 67], Candida kefyr [N = 62], Candida krusei [N = 147], \nCandida lipolytica [N = 20], Candida lusitaniae [N = 80], Candida parapsilosis [N = 215], Candida \nrugosa [N = 1], and Candida tropicalis [N = 258]), including isolates with multiple resistance \ntransport mutations and those with acquired or intrinsic resistance to fluconazole, amphotericin B, and \n5-flucytosine. Susceptibility testing was performed according to a modification of both the Clinical \nand Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly known as the National Committee for Clinical \nLaboratory Standards [NCCLS]) method M38-A2 (for Aspergillus species) and method M27-A3 (for \nCandida species).  \nStandardised techniques for susceptibility testing have been established for yeasts by EUCAST.  \nEUCAST breakpoints have not yet been established for caspofungin, due to significant \ninter-laboratory variation in MIC ranges for caspofungin. In lieu of breakpoints, Candida isolates that \nare susceptible to anidulafungin as well as micafungin should be considered susceptible to \ncaspofungin. Similarly, C. parapsilosis isolates intermediate to anidulafungin and micafungin can be \nregarded intermediate to caspofungin. \n \nMechanism of resistance \n Isolates  of Candida with reduced susceptibility to caspofungin have been identified in a small number \nof patients during treatment (MICs for caspofungin >2 mg/L (4- to 30-fold MIC increases) have been \nreported using standardized MIC testing techniques approved by the CLSI). The mechanism of \nresistance identified  is FKS1 and/or  FKS2  (for C. glabrata)  gene mutations. These cases have been \nassociated with poor clinical outcomes.  \nDevelopment of in vitro resistance to caspofungin by Aspergillus species has been identified. In \nlimited clinical experience, resistance to caspofungin in patients with invasive aspergillosis has been \nobserved. The mechanism of resistance has not been established. The incidence of resistance to \n\n\n\n10 \n\ncaspofungin by various clinical isolates of Aspergillus is rare. Caspofungin resistance in Candida has \nbeen observed but the incidence may differ by species or region. \nClinical efficacy and safety \nInvasive Candidiasis in Adult Patients: Two hundred thirty-nine patients were enrolled in an initial \nstudy to compare caspofungin and amphotericin B for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. Twenty-\nfour patients had neutropaenia. The most frequent diagnoses were bloodstream infections \n(candidaemia) (77 %, n=186) and Candida peritonitis (8 %, n=19); patients with Candida \nendocarditis, osteomyelitis, or meningitis were excluded from this study. Caspofungin 50 mg once \ndaily was administered following a 70 mg loading dose, while amphotericin B was administered at 0.6 \nto 0.7 mg/kg/day to non-neutropaenic patients or 0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg/day to neutropaenic patients. The \nmean duration of intravenous therapy was 11.9 days, with a range of 1 to 28 days. A favourable \nresponse required both symptom resolution and microbiological clearance of the Candida infection. \nTwo hundred twenty-four patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis (MITT analysis) of \nresponse at the end of IV study therapy; favourable response rates for the treatment of invasive \ncandidiasis were comparable for caspofungin (73 % [80/109]) and amphotericin B (62 % [71/115]) [% \ndifference 12.7 (95.6 % CI -0.7, 26.0)]. Among patients with candidaemia, favourable response rates \nat the end of IV study therapy were comparable for caspofungin (72 % [66/92]) and amphotericin B \n(63 % [59/94]) in the primary efficacy analysis (MITT analysis) [% difference 10.0 (95.0 % CI -4.5, \n24.5)]. Data in patients with non-blood sites of infection were more limited. Favourable response rates \nin neutropaenic patients were 7/14 (50 %) in the caspofungin group and 4/10 (40 %) in the \namphotericin B group. These limited data are supported by the outcome of the empirical therapy \nstudy. \n \nIn a second study, patients with invasive candidiasis received daily doses of caspofungin at 50 mg/day \n(following a 70-mg loading dose on Day 1) or caspofungin at 150 mg/day (see section 4.8). In this \nstudy, the caspofungin dose was administered over 2 hours (instead of the routine 1-hour \nadministration). The study excluded patients with suspected Candida endocarditis, meningitis, or \nosteomyelitis. As this was a primary therapy study, patients who were refractory to prior antifungal \nagents were also excluded. The number of neutropenic patients enrolled in this study was also limited \n(8.0 %). Efficacy was a secondary endpoint in this study. Patients who met the entry criteria and \nreceived one or more doses of caspofungin study therapy were included in the efficacy analysis. The \nfavourable overall response rates at the end of caspofungin therapy were similar in the 2 treatment \ngroups: 72 % (73/102) and 78 % (74/95) for the caspofungin 50-mg and 150-mg treatment groups, \nrespectively (difference 6.3 % [95 % CI -5.9, 18.4]). \n \nInvasive Aspergillosis in Adult Patients: Sixty-nine adult patients (age 18-80) with invasive \naspergillosis were enrolled in an open-label, non-comparative study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, \nand efficacy of caspofungin. Patients had to be either refractory to (disease progression or failure to \nimprove with other antifungal therapies given for at least 7 days) (84 % of the enrolled patients) or \nintolerant of (16 % of enrolled patients) other standard antifungal therapies. Most patients had \nunderlying conditions (haematologic malignancy [N = 24], allogeneic bone marrow transplant or stem \ncell transplant [N = 18], organ transplant [N = 8], solid tumour [N = 3], or other conditions [N = 10]). \nStringent definitions, modelled after the Mycoses Study Group Criteria, were used for diagnosis of \ninvasive aspergillosis and for response to therapy (favourable response required clinically significant \nimprovement in radiographs as well as in signs and symptoms). The mean duration of therapy was \n33.7 days, with a range of 1 to 162 days. An independent expert panel determined that 41 % (26/63) of \npatients receiving at least one dose of caspofungin had a favourable response. For those patients who \nreceived more than 7 days of therapy with caspofungin, 50 % (26/52) had a favourable response. The \nfavourable response rates for patients who were either refractory to or intolerant of previous therapies \nwere 36 % (19/53) and 70 % (7/10), respectively. Although the doses of prior antifungal therapies in \n5 patients enrolled as refractory were lower than those often administered for invasive aspergillosis, \nthe favourable response rate during therapy with caspofungin was similar in these patients to that seen \nin the remaining refractory patients (2/5 versus 17/48, respectively). The response rates among \npatients with pulmonary disease and extrapulmonary disease were 47 % (21/45) and 28 % (5/18), \nrespectively. Among patients with extrapulmonary disease, 2 of 8 patients who also had definite, \nprobable, or possible CNS involvement had a favourable response. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nEmpirical Therapy in Febrile, Neutropaenic Adult Patients: A total of 1,111 patients with persistent \nfever and neutropaenia were enrolled in a clinical study and treated with either caspofungin 50 mg \nonce daily following a 70 mg loading dose or liposomal amphotericin B 3.0 mg/kg/day. Eligible \npatients had received chemotherapy for malignancy or had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell \ntransplantation, and presented with neutropaenia (<500 cells/mm3 for 96 hours) and fever (>38.0°C) \nnot responding to ≥96 hours of parenteral antibacterial therapy. Patients were to be treated until up to \n72 hours after resolution of neutropaenia, with a maximum duration of 28 days. However, patients \nfound to have a documented fungal infection could be treated longer. If the drug was well tolerated but \nthe patient’s fever persisted and clinical condition deteriorated after 5 days of therapy, the dosage of \nstudy drug could be increased to 70 mg/day of caspofungin (13.3 % of patients treated) or to \n5.0 mg/kg/day of liposomal amphotericin B (14.3 % of patients treated). There were 1,095 patients \nincluded in the primary Modified Intention-To-Treat (MITT) efficacy analysis of overall favourable \nresponse; caspofungin (33.9 %) was as effective as liposomal amphotericin B (33.7 %) [% difference \n0.2 (95.2 % CI –5.6, 6.0)]. An overall favourable response required meeting each of 5 criteria: \n(1) successful treatment of any baseline fungal infection (caspofungin 51.9 % [14/27], liposomal \namphotericin B 25.9 % [7/27]), (2) no breakthrough fungal infections during administration of study \ndrug or within 7 days after completion of treatment (caspofungin 94.8 % [527/556], liposomal \namphotericin B 95.5 % [515/539]), (3) survival for 7 days after completion of study therapy \n(caspofungin 92.6 % [515/556], liposomal amphotericin B 89.2 % [481/539]), (4) no discontinuation \nfrom the study drug because of drug-related toxicity or lack of efficacy (caspofungin 89.7 % \n[499/556], liposomal amphotericin B 85.5 % [461/539]), and (5) resolution of fever during the period \nof neutropaenia (caspofungin 41.2 % [229/556], liposomal amphotericin B 41.4 % [223/539]). \nResponse rates to caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B for baseline infections caused by \nAspergillus species were, respectively, 41.7 % (5/12) and 8.3 % (1/12), and by Candida species were \n66.7 % (8/12) and 41.7 % (5/12). Patients in the caspofungin group experienced breakthrough \ninfections due to the following uncommon yeasts and moulds: Trichosporon species (1), Fusarium \nspecies (1), Mucor species (1), and Rhizopus species (1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of caspofungin was evaluated in paediatric patients 3 months to 17 years of \nage in two prospective, multicentre clinical trials. The study design, diagnostic criteria, and criteria for \nefficacy assessment were similar to the corresponding studies in adult patients (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe first study, which enrolled 82 patients between 2 to 17 years of age, was a randomized, double-\nblind study comparing caspofungin (50 mg/m2 IV once daily following a 70-mg/m2 loading dose on \nDay 1 [not to exceed 70 mg daily]) to liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg IV daily) in a 2:1 treatment \nfashion (56 on caspofungin, 26 on liposomal amphotericin B) as empirical therapy in paediatric \npatients with persistent fever and neutropenia. The overall success rates in the MITT analysis results, \nadjusted by risk strata, were as follows: 46.6 % (26/56) for caspofungin and 32.2 % (8/25) for \nliposomal amphotericin B.  \n \nThe second study was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative study estimating the safety and \nefficacy of caspofungin in paediatric patients (ages 6 months to 17 years) with invasive candidiasis, \nesophageal candidiasis, and invasive aspergillosis (as salvage therapy). Forty-nine patients were \nenrolled and received caspofungin at 50 mg/m2 IV once daily following a 70-mg/m2 loading dose on \nDay 1 (not to exceed 70 mg daily), of whom 48 were included in the MITT analysis. Of these, 37 had \ninvasive candidiasis, 10 had invasive aspergillosis, and 1 patient had esophageal candidiasis. The \nfavourable response rate, by indication, at the end of caspofungin therapy was as follows in the MITT \nanalysis: 81 % (30/37) in invasive candidiasis, 50 % (5/10) in invasive aspergillosis, and 100 % (1/1) \nin esophageal candidiasis. \n \nIn a double-blind, randomized (2:1) comparator-controlled study safety, tolerability and efficacy of \ncaspofungin (2 mg/kg/d intravenously, infused over 2 hours) vs amphotericin B deoxycholate \n(1 mg/kg/d) was evaluated in neonates and infants less than 3 months of age with (culture-confirmed) \ninvasive candidiasis. Due to poor enrolment, the study was terminated early and only 51 patients were \nrandomized. The proportion of patients with fungal-free survival at 2 weeks post-therapy in the \ncaspofungin treatment group (71.0 %) was similar to that seen in the amphotericin B deoxycholate \n\n\n\n12 \n\ntreatment group (68.8 %). Based on this study, no posology recommendations for neonates and infants \ncan be made. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nCaspofungin is extensively bound to albumin. The unbound fraction of caspofungin in plasma varies \nfrom 3.5 % in healthy volunteers to 7.6 % in patients with invasive candidiasis. Distribution plays the \nprominent role in caspofungin plasma pharmacokinetics and is the rate-controlling step in both the \nalpha- and beta-disposition phases. The distribution into tissues peaked at 1.5 to 2 days after dosing \nwhen 92 % of the dose was distributed into tissues. It is likely that only a small fraction of the \ncaspofungin taken up into tissues later returns to plasma as parent compound. Therefore, elimination \noccurs in the absence of a distribution equilibrium, and a true estimate of the volume of distribution of \ncaspofungin is currently impossible to obtain. \n \nBiotransformation \nCaspofungin undergoes spontaneous degradation to an open ring compound. Further metabolism \ninvolves peptide hydrolysis and N-acetylation. Two intermediate products, formed during the \ndegradation of caspofungin to this open ring compound, form covalent adducts to plasma proteins \nresulting in a low-level, irreversible binding to plasma proteins.  \n \nIn vitro studies show that caspofungin is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2, 2A6, \n2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4. In clinical studies, caspofungin did not induce or inhibit the CYP3A4 \nmetabolism of other medicinal products. Caspofungin is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein and is a \npoor substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nElimination \nThe elimination of caspofungin from plasma is slow with a clearance of 10-12 mL/min. Plasma \nconcentrations of caspofungin decline in a polyphasic manner following single 1-hour intravenous \ninfusions. A short alpha-phase occurs immediately post-infusion, followed by a beta-phase with a half-\nlife of 9 to 11 hours. An additional gamma-phase also occurs with a half-life of 45 hours. Distribution, \nrather than excretion or biotransformation, is the dominant mechanism influencing plasma clearance.  \n \nApproximately 75 % of a radioactive dose was recovered during 27 days: 41 % in urine and 34 % in \nfaeces. There is little excretion or biotransformation of caspofungin during the first 30 hours after \nadministration. Excretion is slow and the terminal half-life of radioactivity was 12 to 15 days. A small \namount of caspofungin is excreted unchanged in urine (approximately 1.4 % of dose). \n \nCaspofungin displays moderate non-linear pharmacokinetics with increased accumulation as the dose \nis increased, and a dose dependency in the time to reach steady state upon multiple-dose \nadministration. \n \nSpecial populations \nIncreased caspofungin exposure was seen in adult patients with renal impairment and mild liver \nimpairment, in female subjects, and in the elderly. Generally the increase was modest and not large \nenough to warrant dosage adjustment. In adult patients with moderate liver impairment or in higher \nweight patients, a dosage adjustment may be necessary (see below). \n \nWeight: Weight was found to influence caspofungin pharmacokinetics in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis in adult candidiasis patients. The plasma concentrations decrease with \nincreasing weight. The average exposure in an adult patient weighing 80 kg was predicted to be about \n23 % lower than in an adult patient weighing 60 kg (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment: In adult patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, the AUC is \nincreased about 20 and 75 %, respectively. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe \nhepatic impairment and in paediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. In a \nmultiple-dose study, a dose reduction of the daily dose to 35 mg in adult patients with moderate \n\n\n\n13 \n\nhepatic impairment has been shown to provide an AUC similar to that obtained in adult subjects with \nnormal hepatic function receiving the standard regimen (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment: In a clinical study of single 70 mg doses, caspofungin pharmacokinetics were \nsimilar in adult volunteers with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) and \ncontrol subjects. Moderate (creatinine clearance 31 to 49 mL/min), advanced (creatinine clearance 5 to \n30 mL/min), and end-stage (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min and dialysis dependent) renal \nimpairment moderately increased caspofungin plasma concentrations after single-dose administration \n(range: 30 to 49 % for AUC). However, in adult patients with invasive candidiasis, oesophageal \ncandidiasis, or invasive aspergillosis who received multiple daily doses of caspofungin 50 mg, there \nwas no significant effect of mild to advanced renal impairment on caspofungin concentrations. No \ndosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Caspofungin is not dialysable, thus \nsupplementary dosing is not required following haemodialysis.  \n \nGender: Caspofungin plasma concentrations were on average 17-38 % higher in women than in men.  \n \nElderly: A modest increase in AUC (28 %) and C24h (32 %) was observed in elderly male subjects \ncompared with young male subjects. In patients who were treated empirically or who had invasive \ncandidiasis, a similar modest effect of age was seen in older patients relative to younger patients. \n \nRace: Patient pharmacokinetic data indicated that no clinically significant differences in the \npharmacokinetics of caspofungin were seen among Caucasians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Mestizos. \n \nPaediatric Patients: \nIn adolescents (ages 12 to 17 years) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/m2 daily (maximum 70 mg daily), \nthe caspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr was generally comparable to that seen in adults receiving \ncaspofungin at 50 mg daily. All adolescents received doses >50 mg daily, and, in fact, 6 of 8 received \nthe maximum dose of 70 mg/day. The caspofungin plasma concentrations in these adolescents were \nreduced relative to adults receiving 70 mg daily, the dose most often administered to adolescents. \n \nIn children (ages 2 to 11 years) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/m2 daily (maximum 70 mg daily), the \ncaspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr after multiple doses was comparable to that seen in adults receiving \ncaspofungin at 50 mg/day.  \n \nIn young children and toddlers (ages 12 to 23 months) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/m2 daily \n(maximum 70 mg daily), the caspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr after multiple doses was comparable to \nthat seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg daily and to that in older children (2 to 11 years of \nage) receiving the 50 mg/m2 daily dose. \n \nOverall, the available pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data are limited in patients 3 to 10 months \nof age. Pharmacokinetic data from one 10-month old child receiving the 50 mg/m2 daily dose \nindicated an AUC0-24 hr within the same range as that observed in older children and adults at the \n50 mg/m2 and the 50 mg dose, respectively, while in one 6-month old child receiving the 50 mg/m2 \ndose, the AUC0-24 hr was somewhat higher.  \n \nIn neonates and infants (<3 months) receiving caspofungin at 25 mg/m2 daily (corresponding mean \ndaily dose of 2.1 mg/kg), caspofungin peak concentration (C1 hr) and caspofungin trough concentration \n(C24 hr) after multiple doses were comparable to that seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg \ndaily. On Day 1, C1 hr was comparable and C24 hr modestly elevated (36 %) in these neonates and \ninfants relative to adults. However, variability was seen in both C1 hr (Day 4 geometric mean \n11.73 µg/mL, range 2.63 to 22.05 µg/mL) and C24 hr (Day 4 geometric mean 3.55 µg/mL, range 0.13 to \n7.17 µg/mL). AUC0-24 hr measurements were not performed in this study due to the sparse plasma \nsampling. Of note, the efficacy and safety of caspofungin have not been adequately studied in \nprospective clinical trials involving neonates and infants under 3 months of age. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys using doses up to 7-8 mg/kg given intravenously \nshowed injection site reactions in rats and monkeys, signs of histamine release in rats, and evidence of \nadverse effects directed at the liver in monkeys. Developmental toxicity studies in rats showed that \ncaspofungin caused decreases in foetal body weights and an increase in the incidence of incomplete \nossification of vertebra, sternebra, and skull bone at doses of 5 mg/kg that were coupled to adverse \nmaternal effects such as signs of histamine release in pregnant rats. An increase in the incidence of \ncervical ribs was also noted. Caspofungin was negative in in vitro assays for potential genotoxicity as \nwell as in the in vivo mouse bone marrow chromosomal test. No long-term studies in animals have \nbeen performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential. For caspofungin, there were no effects on \nfertility in studies conducted in male and female rats up to 5 mg/kg/day. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Caspofungin Accord is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Caspofungin Accord is \nCaspofungin Accord contains a medicine called caspofungin. This belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled anti-fungals.  \n \nWhat Caspofungin Accord is used for \nCaspofungin Accord is used to treat the following infections in children, adolescents and adults: \n serious fungal infections in your tissues or organs (called ‘invasive candidiasis’). This infection \n\nis caused by fungal (yeast) cells called Candida.  \nPeople who might get this type of infection include those who have just had an operation or \nthose whose immune systems are weak. Fever and chills that do not respond to an antibiotic are \nthe most common signs of this type of infection. \n\n fungal infections in your nose, nasal sinuses or lungs (called ‘invasive aspergillosis’) if other \nanti-fungal treatments have not worked or have caused side effects. This infection is caused by a \nmould called Aspergillus.  \nPeople who might get this type of infection include those having chemotherapy, those who have \nhad a transplant and those whose immune systems are weak. \n\n suspected fungal infections if you have a fever and a low white cell count that have not \nimproved on  treatment with an antibiotic. People who are at risk of getting a fungal infection \ninclude those who have just had an operation or those whose immune systems are weak.  \n\n \nHow Caspofungin Accord works \nCaspofungin Accord makes fungal cells fragile and stops the fungus from growing properly. This \nstops the infection from spreading and gives the body’s natural defences a chance to completely get rid \nof the infection.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Caspofungin Accord \n \nDo not use Caspofungin Accord \n \n\n -if you are allergic to caspofungin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n\n\n32 \n\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given your medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Caspofungin Accord if: \n you are allergic to any other medicines \n you have ever had liver problems - you might need a different dose of this medicine \n you are already taking cyclosporin (used to help prevent organ transplant rejection or to \n\nsuppress your immune system) - as your doctor may need to run extra blood tests during your \ntreatment. \n\n if you have ever had any other medical problem.  \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before \nyou are given Caspofungin Accord. \n \nCaspofungin Accord  may also cause Serious Cutaneous Adverse Reactions such as Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). \n \nOther medicines and Caspofungin Accord \nPlease tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. \nThis is because Caspofungin Accord can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other \nmedicines can affect the way Caspofungin Accord works.  \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n cyclosporin or tacrolimus (used to help prevent organ transplant rejection or to suppress your \n\nimmune system) as your doctor may need to run extra blood tests during your treatment \n some HIV medicines such as efavirenz or nevirapine \n phenytoin or carbamazepine (used for the treatment of seizures)  \n dexamethasone (a steroid) \n rifampicin (an antibiotic). \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before \nyou are given Caspofungin Accord.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding ,think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n Caspofungin Accord has not been studied in pregnant women. It should be used in pregnancy \n\nonly if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the unborn baby.  \n Women given Caspofungin Accord should not breast-feed. \n \n\nDriving and using machines \nThere is no information to suggest that Caspofungin Accord affects your ability to drive or operate \nmachinery. \n \n \n\n3. How to use Caspofungin Accord \n \nCaspofungin Accord will always be prepared and given to you by a healthcare professional. \nYou will be given Caspofungin Accord: \n once each day \n by slow injection into a vein (intravenous infusion)  \n over about 1 hour.  \n \nYour doctor will determine the duration of your treatment and how much Caspofungin Accord you \nwill be given each day. Your doctor will monitor how well the medicine works for you. If you weigh \nmore than 80 kg, you may need a different dose. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe dose for children and adolescents may differ from the adult dose. \n \nIf you have been given more Caspofungin Accord than you should \n \nYour doctor will decide how much Caspofungin Accord you need and for how long each day. If you \nare worried that you may have been given too much Caspofungin Accord, tell your doctor or nurse \nstraight away. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
