NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEviplera 200 mg/25 mg/245 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg of emtricitabine, 25 mg of rilpivirine (as hydrochloride) and \n245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 277 mg lactose monohydrate and 4 micrograms sunset yellow \naluminium lake (E110). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPurplish-pink, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet of dimensions 19 mm x 8.5 mm, debossed on one \nside with \u201cGSI\u201d and plain on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEviplera is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 \n(HIV-1) without known mutations associated with resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class, tenofovir or emtricitabine, and with a viral load \u2264 100,000 \nHIV-1 RNA copies/mL (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nGenotypic resistance testing and/or historical resistance data should guide the use of Eviplera (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEviplera should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of Eviplera is one tablet, taken orally, once daily.  Eviplera must be taken \nwith food (see section 5.2). \n \nWhere discontinuation of therapy with one of the components of Eviplera is indicated or where dose \nmodification is necessary, separate preparations of emtricitabine, rilpivirine hydrochloride and \ntenofovir disoproxil are available.  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for these \nmedicinal products. \n \nIf a patient misses a dose of Eviplera within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Eviplera with food as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient \nmisses a dose of Eviplera by more than 12 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and \nsimply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nIf a patient vomits within 4 hours of taking Eviplera another Eviplera tablet should be taken with food.  \nIf a patient vomits more than 4 hours after taking Eviplera they do not need to take another dose of \nEviplera until the next regularly scheduled dose. \n \nDose adjustment \nIf Eviplera is co-administered with rifabutin, an additional 25 mg tablet of rilpivirine per day is \nrecommended to be taken concomitantly with Eviplera, for the duration of the rifabutin co-\nadministration (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nEviplera has not been studied in patients over the age of 65 years.  Eviplera should be administered \nwith caution to elderly patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nTreatment with Eviplera resulted in an early small increase of mean serum creatinine levels which \nremained stable over time and is not considered clinically relevant (see section 4.8). \n \nLimited data from clinical studies support once daily dosing of Eviplera in patients with mild renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance (CrCl) 50-80 mL/min).  However, long-term safety data for the \nemtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil components of Eviplera have not been evaluated in patients \nwith mild renal impairment.  Therefore, in patients with mild renal impairment Eviplera should only \nbe used if the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risks (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nEviplera is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl \n< 50 mL/min).  Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require a dose interval adjustment \nof emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere is limited information regarding the use of Eviplera in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) Score A or B).  No dose adjustment of Eviplera is required in \npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  Eviplera should be used with caution in patients \nwith moderate hepatic impairment.  Eviplera has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (CPT Score C).  Therefore, Eviplera is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIf Eviplera is discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV), these patients \nshould be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Eviplera in children under the age of 18 years have not been established.  \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nPregnancy \nLower exposures of rilpivirine (one of the components of Eviplera) were observed during pregnancy; \ntherefore viral load should be monitored closely.  Alternatively, switching to another antiretroviral \nregimen could be considered (see sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEviplera must be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2).  It is recommended that Eviplera \nbe swallowed whole with water.  The film-coated tablet should not be chewed, crushed or split as it \nmay impact the absorption of Eviplera. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nEviplera should not be co-administered with the following medicinal products as significant decreases \nin rilpivirine plasma concentrations may occur (due to cytochrome P450 [CYP]3A enzyme induction \nor gastric pH increase), which may result in loss of therapeutic effect of Eviplera: \n\u2022 the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \n\u2022 the antimycobacterials rifampicin, rifapentine \n\u2022 proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, \n\nrabeprazole \n\u2022 the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, except as a single dose treatment \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nVirologic failure and development of resistance \n \nEviplera has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other antiretroviral \ntherapy.  There is not sufficient data to justify the use in patients with prior NNRTI failure.  Resistance \ntesting and/or historical resistance data should guide the use of Eviplera (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the pooled efficacy analysis from the two Phase III clinical studies (C209 [ECHO] and C215 \n[THRIVE]) through 96 weeks, patients treated with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil + rilpivirine \nwith a baseline viral load > 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL had a greater risk of virologic failure \n(17.6% with rilpivirine versus 7.6% with efavirenz) compared to patients with a baseline viral load \n\u2264 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (5.9% with rilpivirine versus 2.4% with efavirenz).  The virologic \nfailure rate in patients treated with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil + rilpivirine at week 48 and \nweek 96 was 9.5% and 11.5% respectively, and 4.2% and 5.1% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil + efavirenz arm.  The difference in the rate of new virologic failures from the week 48 to \nweek 96 analysis between rilpivirine and efavirenz arms was not statistically significant.  Patients with \na baseline viral load > 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL who experienced virologic failure exhibited a \nhigher rate of treatment-emergent resistance to the NNRTI class.  More patients who failed \nvirologically on rilpivirine than who failed virologically on efavirenz developed \nlamivudine/emtricitabine associated resistance (see section 5.1). \n \nCardiovascular \n \nAt supratherapeutic doses (75 mg and 300 mg once daily), rilpivirine has been associated with \nprolongation of the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  \nRilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant \neffect on QTc.  Eviplera should be used with caution when co-administered with medicinal products \nwith a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n \nEviplera should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \nemtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, or other cytidine analogues, such as \nlamivudine (see section 4.5).  Eviplera should not be administered concomitantly with rilpivirine \nhydrochloride unless needed for dose adjustment with rifabutin (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).  Eviplera \nshould not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCo-administration of Eviplera and didanosine is not recommended since exposure to didanosine is \nsignificantly increased following co-administration with tenofovir disoproxil, which may increase the \nrisk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5).  Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, \nsometimes fatal, have been reported. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nEviplera is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl \n< 50 mL/min).  Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require a dose interval adjustment \nof emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).  Use of Eviplera should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a \nnephrotoxic medicinal product (see section 4.5).  If concomitant use of Eviplera and nephrotoxic \nagents is unavoidable, renal function must be monitored weekly (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \nfor renal dysfunction.  If Eviplera is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be \nmonitored adequately. \n \nRenal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy \n(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical \npractice (see section 4.8). \n \nIt is recommended that CrCl is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with Eviplera and \nrenal function (CrCl and serum phosphate) is also monitored after two to four weeks of treatment, \nafter three months of treatment and every three to six months thereafter in patients without renal risk \nfactors.  In patients at risk for renal impairment, a more frequent monitoring of renal function is \nrequired. \n \nIf serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dL (0.48 mmol/L) or CrCl is decreased to < 50 mL/min in any patient \nreceiving Eviplera, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of \nblood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal \ntubulopathy).  Since Eviplera is a combination product and the dosing interval of the individual \ncomponents cannot be altered, treatment with Eviplera must be interrupted in patients with confirmed \nCrCl decreased to < 50 mL/min or decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L).  \nInterrupting treatment with Eviplera should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal \nfunction when no other cause has been identified.  Where discontinuation of therapy with one of the \ncomponents of Eviplera is indicated or where dose modification is necessary, separate preparations of \nemtricitabine, rilpivirine hydrochloride and tenofovir disoproxil are available. \n \nBone effects \n \nA dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) substudy for both the Phase III studies (C209 and C215) \ninvestigated the effect of rilpivirine as compared with control, overall and by background regimen on \nchanges in whole body bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) at week 48 and \nweek 96.  DXA substudies showed that small but statistically significant decreases from baseline in \nwhole body BMD and BMC were similar for rilpivirine and control at week 48 and week 96.  There \nwas no difference in the change from baseline in whole body BMD or BMC for rilpivirine compared \nwith control, in the overall population or in those patients treated with a backbone regimen including \ntenofovir disoproxil. \n \nIn a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil with stavudine in \ncombination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients, small decreases in BMD of \nthe hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups.  Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in \nbone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at \n144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip were significantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHowever, there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically relevant bone \nabnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \ninhibitor (PI).  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that \nare at a high risk for fractures. \n \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8).  If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation \nshould be obtained. \n \nPatients with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus co-infection \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nPhysicians should refer to current HIV treatment guidelines for the optimal management of \nHIV infection in patients co-infected with HBV. \n \nIn case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary \nof Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eviplera have not been established for the treatment of chronic \nHBV infection.  Emtricitabine and tenofovir individually and in combination have shown activity \nagainst HBV in pharmacodynamic studies (see section 5.1). \n \nDiscontinuation of Eviplera therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with \nsevere acute exacerbations of hepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue \nEviplera should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several \nmonths after stopping treatment.  If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.  \nIn patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended \nsince post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n \nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eviplera have not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders.  The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine has not been studied in patients with hepatic \nimpairment.  Emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver \nimpairment should be limited.  No dose adjustment is required for rilpivirine hydrochloride in patients \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment (CPT Score A or B).  Rilpivirine hydrochloride has not \nbeen studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPT Score C).  The pharmacokinetics of \ntenofovir has been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and no dose adjustment is required in \nthese patients. \n \nIt is unlikely that a dose adjustment would be required for Eviplera in patients with mild or moderate \nhepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  Eviplera should be used with caution in patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment (CPT Score B) and is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (CPT Score C). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSevere skin reactions \n \nCases of severe skin reactions with systemic symptoms have been reported during post-marketing \nexperience with Eviplera, including but not limited to rashes accompanied by fever, blisters, \nconjunctivitis, angioedema, elevated liver function tests, and/or eosinophilia.  These symptoms \nresolved after Eviplera was discontinued.  As soon as serious skin and/or mucosal reactions are \nobserved, Eviplera must be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nElderly \n \nEviplera has not been studied in patients over the age of 65 years.  Elderly patients are more likely to \nhave decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients \nwith Eviplera (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nPregnancy \n \nLower exposures of rilpivirine were observed when rilpivirine 25 mg once daily was taken during \npregnancy.  In the Phase III studies (C209 and C215), lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that seen \nduring pregnancy, has been associated with an increased risk of virological failure, therefore viral load \nshould be monitored closely (see sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2).  Alternatively, switching to another \nantiretroviral regimen could be considered. \n \nExcipients \n \nEviplera contains lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \nEviplera contains a colourant called sunset yellow aluminium lake (E110), which may cause allergic \nreactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs Eviplera contains emtricitabine, rilpivirine hydrochloride and tenofovir disoproxil, any interactions \nthat have been identified with these active substances individually may occur with Eviplera.  \nInteraction studies with these active substances have only been performed in adults. \n \nRilpivirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A  Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may \nthus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated \n \nCo-administration of Eviplera and medicinal products that induce CYP3A has been observed to \ndecrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could potentially lead to loss of therapeutic \neffect of Eviplera (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of Eviplera with proton pump inhibitors has been observed to decrease the plasma \nconcentrations of rilpivirine (due to an increase in gastric pH) which could potentially lead to loss of \ntherapeutic effect of Eviplera (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nEviplera should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \nemtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide.  Eviplera should not be administered \nconcomitantly with rilpivirine hydrochloride unless needed for dose adjustment with rifabutin (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDue to similarities with emtricitabine, Eviplera should not be administered concomitantly with other \ncytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.4).  Eviplera should not be administered \nconcomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nDidanosine \nThe co-administration of Eviplera and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 1). \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products \nSince emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of \nEviplera with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion \n(e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the \nco-administered medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nUse of Eviplera should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product.  \nSome examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, \nganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (also called aldesleukin). \n \nOther NNRTIs \nIt is not recommended to co-administer Eviplera with other NNRTIs. \n \nConcomitant use where caution is recommended \n \nCytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors \nCo-administration of Eviplera with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A enzyme activity has been \nobserved to increase rilpivirine plasma concentrations. \n \nQT prolonging medicinal products \nEviplera should be used with caution when co-administered with a medicinal product with a known \nrisk of Torsade de Pointes.  There is limited information available on the potential for a \npharmacodynamic interaction between rilpivirine and medicinal products that prolong the \nQTc interval of the electrocardiogram.  In a study of healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of \nrilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of \nthe ECG (see section 5.1). \n \nP-glycoprotein substrates \nRilpivirine inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro (IC50 is 9.2 \u00b5M).  In a clinical study rilpivirine did \nnot significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.  However, it may not be completely excluded \nthat rilpivirine can increase the exposure to other medicinal products transported by P-gp that are more \nsensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition (e.g. dabigatran etexilate). \n \nRilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE-2K with an IC50 of < 2.7 nM.  The clinical \nimplications of this finding are currently unknown. \n \nOther interactions \n \nInteractions between Eviplera or its individual component(s) and co-administered medicinal products \nare listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d and no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 1: Interactions between Eviplera or its individual component(s) and other medicinal \nproducts \n \n\nMedicinal product by therapeutic \nareas \n\nEffects on medicinal product \nlevels. \n\nMean percent change in AUC, \nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with Eviplera \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntiretrovirals \nNucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs/N[t]RTIs) \nDidanosine/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied.

Lower exposures of rilpivirine were observed during \npregnancy; therefore viral load should be monitored closely.  A large amount of data on pregnant \nwomen (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative nor foetal/neonatal toxicity \nassociated with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3) with the components of Eviplera. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Eviplera during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are excreted in human milk.  It is not known whether rilpivirine \nis excreted in human milk. \n \nThere is insufficient information on the effects of Eviplera in newborns/infants.  Breast-feeding should \nbe discontinued during treatment with Eviplera. \n \nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Eviplera on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of emtricitabine, rilpivirine hydrochloride or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEviplera has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  However, patients \nshould be informed that fatigue, dizziness and somnolence have been reported during treatment with \nthe components of Eviplera (see section 4.8).  This should be considered when assessing a patient\u2019s \nability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil has been studied as the \ncomponent products in treatment-na\u00efve patients (Phase III studies C209 and C215).  The single-tablet \nregimen (STR), Eviplera, has been studied in virologically suppressed patients who switched from a \nregimen containing a ritonavir-boosted PI (Phase III study GS-US-264-0106) or from \nefavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (Phase IIb study GS-US-264-0111).  In treatment-na\u00efve \npatients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to \nrilpivirine hydrochloride and emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil were nausea (9%), dizziness (8%), \nabnormal dreams (8%), headache (6%), diarrhoea (5%) and insomnia (5%) (pooled data from the \nPhase III clinical studies C209 and C215, see section 5.1).  In virologically suppressed patients \nswitching to Eviplera, the most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably \nrelated to Eviplera were fatigue (3%), diarrhoea (3%), nausea (2%) and insomnia (2%) (48 week data \nfrom the Phase III study GS-US-264-0106).  The safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil in these studies was consistent with the previous experience with these agents when each \nwas administered with other antiretroviral agents. \n \nIn patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, renal failure and \nuncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) sometimes leading to \nbone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported.  Monitoring of renal \nfunction is recommended for patients receiving Eviplera (see section 4.4). \n \nDiscontinuation of Eviplera therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with \nsevere acute exacerbations of hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with the components of \nEviplera from clinical study and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 2, below, by body \nsystem organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions to Eviplera based on clinical study and \npost-marketing experience with Eviplera and its individual components \n \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon: neutropenia\n1, decreased white blood cell count2, decreased haemoglobin2, decreased \n\nplatelet count2 \nUncommon: anaemia1, 4 \nImmune system disorders \nCommon: allergic reaction1 \nUncommon: immune reactivation syndrome \n\n\n\n23 \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common: increased total cholesterol (fasted)\n2, increased LDL-cholesterol (fasted)2, \n\nhypophosphataemia3, 5 \nCommon: hypertriglyceridaemia1, 2, hyperglycaemia1, decreased appetite2 \nUncommon: hypokalaemia3, 5 \nRare: lactic acidosis3 \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery common: insomnia1, 2 \nCommon: depression2, depressed mood2, sleep disorders2, abnormal dreams1, 2  \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache1, 2, 3, dizziness1, 2, 3 \nCommon: somnolence2 \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: increased pancreatic amylase2, vomiting1, 2, 3, diarrhoea1, 3, nausea1, 2, 3  \n\nCommon: \nelevated amylase including elevated pancreatic amylase1, elevated serum lipase1, 2, \nabdominal pain1, 2, 3, abdominal discomfort2, abdominal distension3, dyspepsia1, \nflatulence3, dry mouth2 \n\nUncommon: pancreatitis3 \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: increased transaminases (AST and/or ALT)1, 2, 3 \nCommon: increased bilirubin1, 2 \nRare: hepatitis3, hepatic steatosis3  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common: rash1, 2, 3 \n\nCommon: vesiculobullous rash\n1, pustular rash1, urticaria1, skin discolouration (increased \n\npigmentation)1, 4, maculopapular rash1, pruritus1 \nUncommon: angioedema1, 3, 6, severe skin reactions with systemic symptoms7 \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: elevated creatine kinase1 \nUncommon: rhabdomyolysis3, 5, muscular weakness3, 5 \n\nRare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures)\n3, 5, 8, \n\nmyopathy3, 5 \nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nUncommon: proximal renal tubulopathy including Fanconi syndrome\n3, increased creatinine3, \n\nproteinuria3 \n\nRare: renal failure (acute and chronic)\n3, acute tubular necrosis3, nephritis (including acute \n\ninterstitial nephritis)3, 8, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus3 \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: asthenia1, 3 \nCommon: pain1, fatigue2 \n\n1 Adverse reaction identified for emtricitabine. \n2 Adverse reaction identified for rilpivirine hydrochloride. \n3 Adverse reaction identified for tenofovir disoproxil. \n4 Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine was \n\nadministered to paediatric patients (see section 4.8, Paediatric population). \n5 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \n\nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n6 This was a rare adverse reaction for tenofovir disoproxil.  It was also identified as an adverse reaction for emtricitabine \n\nthrough post-marketing surveillance but was not observed in randomised controlled clinical studies in adults or paediatric \nHIV clinical studies of emtricitabine.  The frequency category of uncommon was estimated from a statistical calculation \nbased on the total number of patients exposed to emtricitabine in these clinical studies (n = 1,563). \n\n7 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for Eviplera (fixed-dose combination) but not \nobserved in randomised controlled clinical studies for Eviplera.  The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to Eviplera or all of its components in randomised controlled \nclinical studies (n = 1,261).  See section 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions. \n\n8 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for tenofovir disoproxil but not observed in \nrandomised controlled clinical studies or the expanded access program for tenofovir disoproxil.  The frequency category \nwas estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in \nrandomised controlled clinical studies and the expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLipids \nAt 96 weeks in the pooled Phase III C209 and C215 studies of treatment-na\u00efve patients, in the \nrilpivirine arm the mean change from baseline in total cholesterol (fasted) was 5 mg/dL, in \nhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (fasted) 4 mg/dL, in low density lipoprotein \n(LDL)-cholesterol (fasted) 1 mg/dL, and in triglycerides (fasted) -7 mg/dL.  At 48 weeks in Phase III \nstudy GS-US-264-0106 of virologically suppressed patients switching to Eviplera from a regimen \ncontaining a ritonavir-boosted PI, the mean change from baseline in total cholesterol (fasted) \nwas -24 mg/dL, in HDL-cholesterol (fasted) -2 mg/dL, in LDL-cholesterol (fasted) -16 mg/dL, and in \ntriglycerides (fasted) -64 mg/dL. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nRenal impairment \nAs Eviplera may cause renal damage, monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.8, Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved \nafter tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines in CrCl did not \ncompletely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal impairment \n(such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients receiving \nconcomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete recovery of \nrenal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nInteraction with didanosine \nCo-administration of Eviplera and didanosine is not recommended as it results in a 40-60% increase in \nsystemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.5).  Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nSevere skin reactions \nSevere skin reactions with systemic symptoms have been reported during post-marketing experience \nwith Eviplera, including rashes accompanied by fever, blisters, conjunctivitis, angioedema, elevated \nliver function tests, and/or eosinophilia (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInsufficient safety data are available for children under the age of 18 years.  Eviplera is not \nrecommended in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nWhen emtricitabine (one of the components of Eviplera) was administered to paediatric patients, the \nfollowing adverse reactions were observed more frequently in addition to the adverse reactions \nreported in adults: anaemia was common (9.5%) and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was \n\n\n\n25 \n\nvery common (31.8%) in paediatric patients (see section 4.8, Tabulated summary of adverse \nreactions). \n \nOther special populations \n \nElderly \nEviplera has not been studied in patients over the age of 65 years.  Elderly patients are more likely to \nhave decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients \nwith Eviplera (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nSince tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended \nin any patient with renal impairment treated with Eviplera (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients \nThe adverse reaction profile of emtricitabine, rilpivirine hydrochloride and tenofovir disoproxil in \npatients co-infected with HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV was similar to that observed in patients infected with \nHIV without co-infection.  However, as would be expected in this patient population, elevations in \nAST and ALT occurred more frequently than in the general HIV infected population. \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HIV infected patients co-infected with HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatitis have \noccurred after discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAn increased risk of adverse reactions associated with Eviplera and its individual components may be \nseen in the event of an overdose. \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and \nstandard supportive treatment applied as necessary including observation of the clinical status of the \npatient and monitoring of vital signs and ECG (QT interval). \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Eviplera.  Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and \napproximately 10% of the tenofovir dose can be removed by haemodialysis.  It is not known whether \nemtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.  Since rilpivirine is highly protein \nbound, dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of the active substance.  Further \nmanagement should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, \nwhere available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations.  ATC code: J05AR08. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n26 \n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of cytidine.  Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to \ntenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate.  Both \nemtricitabine and tenofovir have activity that is specific to HIV-1, HIV-2 and, HBV. \n \nRilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1.  Rilpivirine activity is mediated by \nnon-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate \nand tenofovir diphosphate, respectively.  In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and \ntenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells.  Emtricitabine triphosphate \nand tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 RT, resulting in DNA chain termination. \n \nBoth emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA \npolymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo.  Rilpivirine \ndoes not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2 and mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe triple combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir demonstrated synergistic antiviral \nactivity in cell culture. \n \nThe antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI-CCR5 cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  The \n50% effective concentration (EC50) values for emtricitabine were in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 \u00b5M. \n \nEmtricitabine displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 subtype A, B, C, D, E, F, and G \n(EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 0.075 \u00b5M) and showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 \n(EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 1.5 \u00b5M). \n \nIn combination studies of emtricitabine with NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, \ntenofovir, and zidovudine), NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine, and rilpivirine), and PIs \n(amprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir), additive to synergistic effects were observed. \n \nRilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected \nT-cell line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/mL).  Although rilpivirine \ndemonstrated limited in vitro activity against HIV-2 with EC50 values ranging from 2,510 to \n10,830 nM (920 to 3,970 ng/mL), treatment of HIV-2 infection with rilpivirine hydrochloride is not \nrecommended in the absence of clinical data. \n \nRilpivirine also demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (subtype A, B, \nC, D, F, G, H) primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 0.07 to 1.01 nM (0.03 to 0.37 ng/mL) \nand group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 2.88 to 8.45 nM (1.06 to 3.10 ng/mL). \n \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes.  \nThe EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04 to 8.5 \u00b5M. \n \nTenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 subtype A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O \n(EC50 values ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 \u00b5M) and strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values \nranged from 1.6 to 5.5 \u00b5M). \n \nIn combination studies of tenofovir with NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, \nstavudine, and zidovudine), NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine, and rilpivirine), and PIs \n(amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir), additive to synergistic effects were \nobserved. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nResistance \n \nConsidering all of the available in vitro data and data generated in previously untreated patients, the \nfollowing resistance-associated mutations in HIV-1 RT, when present at baseline, may affect the \nactivity of Eviplera: K65R, K70E, K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, E138R, V179L, \nY181C, Y181I, Y181V, M184I, M184V, Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I, M230L and the \ncombination of L100I and K103N. \n \nA negative impact by NNRTI mutations other than those listed above (e.g. mutations K103N or L100I \nas single mutations) cannot be excluded, since this was not studied in vivo in a sufficient number of \npatients. \n \nAs with other antiretroviral medicinal products, resistance testing and/or historical resistance data \nshould guide the use of Eviplera (see section 4.4). \n \nIn cell culture \nResistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due \nto the development of the M184V or M184I substitution in RT with emtricitabine, or the K65R \nsubstitution in RT with tenofovir.  In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 RT has been selected by \ntenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, tenofovir and \nlamivudine.  No other pathways of resistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir have been identified.  \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine and zidovudine.  The K65R \nmutation can also be selected by abacavir or didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these \nagents plus to lamivudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.  Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in \npatients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutation.  The K65R, M184V, and K65R+M184V mutants \nof HIV-1 remain fully susceptible to rilpivirine. \n \nRilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different \norigins and subtypes as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1.  The most commonly observed resistance-\nassociated mutations that emerged included L100I, K101E, V108I, E138K, V179F, Y181C, H221Y, \nF227C and M230I. \n \nIn treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected patients \nFor the resistance analyses, a broader definition of virologic failure was used than in the primary \nefficacy analysis.  In the cumulative week 96 pooled resistance analysis for patients receiving \nrilpivirine in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, a greater risk of virologic failure for \npatients in the rilpivirine arm was observed within the first 48 weeks of these studies (11.5% in the \nrilpivirine arm and 4.2% in the efavirenz arm) while low rates of virologic failure, similar between the \ntreatment arms, were observed from the week 48 to week 96 analysis (15 patients or 2.7% in the \nrilpivirine arm and 14 patients or 2.6% in the efavirenz arm).  Of these virologic failures 5/15 \n(rilpivirine) and 5/14 (efavirenz) were in patients with a baseline viral load of \u2264 100,000 copies/mL. \n \nIn the week 96 pooled resistance analysis for patients receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil + \nrilpivirine hydrochloride in the Phase III clinical studies C209 and C215, there were 78 virologic \nfailure patients with genotypic resistance information available for 71 of those patients.  In this \nanalysis, the NNRTI resistance-associated mutations that developed most commonly in these patients \nwere: V90I, K101E, E138K/Q, V179I, Y181C, V189I, H221Y and F227C.  The most common \nmutations were the same in the week 48 and week 96 analyses.  In the studies, the presence of the \nmutations V90I and V189I at baseline did not affect the response.  The E138K substitution emerged \nmost frequently during rilpivirine treatment, commonly in combination with the M184I substitution.  \n52% of patients with virologic failure in the rilpivirine arm developed concomitant NNRTI and NRTI \nmutations.  The mutations associated with NRTI resistance that developed in 3 or more patients were: \nK65R, K70E, M184V/I and K219E during the treatment period. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThrough week 96, fewer patients in the rilpivirine arm with baseline viral load \u2264 100,000 copies/mL \nhad emerging resistance-associated substitutions and/or phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine (7/288) \nthan patients with baseline viral load > 100,000 copies/mL (30/262).  Among those patients who \ndeveloped resistance to rilpivirine, 4/7 patients with baseline viral load \u2264 100,000 copies/mL and \n28/30 patients with baseline viral load > 100,000 copies/mL had cross-resistance to other NNRTIs. \n \nIn virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients \nStudy GS-US-264-0106 \nOf the 469 Eviplera-treated patients [317 patients who switched to Eviplera at baseline (Eviplera arm) \nand 152 patients who switched at week 24 (Delayed Switch arm)], a total of 7 patients were analysed \nfor resistance development and all had genotypic and phenotypic data available.  Through week 24, \ntwo patients who switched to Eviplera at baseline (2 of 317 patients, 0.6%) and one patient who \nmaintained their ritonavir-boosted PI-based regimen [Stayed on Baseline Regimen (SBR) arm] (1 of \n159 patients, 0.6%) developed genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to study drugs.  After week 24, \nthe HIV-1 from 2 additional patients in the Eviplera arm developed resistance by week 48 (total of 4 \nof 469 patients, 0.9%).  The remaining 3 Eviplera-treated patients did not have emergent resistance. \n \nThe most common emergent resistance mutations in Eviplera-treated patients were M184V/I and \nE138K in RT.  All patients remained susceptible to tenofovir.  Of the 24 patients treated with Eviplera \nwho had the NNRTI-associated K103N substitution pre-existing at baseline in their HIV-1, 17 of \n18 patients in the Eviplera arm and 5 of 6 patients in the SBR arm maintained virologic suppression \nafter switching to Eviplera through 48 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively.  One patient \nwith pre-existing K103N at baseline had virologic failure with additional emergent resistance by \nweek 48. \n \nStudy GS-US-264-0111 \nThrough week 48, no emergent resistance developed in the 2 patients who failed virologically among \npatients who switched to Eviplera from efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (0 of 49 patients). \n \nCross-resistance \n \nNo significant cross-resistance has been demonstrated between rilpivirine-resistant HIV-1 variants and \nemtricitabine or tenofovir, or between emtricitabine- or tenofovir-resistant variants and rilpivirine. \n \nIn cell culture \nEmtricitabine \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I substitution were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine. \n \nViruses harbouring substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to stavudine and \nzidovudine-thymidine analogue-associated mutations-TAMs (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, \nK219Q/E), or didanosine (L74V) remained sensitive to emtricitabine.  HIV-1 containing the K103N \nsubstitution or other substitutions associated with resistance to rilpivirine and other NNRTIs was \nsusceptible to emtricitabine. \n \nRilpivirine hydrochloride \nIn a panel of 67 HIV-1 recombinant laboratory strains with one resistance-associated mutation at RT \npositions associated with NNRTI resistance, including the most commonly found K103N and Y181C, \nrilpivirine showed antiviral activity against 64 (96%) of these strains.  The single resistance-associated \nmutations associated with a loss of susceptibility to rilpivirine were: K101P and Y181V/I.  The \nK103N substitution alone did not result in reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine, but the combination of \nK103N and L100I resulted in a 7-fold reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine.  In another study, the \nY188L substitution resulted in a reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine of 9-fold for clinical isolates and \n6-fold for site-directed mutants. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTenofovir disoproxil \nThe K65R and also the K70E substitution result in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, \nlamivudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir, but retain sensitivity to zidovudine. \n \nPatients with HIV-1 expressing three or more TAMs that included either the M41L or L210W RT \nsubstitution showed reduced response to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nVirologic response to tenofovir disoproxil was not reduced in patients with HIV-1 that expressed the \nabacavir/emtricitabine/lamivudine resistance-associated M184V substitution. \n \nHIV-1 containing the K103N, Y181C, or rilpivirine-associated substitutions with resistance to \nNNRTIs were susceptible to tenofovir. \n \nIn treatment-na\u00efve patients \nResistance outcomes, including cross-resistance to other NNRTIs, in patients receiving rilpivirine \nhydrochloride in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in Phase III studies (C209 and \nC215 pooled data) and experiencing virological failure, are shown in Table 3 below. \n \nTable 3: Phenotypic resistance and cross-resistance outcomes from studies C209 and C215 \n(pooled data) for patients receiving rilpivirine hydrochloride in combination with \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil at week 96 (based on resistance analysis) \n \n\n In patients with \nphenotypic data \n(n = 66) \n\nIn patients with \nBL VL1 \u2264 100,000 \ncopies/mL (n = 22) \n\nIn patients with BL \nVL1 > 100,000 \ncopies/mL (n = 44) \n\nResistance to rilpivirine2 \nCross-resistance3 to \n          etravirine \n          efavirenz \n          nevirapine \n\n31/66 \n \n\n28/31 \n27/31 \n13/31 \n\n4/22 \n \n\n3/4 \n3/4 \n1/4 \n\n27/44 \n \n\n25/27 \n24/27 \n12/27 \n\nResistance to \nemtricitabine/lamivudine \n(M184I/V) \n\n40/66 9/22 31/44 \n\nResistance to tenofovir \n(K65R) \n\n2/66 0/22 2/44 \n\n1 BL VL = Baseline viral load. \n2 Phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine (> 3.7-fold change compared to control). \n3 Phenotypic resistance (Antivirogram). \n \nIn virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients \nIn study GS-US-264-0106, 4 of the 469 patients who switched from a ritonavir-PI-based regimen to \nEviplera had HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to at least one component of Eviplera through \nweek 48.  De novo resistance to emtricitabine/lamivudine was seen in 4 cases, and also to rilpivirine in \n2 cases, with a consequent cross-resistance to efavirenz (2/2), nevirapine (2/2) and etravirine (1/2). \n \nEffects on electrocardiogram \n \nThe effect of rilpivirine hydrochloride at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily on the \nQTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) \ncontrolled crossover study in 60 healthy adults, with 13 measurements over 24 hours at steady-state.  \nRilpivirine hydrochloride at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a \nclinically relevant effect on QTc. \n \nWhen supratherapeutic doses of 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily of rilpivirine hydrochloride \nwere studied in healthy adults, the maximum mean time-matched (95% upper confidence bound) \ndifferences in QTcF interval from placebo after baseline correction were 10.7 (15.3) and \n23.3 (28.4) ms, respectively.  Steady-state administration of rilpivirine hydrochloride 75 mg once daily \nand 300 mg once daily resulted in a mean Cmax approximately 2.6-fold and 6.7-fold, respectively, \n\n\n\n30 \n\nhigher than the mean steady-state Cmax observed with the recommended 25 mg once daily dose of \nrilpivirine hydrochloride. \n \nClinical experience \n \nTreatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected patients \nThe efficacy of Eviplera is based on the analyses of 96 week data from two randomised, double-blind, \ncontrolled studies C209 and C215.  Antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected patients were \nenrolled (n = 1,368) who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA \u2265 5,000 copies/mL and were screened for \nsusceptibility to N(t)RTI and for absence of specific NNRTI resistance-associated mutations.  The \nstudies are identical in design with the exception of the background regimen (BR).  Patients were \nrandomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rilpivirine hydrochloride 25 mg (n = 686) once daily or \nefavirenz 600 mg (n = 682) once daily in addition to a BR.  In study C209 (n = 690), the BR was \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil.  In study C215 (n = 678), the BR consisted of 2 investigator \nselected N(t)RTIs: emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (60%, n = 406) or lamivudine/zidovudine (30%, \nn = 204) or abacavir plus lamivudine (10%, n = 68). \n \nIn the pooled analysis for C209 and C215 of patients who received a background regimen of \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between \nthe rilpivirine and efavirenz arm.

Patients had to have previously only received efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil as their first antiretroviral regimen for at least three months, and wished to switch regimens \ndue to efavirenz intolerance.  Patients had to be stably suppressed for at least 8 weeks prior to study \nentry, have no current or past history of resistance to any of the three components of Eviplera, and \nhave HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at screening.  Patients were switched from \nefavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to Eviplera without a washout period.  Among 49 patients \nwho received at least one dose of Eviplera, 100% of patients remained suppressed \n(HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) at week 12 and week 24.  At week 48, 94% (46/49) of patients \nremained suppressed, and 4% (2/49) were considered virologic failures (HIV-1 RNA \u2265 50 copies/mL).  \nOne patient (2%) did not have data available in the week 48 window; study drug was discontinued due \nto a protocol violation (i.e. reason other than AE or death) and the last available HIV-1 RNA was \n< 50 copies/mL. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nEviplera in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV-1 (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nPregnancy \n \nRilpivirine (taken as Eviplera in 16 of 19 patients and another background regimen in 3 of 19 patients) \nwas evaluated in study TMC114HIV3015 in pregnant women during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, and \npostpartum.  The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that total exposure (AUC) to rilpivirine as a part \nof an antiretroviral regimen was approximately 30% lower during pregnancy compared with \npostpartum (6-12 weeks).  The virologic response was generally preserved throughout the study: of the \n12 patients that completed the study, 10 patients were suppressed at the end of the study; in the other \n2 patients an increase in viral load was observed only postpartum, for at least 1 patient due to \nsuspected suboptimal adherence.  No mother to child transmission occurred in all 10 infants born to \nthe mothers who completed the study and for whom the HIV status was available.  Rilpivirine was \nwell tolerated during pregnancy and postpartum.  There were no new safety findings compared with \nthe known safety profile of rilpivirine in HIV-1 infected adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe bioequivalence of one Eviplera film-coated tablet with one emtricitabine 200 mg hard capsule, \none rilpivirine (as hydrochloride) 25 mg film-coated tablet and one tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg \nfilm-coated tablet was established following single dose administration to fed, healthy subjects.  \nFollowing oral administration of Eviplera with food emtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed \nwith maximum plasma concentrations occurring within 2.5 hours post-dose.  Maximum tenofovir \nconcentrations are observed in plasma within 2 hours and maximum plasma concentrations of \nrilpivirine are generally achieved within 4-5 hours.  Following oral administration of tenofovir \ndisoproxil to HIV infected patients, tenofovir disoproxil is rapidly absorbed and converted to \ntenofovir.  The absolute bioavailability of emtricitabine from 200 mg hard capsules was estimated to \nbe 93%.  The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil tablets in fasted patients was \napproximately 25%.  The absolute bioavailability of rilpivirine is unknown.  The administration of \nEviplera to healthy adult subjects with either a light meal (390 kcal) or a standard meal (540 kcal) \nresulted in increased exposures of rilpivirine and tenofovir relative to fasting conditions.  The Cmax and \nAUC of rilpivirine increased by 34% and 9% (light meal) and 26% and 16% (standard meal), \nrespectively.  The Cmax and AUC for tenofovir increased by 12% and 28% (light meal) and 32% and \n38% (standard meal), respectively.  Emtricitabine exposures were not affected by food.  Eviplera must \nbe administered with food to ensure optimal absorption (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous administration the volume of distribution of the single components \nemtricitabine and tenofovir was approximately 1,400 mL/kg and 800 mL/kg, respectively.  After oral \nadministration of the single components emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine and \ntenofovir are widely distributed throughout the body.  In vitro binding of emtricitabine to human \nplasma proteins was < 4% and independent of concentration over the range of 0.02 to 200 \u00b5g/mL.  \nIn vitro binding of rilpivirine to human plasma proteins is approximately 99.7%, primarily to albumin.  \nIn vitro binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was less than 0.7% and 7.2%, respectively, \nover the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 \u00b5g/mL. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThere is limited metabolism of emtricitabine.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes \noxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3\u2019-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and \nconjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2\u2019-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose).  In vitro \nexperiments indicate that rilpivirine hydrochloride primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism \nmediated by the CYP3A system.  In vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor \ntenofovir are substrates for the CYP450 enzymes.  Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited \nin vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug \n\n\n\n35 \n\nbiotransformation.  Also, emtricitabine did not inhibit uridine-5\u2019-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the \nenzyme responsible for glucuronidation. \n \nElimination \n \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 mL/min.  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately \n10 hours. \n \nThe terminal elimination half-life of rilpivirine is approximately 45 hours.  After single dose oral \nadministration of [14C]-rilpivirine, on average 85% and 6.1% of the radioactivity could be retrieved in \nfaeces and urine, respectively.  In faeces, unchanged rilpivirine accounted for on average 25% of the \nadministered dose.  Only trace amounts of unchanged rilpivirine (< 1% of dose) were detected in \nurine. \n \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \n(human organic anion transporter 1 [hOAT1]) with approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted \nunchanged in urine following intravenous administration.  The apparent clearance of tenofovir \naveraged approximately 307 mL/min.  Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately \n210 mL/min, which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.  This indicates that active tubular \nsecretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir.  Following oral administration, the \nelimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that rilpivirine pharmacokinetics \nis not different across the age range (18 to 78 years) evaluated, with only 2 patients aged 65 years of \nage or older. \n \nGender \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar in male and female patients.  No clinically \nrelevant differences in pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine have been observed between men and women. \n \nEthnicity \nNo clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to ethnicity have been identified. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn general, the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine in infants, children and adolescents (aged 4 months \nup to 18 years) is similar to those seen in adults.  The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil in children and adolescents are under investigation.  Dosing recommendations for paediatric \npatients cannot be made due to insufficient data (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nLimited data from clinical studies support once daily dosing of Eviplera in patients with mild renal \nimpairment (CrCl 50-80 mL/min).  However, long-term safety data for the emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil components of Eviplera have not been evaluated in patients with mild renal impairment.  \nTherefore, in patients with mild renal impairment Eviplera should only be used if the potential benefits \nof treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nEviplera is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl \n< 50 mL/min).  Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require a dose interval adjustment \nof emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nPharmacokinetic parameters were mainly determined following administration of single doses of \nemtricitabine 200 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected patients with varying \ndegrees of renal impairment.  The degree of renal impairment was defined according to baseline CrCl \n(normal renal function when CrCl > 80 mL/min; mild impairment with CrCl = 50-79 mL/min; \nmoderate impairment with CrCl = 30-49 mL/min and severe impairment with CrCl = 10-29 mL/min). \n \nThe mean (%CV) emtricitabine drug exposure increased from 12 (25%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL in patients with \nnormal renal function, to 20 (6%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, 25 (23%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL and 34 (6%) \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, in patients with \nmild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. \n \nThe mean (%CV) tenofovir drug exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng\u2022h/mL in patients with \nnormal renal function, to 3,064 (30%) ng\u2022h/mL, 6,009 (42%) ng\u2022h/mL and 15,985 (45%) ng\u2022h/mL, in \npatients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. \n \nIn patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, between dialysis drug \nexposures substantially increased over 72 hours to 53 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL (19%) of emtricitabine, and over \n48 hours to 42,857 ng\u2022h/mL (29%) of tenofovir. \n \nA small clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics of \ntenofovir disoproxil in combination with emtricitabine in HIV infected patients with renal impairment.  \nA subgroup of patients with baseline CrCl between 50 and 60 mL/min, receiving once daily dosing, \nhad a 2- to 4-fold increase in tenofovir exposure and worsening renal function. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine has not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency.  Renal \nelimination of rilpivirine is negligible.  In patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD, plasma \nconcentrations may be increased due to alteration of drug absorption, distribution and/or metabolism \nsecondary to renal dysfunction.  As rilpivirine is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it \nwill be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see section 4.9). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Eviplera is suggested but caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment.  Eviplera has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPT Score C).  \nTherefore, Eviplera is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine has not been studied in patients with varying degrees of hepatic \ninsufficiency. \n \nRilpivirine hydrochloride is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  In a study comparing \n8 patients with mild hepatic impairment (CPT Score A) to 8 matched controls and 8 patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment (CPT Score B) to 8 matched controls, the multiple dose exposure of \nrilpivirine was 47% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 5% higher in patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment.  Rilpivirine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (CPT Score C) (see section 4.2).  However, it may not be excluded that the \npharmacologically active, unbound, rilpivirine exposure is significantly increased in moderate \nimpairment. \n \nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV infected subjects with \nvarying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to CPT classification.  Tenofovir \npharmacokinetics was not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic impairment suggesting that no \ndose adjustment is required in these subjects.  The mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax and AUC0-\u221e values \nwere 223 (34.8%) ng/mL and 2,050 (50.8%) ng\u2022h/mL, respectively, in normal subjects compared with \n289 (46.0%) ng/mL and 2,310 (43.5%) ng\u2022h/mL in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and \n305 (24.8%) ng/mL and 2,740 (44.0%) ng\u2022h/mL in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \nIn general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected patients was similar to those in healthy \nsubjects and in HIV infected patients. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection had no \nclinically relevant effect on the exposure to rilpivirine. \n \nSwitching from an efavirenz-based regimen \nThe efficacy data from study GS-US-264-0111 (see section 5.1) indicates that the brief period of lower \nrilpivirine exposure does not impact antiviral efficacy of Eviplera.  Due to the decline in efavirenz \nplasma levels, the inductive effect decreased and rilpivirine concentrations started to normalise.  \nDuring the time period of declining efavirenz plasma levels and increasing rilpivirine plasma levels \nafter switching, none of the patients had efavirenz or rilpivirine levels below their respective IC90 \nlevels at the same time.  No dose adjustment is required following the switch from an \nefavirenz-containing regimen. \n \nPregnancy and postpartum \nAfter taking rilpivirine 25 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, the total exposure of \nrilpivirine was lower during pregnancy (similar for the 2nd and 3rd trimester) compared with \npostpartum.  The decrease in the unbound free fraction of rilpivirine exposure (i.e. active) during \npregnancy compared to postpartum was less pronounced than for total exposure of rilpivirine. \n \nIn women receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, mean intra-\nindividual values for total rilpivirine Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 21%, 29% and 35% lower, \nrespectively, as compared to postpartum; during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin \nvalues were 20%, 31% and 42% lower, respectively, as compared to postpartum. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \nNon-clinical data on rilpivirine hydrochloride reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of \nsafety pharmacology, drug disposition, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \nreproduction and development.  Liver toxicity associated with liver enzyme induction was observed in \nrodents.  In dogs cholestasis-like effects were noted. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies with rilpivirine in mice and rats revealed tumorigenic potential specific for \nthese species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans. \n \nStudies in animals have shown limited placenta passage of rilpivirine.  It is not known whether \nplacental transfer of rilpivirine occurs in pregnant women.  There was no teratogenicity with \nrilpivirine in rats and rabbits. \n \nNon-clinical data on tenofovir disoproxil reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional \nstudies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction and \ndevelopment.  Findings in repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels \ngreater than or equal to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use included \nkidney and bone changes and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity was \ndiagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced BMD (rats and dogs). \n \nGenotoxicity and repeated dose toxicity studies of one month or less with the combination of \nemtricitabine and tenofovir disproxil found no exacerbation of toxicological effects compared to \nstudies with the separate components. \n \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Eviplera is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Eviplera \n3. How to take Eviplera \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Eviplera \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Eviplera is and what it is used for \n \nEviplera contains three active substances that are used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n(HIV) infection: \n \n\u2022 Emtricitabine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). \n\u2022 Rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). \n\u2022 Tenofovir disoproxil, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). \n \nEach of these active substances, also known as antiretroviral medicines, works by interfering with an \nenzyme (a protein called \u2018reverse transcriptase\u2019) that is essential for the virus to multiply. \n \nEviplera reduces the amount of HIV in your body.  This, will improve your immune system and \nreduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \nEviplera is a treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults aged \n18 years and over. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Eviplera \n \nDo not take Eviplera \n \n\u2022 If you are allergic to emtricitabine, rilpivirine, tenofovir disoproxil, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n \n\uf0e0 If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\u2022 If you are currently taking any of the following medicines \n\n\u2022 carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines to treat \nepilepsy and prevent seizures) \n\n\u2022 rifampicin and rifapentine (used to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis) \n\n\n\n48 \n\n\u2022 omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and esomeprazole (proton \npump inhibitors that are medicines used to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, heartburn, \nacid reflux disease) \n\n\u2022 dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation and suppress the immune \nsystem) when taken by mouth or injected (except as a single dose treatment) \n\n\u2022 products that contain St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal remedy used \nfor depression and anxiety) \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Eviplera. \n \n\u2022 You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \n\nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Eviplera you may still \ndevelop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n\n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you had kidney disease, or if tests have shown kidney problems.  Eviplera \n\nmay affect your kidneys.  Before and during treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to \nmeasure kidney function.  Eviplera is not recommended if you have moderate to severe kidney \ndisease. \n \nEviplera is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other \nmedicines and Eviplera).  If this is unavoidable, your doctor will monitor your kidney function \nonce a week. \n\n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  HIV patients \n\nwith liver disease (including chronic hepatitis B or C), who are treated with antiretrovirals, have \na higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B, your \ndoctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you.  Two of the active substances \nin Eviplera (tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine) show some activity against hepatitis B virus.  \nIf you have a history of liver disease, or chronic hepatitis B infection, your doctor may conduct \nblood tests in order to monitor liver function. \n\n \nIf you have hepatitis B infection, liver problems may become worse after you stop taking \nEviplera.  It is important not to stop taking Eviplera without talking to your doctor: see \nsection 3, Do not stop taking Eviplera. \n\n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor immediately and stop taking Eviplera if you develop a skin rash with the \n\nfollowing symptoms: fever, blisters, redness in your eyes and swelling of your face, mouth \nor body.  This may become severe or potentially life-threatening. \n\n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you are over 65 years of age.  Not enough patients over the age of 65 \n\nhave been studied.  If you are over 65 years of age and are prescribed Eviplera, your doctor will \nmonitor you carefully. \n\n \nWhile you take Eviplera \nOnce you start taking Eviplera, look out for: \n \n\u2022 any signs of inflammation or infection \n\u2022 bone problems \n \n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Eviplera \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  This includes medicines and herbal medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n \n\u2022 Any other medicines containing: \n\n\u2022 emtricitabine \n\u2022 rilpivirine \n\u2022 tenofovir disoproxil \n\u2022 tenofovir alafenamide \n\u2022 any other antiviral medicines that contain lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil \n\n \nEviplera may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Eviplera or other medicines in \nyour blood may be affected.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any \nside effects worse.  In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood \nlevels. \n \n\u2022 Medicines that may damage your kidneys, examples include: \n\n\u2022 aminoglycosides (such as streptomycin, neomycin and gentamicin), vancomycin (for \nbacterial infections) \n\n\u2022 foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir (for viral infections) \n\u2022 amphotericin B, pentamidine (for fungal infections) \n\u2022 interleukin-2, also called aldesleukin (to treat cancer) \n\u2022 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) \n\n \n\u2022 Medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Eviplera with other antiviral \n\nmedicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may \nreduce CD4+ cell counts.  Inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in \nthe blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported rarely when medicines \ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your doctor will carefully \nconsider whether to treat you with other medicines used for treating HIV infection (see Other \nmedicines used for HIV infection). \n\n \n\u2022 Other medicines used for HIV infection: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors \n\n(NNRTIs).  Eviplera contains an NNRTI (rilpivirine) and so Eviplera is not to be combined with \nother medicines of this type.  Your doctor will discuss a different medicine if required. \n\n \n\u2022 Rifabutin, a medicine to treat some bacterial infections.  This medicine can decrease the \n\namount of rilpivirine (a component of Eviplera) in your blood.  Your doctor may need to give \nyou an additional dose of rilpivirine to treat your HIV infection (see section 3, How to take \nEviplera). \n\n \n\u2022 Antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis containing: \n\n\u2022 clarithromycin \n\u2022 erythromycin \nThese medicines can increase the amount of rilpivirine (a component of Eviplera) in your blood.  \nYour doctor may need to change the dose of the antibiotic or give you a different antibiotic. \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n\u2022 Medicines for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux such as: \n\u2022 antacids (aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate) \n\u2022 H2-antagonists (famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine) \nThese medicines can decrease the amount of rilpivirine (a component of Eviplera) in your \nblood.  If you are taking one of these medicines your doctor will either give you a different \nmedicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux, or recommend how and when you take \nthat medicine. \n\n \n\u2022 If you are taking an antacid (such as medicines containing magnesium or potassium), take it \n\nat least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after Eviplera (see section 3, How to take Eviplera). \n \n\u2022 If you are taking an H2-antagonist (also used to treat stomach acid or acid reflux disease), \n\ntake it at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after Eviplera.  H2-antagonists can only be \ntaken once a day if you take Eviplera.  H2-antagonists should not be taken in a twice a day \nregimen.  Talk to your doctor about an alternative regimen (see section 3, How to take \nEviplera). \n\n \n\u2022 Methadone, a medicine used to treat opiate addiction, as your doctor may need to change your \n\nmethadone dose. \n \n\u2022 Dabigatran etexilate, a medicine used to treat heart conditions, as your doctor may need to \n\nmonitor the levels of this medicine in your blood. \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines.  Do not stop your treatment without \n\ncontacting your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n\u2022 Women must not get pregnant while taking Eviplera. \n\u2022 Use effective contraception while taking Eviplera. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant.  \n\nPregnant women should not take Eviplera unless you and your doctor decide it is clearly \nneeded.  Your doctor will discuss the potential benefits and risks of taking Eviplera to you and \nyour child. \n\n\u2022 If you have taken Eviplera during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests \nand other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers \ntook NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk \nof side effects. \n\n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Eviplera: \n\u2022 This is because the active substances in this medicine pass into human breast milk. \n\u2022 If you are a woman with HIV it is recommended that you do not breast-feed, to avoid passing \n\nthe virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nDo not drive or operate machines if you feel tired, sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicine. \n \nEviplera contains lactose and sunset yellow aluminium lake (E110) \n \n\u2022 If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your \n\ndoctor before taking this medicine. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have an allergy to sunset yellow aluminium lake (E110).  Eviplera \n\ncontains sunset yellow aluminium lake also called \u201cE110\u201d which may cause allergic reactions. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n \n3. How to take Eviplera \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe usual dose is one tablet taken each day by mouth.  The tablet must be taken with food.  This \nis important to get the right levels of active substance in your body.  A nutritional drink alone does not \nreplace food. \n \nSwallow the tablet whole with water. \n \nDo not chew, crush or split the tablet \u2013 if you do it may affect the way the medicine is released into \nyour body. \n \nIf your doctor decides to stop one of the components of Eviplera or change the dose of Eviplera, you \nmay be given emtricitabine, rilpivirine and/or tenofovir disoproxil separately or with other medicines \nfor the treatment of HIV infection. \n \nIf you are taking an antacid such as medicines containing magnesium or potassium.  Take it at least \n2 hours before or at least 4 hours after Eviplera. \n \nIf you are taking an H2-antagonist such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine.  Take it at \nleast 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after Eviplera.  H2-antagonists can only be taken once a day if \nyou take Eviplera.  H2-antagonists should not be taken twice a day.  Talk to your doctor about an \nalternative regimen. \n \nIf you are taking rifabutin.  Your doctor may need to give you an additional dose of rilpivirine.  \nTake the rilpivirine tablet at the same time you take Eviplera.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nIf you take more Eviplera than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Eviplera you may be at increased risk of \nexperiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Eviplera \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Eviplera. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n\u2022 If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take Eviplera, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Always take the tablet with food.  Then take the next dose as usual. \n\u2022 If you notice after 12 hours or more of the time you usually take Eviplera, then do not take \n\nthe missed dose.  Wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 4 hours after taking Eviplera, take another tablet with food.  If you vomit \nmore than 4 hours after taking Eviplera you do not need to take another tablet until your next \nregularly scheduled tablet. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nDo not stop taking Eviplera \n \nDo not stop taking Eviplera without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Eviplera can seriously affect \nyour response to future treatment.  If Eviplera for any reason is stopped, speak to your doctor before \nyou restart taking Eviplera tablets.  Your doctor may consider giving you the components of Eviplera \nseparately if you are having problems or need your dose adjusted. \n \nWhen your supply of Eviplera starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time.  The virus may then become harder to treat. \n \nIf you have HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Eviplera \ntreatment without talking to your doctor first.  Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms \nindicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of \nthe three active substances of Eviplera).  If Eviplera is stopped your doctor may recommend that you \nresume hepatitis B treatment.  You may need blood tests to check how your liver is working for \n4 months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping \ntreatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-\nthreatening. \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nPossible side effects: tell a doctor immediately \n\u2022 Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side \n\neffect of some HIV medicines.  Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women \u2013 particularly if \nthey are overweight, and in people with liver disease.  The following may be signs of lactic \nacidosis: \n\u2022 Deep, rapid breathing \n\u2022 Tiredness or drowsiness \n\u2022 Feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 Stomach pain \n\n\uf0e0 If you think you may have lactic acidosis, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nAny signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and \na history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune system), \nsigns and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV \ntreatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s \nimmune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious \nsymptoms. \n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\uf0e0 If you notice any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nVery common side effects \n(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 Difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n\u2022 Dizziness, headache \n\u2022 Rash \n\u2022 Feeling weak \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 Decreases in phosphate levels in the blood \n\u2022 Increased levels of creatine kinase in the blood that may result in muscle pain and weakness \n\u2022 Increased levels of cholesterol and/or pancreatic amylase in the blood \n\u2022 Increased levels of liver enzymes in the blood \n\uf0e0 If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Decreased appetite \n\u2022 Depression and depressed mood \n\u2022 Tiredness, feeling sleepy (somnolence) \n\u2022 Drowsiness \n\u2022 Pain, stomach pain or discomfort, feeling bloated, dry mouth \n\u2022 Abnormal dreams, sleep disorders \n\u2022 Problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals, wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 Rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), \n\nwhich may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin \nin patches \n\n\u2022 Other allergic reactions, such as wheezing, swelling or feeling light-headed \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 Low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to \n\ninfection) \n\u2022 Low platelet count (a type of blood cell involved in clotting blood) \n\u2022 Decrease in haemoglobin in your blood (low red blood cell count) \n\u2022 Increased fatty acids (triglycerides), bilirubin or sugar in the blood \n\u2022 Pancreas problems \n\uf0e0 If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Anaemia (low red blood cell count) \n\u2022 Pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n\u2022 Breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness \n\u2022 Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n\u2022 Signs or symptoms of inflammation or infection \n\u2022 Severe skin reactions including rash accompanied by fever, swelling and liver problems \n\u2022 Damage to kidney tubule cells \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 Decreases in potassium in the blood \n\u2022 Increases in creatinine in your blood \n\u2022 Changes to your urine \n\uf0e0 If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nRare side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\u2022 Lactic acidosis (see Possible side effects: tell a doctor immediately) \n\u2022 Back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure.

Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Eviplera \n\nmay develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \nsupply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, \ndrinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of \nthe many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n\u2022 Joint stiffness \n\u2022 Joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n\u2022 Difficulty with movement \n\n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

tenofovir disoproxil, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). if this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. if you are currently taking any of the following medicines carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures) rifampicin and rifapentine (used to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis) 48 omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and esomeprazole (proton pump inhibitors that are medicines used to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, heartburn, acid reflux disease) dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation and suppress the immune system) when taken by mouth or injected (except as a single dose treatment) products that contain st. john's wort (hypericum perforatum) (a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety) warnings and precautions you must remain under the care of your doctor while taking eviplera. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. this medicine is not a cure for hiv infection. while taking eviplera you may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with hiv infection. tell your doctor if you had kidney disease, or if tests have shown kidney problems. eviplera may affect your kidneys. before and during treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to measure kidney function. eviplera is not recommended if you have moderate to severe kidney disease. eviplera is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your kidneys (see other medicines and eviplera). if this is unavoidable, your doctor will monitor your kidney function once a week. talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. hiv patients with liver disease (including chronic hepatitis b or c), who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. if you have hepatitis b, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. two of the active substances in eviplera (tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine) show some activity against hepatitis b virus. if you have a history of liver disease, or chronic hepatitis b infection, your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to monitor liver function. if you have hepatitis b infection, liver problems may become worse after you stop taking eviplera. it is important not to stop taking eviplera without talking to your doctor: see section 3, do not stop taking eviplera. tell your doctor immediately and stop taking eviplera if you develop a skin rash with the following symptoms: fever, blisters, redness in your eyes and swelling of your face, mouth or body. this may become severe or potentially life-threatening. talk to your doctor if you are over 65 years of age. not enough patients over the age of 65 have been studied. if you are over 65 years of age and are prescribed eviplera, your doctor will monitor you carefully. while you take eviplera once you start taking eviplera, look out for: any signs of inflammation or infection bone problems if you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. other medicines and eviplera tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this includes medicines and herbal medicines obtained without a prescription. tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: any other medicines containing: emtricitabine rilpivirine tenofovir disoproxil tenofovir alafenamide any other antiviral medicines that contain lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil eviplera may interact with other medicines. as a result, the amounts of eviplera or other medicines in your blood may be affected. this may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. in some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. medicines that may damage your kidneys, examples include: aminoglycosides (such as streptomycin, neomycin and gentamicin), vancomycin (for bacterial infections) foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir (for viral infections) amphotericin b, pentamidine (for fungal infections) interleukin-2, also called aldesleukin (to treat cancer) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids, to relieve bone or muscle pains) medicines containing didanosine (for hiv infection): taking eviplera with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may reduce cd4+ cell counts. inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported rarely when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with other medicines used for treating hiv infection (see other medicines used for hiv infection). other medicines used for hiv infection: non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nnrtis). eviplera contains an nnrti (rilpivirine) and so eviplera is not to be combined with other medicines of this type. your doctor will discuss a different medicine if required. rifabutin, a medicine to treat some bacterial infections. this medicine can decrease the amount of rilpivirine (a component of eviplera) in your blood. your doctor may need to give you an additional dose of rilpivirine to treat your hiv infection (see section 3, how to take eviplera). antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis containing: clarithromycin erythromycin these medicines can increase the amount of rilpivirine (a component of eviplera) in your blood. your doctor may need to change the dose of the antibiotic or give you a different antibiotic. medicines for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux such as: antacids (aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate) h2-antagonists (famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine) these medicines can decrease the amount of rilpivirine (a component of eviplera) in your blood. if you are taking one of these medicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. if you are taking an antacid (such as medicines containing magnesium or potassium), take it at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after eviplera (see section 3, how to take eviplera). if you are taking an h2-antagonist (also used to treat stomach acid or acid reflux disease), take it at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after eviplera. h2-antagonists can only be taken once a day if you take eviplera. h2-antagonists should not be taken in a twice a day regimen. talk to your doctor about an alternative regimen (see section 3, how to take eviplera). methadone, a medicine used to treat opiate addiction, as your doctor may need to change your methadone dose. dabigatran etexilate, a medicine used to treat heart conditions, as your doctor may need to monitor the levels of this medicine in your blood. tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. do not stop your treatment without contacting your doctor. pregnancy and breast-feeding ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. women must not get pregnant while taking eviplera. use effective contraception while taking eviplera. tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. pregnant women should not take eviplera unless you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. your doctor will discuss the potential benefits and risks of taking eviplera to you and your child. if you have taken eviplera during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. in children whose mothers took nrtis during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against hiv outweighed the risk of side effects. do not breast-feed during treatment with eviplera: this is because the active substances in this medicine pass into human breast milk. if you are a woman with hiv it is recommended that you do not breast-feed, to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. driving and using machines do not drive or operate machines if you feel tired, sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicine. eviplera contains lactose and sunset yellow aluminium lake (e110) if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. tell your doctor if you have an allergy to sunset yellow aluminium lake (e110). eviplera contains sunset yellow aluminium lake also called \"e110\" which may cause allergic reactions.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "eviplera", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 13,

"Section_Content": "always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the usual dose is one tablet taken each day by mouth. the tablet must be taken with food. this is important to get the right levels of active substance in your body. a nutritional drink alone does not replace food. swallow the tablet whole with water. do not chew, crush or split the tablet if you do it may affect the way the medicine is released into your body. if your doctor decides to stop one of the components of eviplera or change the dose of eviplera, you may be given emtricitabine, rilpivirine and/or tenofovir disoproxil separately or with other medicines for the treatment of hiv infection. if you are taking an antacid such as medicines containing magnesium or potassium. take it at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after eviplera. if you are taking an h2-antagonist such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine. take it at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after eviplera. h2-antagonists can only be taken once a day if you take eviplera. h2-antagonists should not be taken twice a day. talk to your doctor about an alternative regimen. if you are taking rifabutin. your doctor may need to give you an additional dose of rilpivirine. take the rilpivirine tablet at the same time you take eviplera. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. if you take more eviplera than you should if you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of eviplera you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, possible side effects). contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take eviplera it is important not to miss a dose of eviplera. if you do miss a dose: if you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take eviplera, you must take the tablet as soon as possible. always take the tablet with food. then take the next dose as usual. if you notice after 12 hours or more of the time you usually take eviplera, then do not take the missed dose. wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. if you vomit less than 4 hours after taking eviplera, take another tablet with food. if you vomit more than 4 hours after taking eviplera you do not need to take another tablet until your next regularly scheduled tablet. do not stop taking eviplera do not stop taking eviplera without talking to your doctor. stopping eviplera can seriously affect your response to future treatment. if eviplera for any reason is stopped, speak to your doctor before you restart taking eviplera tablets. your doctor may consider giving you the components of eviplera separately if you are having problems or need your dose adjusted. when your supply of eviplera starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. this is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. the virus may then become harder to treat. if you have hiv infection and hepatitis b, it is especially important not to stop your eviplera treatment without talking to your doctor first. some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three active substances of eviplera). if eviplera is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis b treatment. you may need blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment. in some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life- threatening. tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis b infection. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "eviplera", "Type":

them. possible side effects: tell a doctor immediately lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of some hiv medicines. lactic acidosis occurs more often in women particularly if they are overweight, and in people with liver disease. the following may be signs of lactic acidosis: deep, rapid breathing tiredness or drowsiness feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) stomach pain if you think you may have lactic acidosis, tell your doctor immediately. any signs of inflammation or infection. in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. if you notice any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor immediately. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea) difficulty sleeping (insomnia) dizziness, headache rash feeling weak tests may also show: decreases in phosphate levels in the blood increased levels of creatine kinase in the blood that may result in muscle pain and weakness increased levels of cholesterol and/or pancreatic amylase in the blood increased levels of liver enzymes in the blood if any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) decreased appetite depression and depressed mood tiredness, feeling sleepy (somnolence) drowsiness pain, stomach pain or discomfort, feeling bloated, dry mouth abnormal dreams, sleep disorders problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals, wind (flatulence) rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), which may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin in patches other allergic reactions, such as wheezing, swelling or feeling light-headed tests may also show: low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to infection) low platelet count (a type of blood cell involved in clotting blood) decrease in haemoglobin in your blood (low red blood cell count) increased fatty acids (triglycerides), bilirubin or sugar in the blood pancreas problems if any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) anaemia (low red blood cell count) pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat signs or symptoms of inflammation or infection severe skin reactions including rash accompanied by fever, swelling and liver problems damage to kidney tubule cells tests may also show: decreases in potassium in the blood increases in creatinine in your blood changes to your urine if any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) lactic acidosis (see possible side effects: tell a doctor immediately) back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure. your doctor may do blood tests to see if your kidneys are working properly fatty liver yellow skin or eyes, itching or pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the liver inflammation of the kidney, passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) the breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells. if any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. other effects that may be seen during hiv treatment the frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). bone problems. some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as eviplera may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are: joint stiffness joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) difficulty with movement if you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. during hiv therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide
