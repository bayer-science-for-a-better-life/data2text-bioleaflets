Approximate tablet dimensions 15.1 mm x 6.0 mm. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nEntresto is indicated in adult patients for treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced \n\nejection fraction (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Entresto is one tablet of 49 mg/51 mg twice daily, except in the \n\nsituations described below. The dose should be doubled at 2-4 weeks to the target dose of one tablet of \n\n97 mg/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nIf patients experience tolerability issues (systolic blood pressure [SBP] \u226495 mmHg, symptomatic \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia, renal dysfunction), adjustment of concomitant medicinal products, \n\ntemporary down\u2013titration or discontinuation of Entresto is recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn PARADIGM-HF study, Entresto was administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, \n\nin place of an ACE inhibitor or other angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (see section 5.1). There is \n\nlimited experience in patients not currently taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB or taking low doses of \n\nthese medicinal products, therefore a starting dose of 24 mg/26 mg twice daily and slow dose titration \n\n(doubling every 3-4 weeks) are recommended in these patients (see \u201cTitration\u201d in section 5.1). \n\n \n\nTreatment should not be initiated in patients with serum potassium level >5.4 mmol/l or with SBP \n\n<100 mmHg (see section 4.4). A starting dose of 24 mg/26 mg twice daily should be considered for \n\npatients with SBP \u2265100 to 110 mmHg. \n\n \n\nEntresto should not be co-administered with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB. Due to the potential risk of \n\nangioedema when used concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor, it must not be started for at least \n\n36 hours after discontinuing ACE inhibitor therapy (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe valsartan contained within Entresto is more bioavailable than the valsartan in other marketed \n\ntablet formulations (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should take the next dose at the scheduled time. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nThe dose should be in line with the renal function of the elderly patient. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] \n\n60-90 ml/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment. A starting dose of 24 mg/26 mg twice daily should be \n\nconsidered in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1.73 m2). As there is very \n\nlimited clinical experience in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see \n\nsection 5.1) Entresto should be used with caution and a starting dose of 24 mg/26 mg twice daily is \n\nrecommended. There is no experience in patients with end-stage renal disease and use of Entresto is \n\nnot recommended. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required when administering Entresto to patients with mild hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh A classification). There is limited clinical experience in patients with moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh B classification) or with AST/ALT values more than twice the upper limit of \n\nthe normal range. Entresto should be used with caution in these patients and the recommended starting \n\ndose is 24 mg/26 mg twice daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Entresto is contraindicated in patients with \n\nsevere hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis (Child-Pugh C classification) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Entresto in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\nEntresto may be administered with or without food (see section 5.2). The tablets must be swallowed \n\nwith a glass of water. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use with ACE inhibitors (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Entresto must not be \nadministered until 36 hours after discontinuing ACE inhibitor therapy. \n\n\uf0b7 Known history of angioedema related to previous ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n\uf0b7 Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema (see section 4.4). \n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use with aliskiren-containing medicinal products in patients with diabetes mellitus \nor in patients with renal impairment (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis (see section 4.2). \n\n\uf0b7 Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 The combination of sacubitril/valsartan with an ACE inhibitor is contraindicated due to the \nincreased risk of angioedema (see section 4.3). Sacubitril/valsartan must not be initiated until \n\n36 hours after taking the last dose of ACE inhibitor therapy. If treatment with \n\nsacubitril/valsartan is stopped, ACE inhibitor therapy must not be initiated until 36 hours after \n\nthe last dose of sacubitril/valsartan (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 The combination of sacubitril/valsartan with direct renin inhibitors such as aliskiren is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). The combination of sacubitril/valsartan with aliskiren-\n\ncontaining medicinal products is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or in patients \n\nwith renal impairment (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Entresto contains valsartan, and therefore should not be co-administered with another ARB \ncontaining medicinal product (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nHypotension \n\n \n\nTreatment should not be initiated unless SBP is \u2265100 mmHg. Patients with SBP <100 mmHg were not \n\nstudied (see section 5.1). Cases of symptomatic hypotension have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith sacubitril/valsartan during clinical studies (see section 4.8), especially in patients \u226565 years old, \n\npatients with renal disease and patients with low SBP (<112 mmHg). When initiating therapy or \n\nduring dose titration with sacubitril/valsartan, blood pressure should be monitored routinely. If \n\nhypotension occurs, temporary down-titration or discontinuation of sacubitril/valsartan is \n\nrecommended (see section 4.2). Dose adjustment of diuretics, concomitant antihypertensives and \n\ntreatment of other causes of hypotension (e.g. hypovolaemia) should be considered. Symptomatic \n\nhypotension is more likely to occur if the patient has been volume-depleted, e.g. by diuretic therapy, \n\ndietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Sodium and/or volume depletion should be corrected \n\nbefore starting treatment with sacubitril/valsartan, however, such corrective action must be carefully \n\nweighed against the risk of volume overload. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nImpaired renal function \n\n \n\nEvaluation of patients with heart failure should always include assessment of renal function. Patients \n\nwith mild and moderate renal impairment are more at risk of developing hypotension (see section 4.2). \n\nThere is very limited clinical experience in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated GFR \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73m2) and these patients may be at greatest risk of hypotension (see section 4.2). There \n\nis no experience in patients with end-stage renal disease and use of sacubitril/valsartan is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nWorsening renal function \n\n \n\nUse of sacubitril/valsartan may be associated with decreased renal function. The risk may be further \n\nincreased by dehydration or concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) (see \n\nsection 4.5). Down-titration should be considered in patients who develop a clinically significant \n\ndecrease in renal function. \n\n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\n \n\nTreatment should not be initiated if the serum potassium level is >5.4 mmol/l. Use of \n\nsacubitril/valsartan may be associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, although hypokalaemia \n\nmay also occur (see section 4.8). Monitoring of serum potassium is recommended, especially in \n\npatients who have risk factors such as renal impairment, diabetes mellitus or hypoaldosteronism or \n\nwho are on a high potassium diet or on mineralocorticoid antagonists (see section 4.2). If patients \n\nexperience clinically significant hyperkalaemia adjustment of concomitant medicinal products, or \n\ntemporary down\u2013titration or discontinuation is recommended. If serum potassium level is >5.4 mmol/l \n\ndiscontinuation should be considered. \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\n \n\nAngioedema has been reported in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan. If angioedema occurs, \n\nsacubitril/valsartan should be immediately discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring \n\nshould be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. It \n\nmust not be re-administered. In cases of confirmed angioedema where swelling has been confined to \n\nthe face and lips, the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have \n\nbeen useful in relieving symptoms. \n\n \n\nAngioedema associated with laryngeal oedema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the \n\ntongue, glottis or larynx likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g. adrenaline \n\nsolution 1 mg/1 ml (0.3-0.5 ml), and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be \n\npromptly administered. \n\n \n\nPatients with a prior history of angioedema were not studied. As they may be at higher risk for \n\nangioedema, caution is recommended if sacubitril/valsartan is used in these patients. \n\nsacubitril/valsartan is contraindicated in patients with a known history of angioedema related to \n\nprevious ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy or with hereditary or idiopathic angioedema (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nBlack patients have an increased susceptibility to develop angioedema (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with renal artery stenosis \n\n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan may increase blood urea and serum creatinine levels in patients with bilateral or \n\nunilateral renal artery stenosis. Caution is required in patients with renal artery stenosis and \n\nmonitoring of renal function is recommended. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPatients with NYHA functional classification IV \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when initiating sacubitril/valsartan in patients with NYHA functional \n\nclassification IV due to limited clinical experience in this population. \n\n \n\nB-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) \n\n \n\nBNP is not a suitable biomarker of heart failure in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan because it \n\nis a neprilysin substrate (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThere is limited clinical experience in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B \n\nclassification) or with AST/ALT values more than twice the upper limit of the normal range. In these \n\npatients, exposure may be increased and safety is not established. Caution is therefore recommended \n\nwhen using it in these patients (see section 4.2 and 5.2). Sacubitril/valsartan is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis (Child-Pugh C classification) \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteractions resulting in a contraindication \n\n \n\nACE inhibitors \n\nThe concomitant use of sacubitril/valsartan with ACE inhibitors is contraindicated, as the concomitant \n\ninhibition of neprilysin (NEP) and ACE may increase the risk of angioedema. Sacubitril/valsartan \n\nmust not be started until 36 hours after taking the last dose of ACE inhibitor therapy. ACE inhibitor \n\ntherapy must not be started until 36 hours after the last dose of sacubitril/valsartan (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.3). \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nThe concomitant use of sacubitril/valsartan with aliskiren-containing medicinal products is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or in patients with renal impairment (eGFR \n\n<60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). The combination of sacubitril/valsartan with direct renin \n\ninhibitors such as aliskiren is not recommended (see section 4.4). Combination of sacubitril/valsartan \n\nwith aliskiren is potentially associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, \n\nhyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nInteractions resulting in concomitant use not being recommended \n\n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan contains valsartan, and therefore should not be co-administered with another ARB \n\ncontaining medicinal product (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInteractions requiring precautions \n\n \n\nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates, e.g. statins \n\nIn vitro data indicate that sacubitril inhibits OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. Entresto may \n\ntherefore increase the systemic exposure of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates such as statins. \n\nCo-administration of sacubitril/valsartan increased the Cmax of atorvastatin and its metabolites by up to \n\n2-fold and AUC by up to 1.3-fold. Caution should be exercised when co-administering \n\nsacubitril/valsartan with statins. No clinically relevant interaction was observed when simvastatin and \n\nEntresto were co-administered. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPDE5 inhibitors including sildenafil \n\nAddition of a single dose of sildenafil to sacubitril/valsartan at steady state in patients with \n\nhypertension was associated with a significantly greater blood pressure reduction compared to \n\nadministration of sacubitril/valsartan alone. Therefore, caution should be exercised when sildenafil or \n\nanother PDE5 inhibitor is initiated in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan. \n\n \n\nPotassium \n\nConcomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (triamterene, amiloride), mineralocorticoid \n\nantagonists (e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone), potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium or other agents (such as heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium, and to increases \n\nin serum creatinine. Monitoring of serum potassium is recommended if sacubitril/valsartan is \n\nco-administered with these agents (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) \n\ninhibitors \n\nIn elderly patients, volume-depleted patients (including those on diuretic therapy), or patients with \n\ncompromised renal function, concomitant use of sacubitril/valsartan and NSAIDs may lead to an \n\nincreased risk of worsening of renal function. Therefore, monitoring of renal function is recommended \n\nwhen initiating or modifying treatment in patients on sacubitril/valsartan who are taking NSAIDs \n\nconcomitantly (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLithium \n\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \n\nconcomitant administration of lithium with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \n\nInteractions between sacubitril/valsartan and lithium have not been investigated. Therefore, this \n\ncombination is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum \n\nlithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased \n\nfurther. \n\n \nFurosemide \n\nCo-administration of sacubitril/valsartan and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nsacubitril/valsartan but reduced Cmax and AUC of furosemide by 50% and 28%, respectively. While \n\nthere was no relevant change in urine volume, the urinary excretion of sodium was reduced within \n\n4 hours and 24 hours after co-administration. The average daily dose of furosemide was unchanged \n\nfrom baseline until the end of the PARADIGM-HF study in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan. \n\n \n\nNitrates, e.g. nitroglycerine \n\nThere was no drug-drug interaction between sacubitril/valsartan and intravenously administered \n\nnitroglycerin with regard to blood pressure reduction. Co-administration of nitroglycerin and \n\nsacubitril/valsartan was associated with a treatment difference of 5 bpm in heart rate compared to the \n\nadministration of nitroglycerine alone. A similar effect on the heart rate may occur when \n\nsacubitril/valsartan is co-administered with sublingual, oral or transdermal nitrates. In general no dose \n\nadjustment is required. \n\n \n\nOATP and MRP2 transporters \n\nThe active metabolite of sacubitril (LBQ657) and valsartan are OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and \n\nOAT3 substrates; valsartan is also a MRP2 substrate. Therefore, co-administration of \n\nsacubitril/valsartan with inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3 (e.g. rifampicin, ciclosporin), \n\nOAT1 (e.g. tenofovir, cidofovir) or MRP2 (e.g. ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure of \n\nLBQ657 or valsartan. Appropriate care should be exercised when initiating or ending concomitant \n\ntreatment with such medicinal products. \n\n \n\nMetformin \n\nCo-administration of sacubitril/valsartan with metformin reduced both Cmax and AUC of metformin by \n\n23%. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, when initiating therapy with \n\nsacubitril/valsartan in patients receiving metformin, the clinical status of the patient should be \n\nevaluated. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nNo significant interaction \n\n \n\nNo clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction was observed when sacubitril/valsartan was \n\nco-administered with digoxin, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, omeprazole, carvedilol or a \n\ncombination of levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThe use of sacubitril/valsartan is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy and is \n\ncontraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however, a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with ARBs, similar \n\nrisks may exist for this class of medicinal product. Unless continued ARB therapy is considered \n\nessential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments \n\nwhich have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, \n\ntreatment with ARBs should be stopped immediately and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be \n\nstarted. Exposure to ARBs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to ARBs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of \n\nrenal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken ARBs should be closely \n\nobserved for hypotension (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nSacubitril \n\nThere are no data from the use of sacubitril in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan \n\nThere are no data from the use of sacubitril/valsartan in pregnant women. Animal studies with \n\nsacubitril/valsartan have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether sacubitril/valsartan is excreted in human milk. The components of Entresto, \n\nsacubitril and valsartan, were excreted in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Because of the \n\npotential risk for adverse reactions in breast-fed newborns/infants, it is not recommended during \n\nbreast-feeding. A decision should be made whether to abstain from breast-feeding or to discontinue \n\nEntresto while breast-feeding, taking into account the importance of sacubitril/valsartan to the mother. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no available data on the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on human fertility. No impairment of \n\nfertility was demonstrated in studies with it in male and female rats (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When driving \n\nvehicles or operating machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or fatigue \n\nmay occur. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with sacubitril/valsartan were \n\nhypotension (17.6%), hyperkalaemia (11.6%) and renal impairment (10.1%) (see section 4.4). \n\nAngioedema was reported in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan (0.5%) (see description of \n\nselected adverse reactions). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked by System organ class and then by frequency with the most frequent \n\nfirst, using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n\n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are ranked in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 1 List of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Preferred term Frequency category \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders \nAnaemia Common \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nHyperkalaemia* Very common \n\nHypokalaemia Common \n\nHypoglycaemia Common \n\nNervous system disorders Dizziness Common \n\nHeadache Common \n\nSyncope Common \n\nDizziness postural Uncommon \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Vertigo Common \n\nVascular disorders Hypotension* Very common \n\nOrthostatic hypotension Common \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \nCough Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Common \n\nNausea Common \n\nGastritis Common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nPruritus Uncommon \n\nRash Uncommon \n\nAngioedema* Uncommon \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Renal impairment* Very common \n\nRenal failure (renal failure, \n\nacute renal failure) \nCommon \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nFatigue Common \n\nAsthenia Common \n\n*See description of selected adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAngioedema has been reported in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan. In PARADIGM-HF, \n\nangioedema was reported in 0.5% of patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan, compared with 0.2% of \n\npatients treated with enalapril. A higher incidence of angioedema was observed in Black patients \n\ntreated with sacubitril/valsartan (2.4%) and enalapril (0.5%) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nHyperkalaemia and serum potassium \n\nIn PARADIGM-HF, hyperkalaemia and serum potassium concentrations >5.4 mmol/l were reported in \n\n11.6% and 19.7% of sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients and 14.0% and 21.1% of enalapril-treated \n\npatients, respectively. \n\n \n\nBlood pressure \n\nIn PARADIGM-HF, hypotension and clinically relevant low systolic blood pressure (<90 mmHg and \n\ndecrease from baseline of >20 mmHg) were reported in 17.6% and 4.76% of sacubitril/valsartan-\n\ntreated patients compared with 11.9% and 2.67% of enalapril-treated patients, respectively. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn PARADIGM-HF, renal impairment was reported in 10.1% of sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients \n\nand 11.5% of enalapril-treated patients. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nLimited data are available with regard to overdose in humans. A single dose of 583 mg \n\nsacubitril/617 mg valsartan and multiple doses of 437 mg sacubitril/463 mg valsartan (14 days) \n\nwere studied in healthy volunteers and were well tolerated. \n\n \n\nHypotension is the most likely symptom of overdose due to the blood pressure lowering effects of \n\nsacubitril/valsartan. Symptomatic treatment should be provided. \n\n \n\nThe medicinal product is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis due to high protein binding (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARBs), other combinations, ATC code: C09DX04 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan exhibits the mechanism of action of an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor by \n\nsimultaneously inhibiting neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase; NEP) via LBQ657, the active metabolite \n\nof the prodrug sacubitril, and by blocking the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor via valsartan. The \n\ncomplementary cardiovascular benefits of sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure patients are attributed to \n\nthe enhancement of peptides that are degraded by neprilysin, such as natriuretic peptides (NP), by \n\nLBQ657 and the simultaneous inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II by valsartan. NPs exert their \n\neffects by activating membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors, resulting in increased \n\nconcentrations of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which could result \n\nin vasodilation, natriuresis and diuresis, increased glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, \n\ninhibition of renin and aldosterone release, reduction of sympathetic activity, and anti-hypertrophic \n\nand anti-fibrotic effects. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nValsartan inhibits detrimental cardiovascular and renal effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking \n\nthe AT1 receptor, and also inhibits angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone release. This prevents \n\nsustained activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that would result in vasoconstriction, \n\nrenal sodium and fluid retention, activation of cellular growth and proliferation, and subsequent \n\nmaladaptive cardiovascular remodelling. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nThe pharmacodynamic effects of sacubitril/valsartan were evaluated after single and multiple dose \n\nadministrations in healthy subjects and in patients with heart failure, and are consistent with \n\nsimultaneous neprilysin inhibition and RAAS blockade. In a 7-day valsartan-controlled study in \n\npatients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), administration of sacubitril/valsartan resulted in an \n\ninitial increase in natriuresis, increased urine cGMP, and decreased plasma levels of mid-regional pro-\n\natrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide \n\n(NT-proBNP) compared to valsartan. In a 21-day study in HFrEF patients, sacubitril/valsartan \n\nsignificantly increased urine ANP and cGMP and plasma cGMP, and decreased plasma NT-proBNP, \n\naldosterone and endothelin-1 compared to baseline. The AT1-receptor was also blocked as evidenced \n\nby increased plasma renin activity and plasma renin concentrations. In the PARADIGM-HF study, \n\nsacubitril/valsartan decreased plasma NT-proBNP and increased plasma BNP and urine cGMP \n\ncompared with enalapril. BNP is not a suitable biomarker of heart failure in patients treated with \n\nsacubitril/valsartan because BNP is a neprilysin substrate (see section 4.4). NT-proBNP is not a \n\nneprilysin substrate and is therefore a more suitable biomarker. \n \n\nIn a thorough QTc clinical study in healthy male subjects, single doses of sacubitril/valsartan 194 mg \n\nsacubitril/206 mg valsartan and 583 mg sacubitril/617 mg valsartan had no effect on cardiac \n\nrepolarisation. \n\n \n\nNeprilysin is one of multiple enzymes involved in the clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) from the brain and \n\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Administration of sacubitril/valsartan 194 mg sacubitril/206 mg valsartan \n\nonce daily for two weeks to healthy subjects was associated with an increase in CSF A\u03b21-38 compared \n\nto placebo; there were no changes in concentrations of CSF A\u03b21-40 and 1-42. The clinical relevance \n\nof this finding is not known (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe 24 mg/26 mg, 49 mg/51 mg and 97 mg/103 mg strengths are in some publications referred to as \n\n50, 100 or 200 mg. \n\n \n\nPARADIGM-HF \n\nPARADIGM-HF, the pivotal phase 3 study, was a multinational, randomised, double-blind study of \n\n8,442 patients comparing sacubitril/valsartan to enalapril, both given to adult patients with chronic \n\nheart failure, NYHA class II-IV and reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction \n\n[LVEF] \u226440%, amended later to \u226435%) in addition to other heart failure therapy. The primary \n\nendpoint was the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalisation for heart failure (HF). \n\nPatients with SBP <100 mmHg, severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and severe \n\nhepatic impairment were excluded at screening and therefore not prospectively studied. \n\n \n\nPrior to study participation, patients were well treated with standard of care therapy which included \n\nACE inhibitors/ARBs (>99%), beta blockers (94%), mineralocorticoid antagonists (58%) and diuretics \n\n(82%). The median follow-up duration was 27 months and patients were treated for up to 4.3 years. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nPatients were required to discontinue their existing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy and enter a \n\nsequential single-blind run-in period during which they received treatment with enalapril 10 mg twice \n\ndaily, followed by single-blind treatment with sacubitril/valsartan 100 mg twice daily, increasing to \n\n200 mg twice daily (see section 4.8 for discontinuations during this period). They were then \n\nrandomised to the double-blind period of the study, during which they received either \n\nsacubitril/valsartan200 mg or enalapril 10 mg twice daily [sacubitril/valsartan (n=4,209); enalapril \n\n(n=4,233)]. \n\n \n\nThe mean age of the population studied was 64 years of age and 19% were 75 years of age or older. At \n\nrandomisation, 70% of patients were NYHA class II, 24% were class III and 0.7% were class IV. The \n\nmean LVEF was 29% and there were 963 (11.4%) patients with a baseline LVEF >35% and \u226440%. \n\n \nIn the sacubitril/valsartan group, 76% of patients remained on the target dose of 200 mg twice daily at \n\nthe end of the study (mean daily dose of 375 mg). In the enalapril group, 75% of patients remained on \n\nthe target dose of 10 mg twice daily at the end of the study (mean daily dose of 18.9 mg). \n\n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan was superior to enalapril, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure \n\nhospitalisations to 21.8% compared to 26.5% for enalapril treated patients. The absolute risk \n\nreductions were 4.7% for the composite of the CV death or HF hospitalisation, 3.1% for CV death \n\nalone, and 2.8% for first HF hospitalisation alone. The relative risk reduction was 20% versus \n\nenalapril (see Table 2). This effect was observed early and was sustained throughout the duration of \n\nthe study (see Figure 1). Both components contributed to the risk reduction. Sudden death accounted \n\nfor 45% of cardiovascular deaths and was reduced by 20% in sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients \n\ncompared to enalapril-treated patients (HR 0.80, p=0.0082). Pump failure accounted for 26% of \n\ncardiovascular deaths and was reduced by 21% in sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients compared to \n\nenalapril-treated patients (HR 0.79, p=0.0338). \n\n \n\nThis risk reduction was consistently observed across subgroups including: gender, age, race, \n\ngeography, NYHA class (II/III), ejection fraction, renal function, history of diabetes or hypertension, \n\nprior heart failure therapy, and atrial fibrillation. \n\n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan improved survival with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality of 2.8% \n\n(sacubitril/valsartan, 17%, enalapril, 19.8%). The relative risk reduction was 16% compared with \n\nenalapril (see Table 2). \n\n \n\nTable 2 Treatment effect for the primary composite endpoint, its components and all-cause \n\nmortality over a median follow-up of 27 months \n\n \n\n Sacubitril/ \n\nvalsartan \n\nN=4,187\u266f \n\nn (%) \n\nEnalapril \n\nN=4,212\u266f \n\nn (%) \n\nHazard ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\nRelative \n\nrisk \n\nreduction \n\np-value *** \n\nPrimary composite \n\nendpoint of CV death \n\nand heart failure \n\nhospitalisations* \n\n914 (21.83) 1,117 (26.52) 0.80 (0.73, 0.87) 20% 0.0000002 \n\nIndividual components of the primary composite endpoint \n\nCV death** 558 (13.33) 693 (16.45) 0.80 (0.71, 0.89) 20% 0.00004 \n\nFirst heart failure \n\nhospitalisation \n\n537 (12.83) 658 (15.62) 0.79 (0.71, 0.89) 21% 0.00004 \n\nSecondary endpoint \n\nAll-cause mortality 711 (16.98) 835 (19.82) 0.84 (0.76, 0.93) 16% 0.0005 \n\n*The primary endpoint was defined as the time to first event of CV death or hospitalisation for HF. \n\n**CV death includes all patients who died up to the cut-off date irrespective of previous \n\nhospitalisation. \n\n***One-sided p-value \n\u266f Full analysis set \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for the primary composite endpoint and the CV death \n\ncomponent \n\n \nTime to first occurrence of CV death or\nheart failure hospitalisations in PARADIGM-HF\n\n0\n0\n\n40\n\n30 Enalapril (N=4212)\n\nEntresto (N=4187)\n\nP<0.0001\nHR (95%CI):\n\n0.798 (0.731, 0.871)\n\n20\n\n10\n\n180 360 540 720\n\nTime since randomisation (days)\n\n900 1080 1260\n\nK\nM\n\n e\ns\nti\nm\n\na\nte\n\n o\nf \nc\nu\n\nm\nu\n\nla\nti\nve\n\nfa\nil\nu\n\nre\n r\na\n\nte\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n4187 3922 3663 3018 2257 1544 896 249\n\n4212\n\nEntresto\n\nNo. at risk\n\n3883 3579 2922 2123 1488 853 236Enalapril\n\nTime to occurrence of CV death in PARADIGM-HF\n\n0\n\n0\n\n40\n\n30 Enalapril (N=4212)\n\nEntresto (N=4187)\n\nP<0.0001\n\nHR (95%CI):\n\n0.799 (0.715, 0.893)\n\n20\n\n10\n\n180 360 540 720\n\nTime since randomisation (days)\n\n900 1080 1260\n\nK\nM\n\n e\ns\nti\nm\n\na\nte\n\n o\nf \n\nc\nu\n\nm\nu\n\nla\nti\nve\n\nfa\nilu\n\nre\n r\n\na\nte\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n4187 4056 3891 3282 2478 1716 1005 280\n\n4212\n\nEntresto\n\n4051 3860 3231 2410 1726 994 279Enalapril\n\nNo. at risk\n\n \n \n\nTITRATION \n\nTITRATION was a 12-week safety and tolerability study in 538 patients with chronic heart failure \n\n(NYHA class II\u2013IV) and systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction \u226435%) na\u00efve to ACE \n\ninhibitor or ARB therapy or on varying doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs prior to study entry. Patients \n\nreceived a starting dose of sacubitril/valsartan of 50 mg twice daily and were up-titrated to 100 mg \n\ntwice daily, then to the target dose of 200 mg twice daily, with either a 3-week or a 6-week regimen. \n\n \n\nMore patients who were na\u00efve to previous ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy or on low-dose therapy \n\n(equivalent to <10 mg enalapril/day) were able to achieve and maintain sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg \n\nwhen up-titrated over 6 weeks (84.8%) versus 3 weeks (73.6%). Overall, 76% of patients achieved and \n\nmaintained the target dose of sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg twice daily without any dose interruption or \n\ndown-titration over 12 weeks. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nsacubitril/valsartan in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of heart failure \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe valsartan contained within sacubitril/valsartan is more bioavailable than the valsartan in other \n\nmarketed tablet formulations; 26 mg, 51 mg, and 103 mg of valsartan in sacubitril/valsartan is \n\nequivalent to 40 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg of valsartan in other marketed tablet formulations, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration, sacubitril/valsartan dissociates into valsartan and the prodrug sacubitril. \n\nSacubitril is further metabolised to the active metabolite LBQ657. These reach peak plasma \n\nconcentrations in 2 hours, 1 hour, and 2 hours, respectively. The oral absolute bioavailability of \n\nsacubitril and valsartan is estimated to be more than 60% and 23%, respectively. \n\n \n\nFollowing twice daily dosing of sacubitril/valsartan, steady-state levels of sacubitril, LBQ657 and \n\nvalsartan are reached in three days. At steady state, sacubitril and valsartan do not accumulate \n\nsignificantly, while LBQ657 accumulates 1.6-fold. Administration with food has no clinically \n\nsignificant impact on the systemic exposures of sacubitril, LBQ657 and valsartan. Sacubitril/valsartan \n\ncan be administered with or without food. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nSacubitril, LBQ657 and valsartan are highly bound to plasma proteins (94-97%). Based on the \n\ncomparison of plasma and CSF exposures, LBQ657 crosses the blood brain barrier to a limited extent \n\n(0.28%). The average apparent volume of distribution of valsartan and sacubitril were 75 litres to \n\n103 litres, respectively. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nSacubitril is readily converted to LBQ657 by carboxylesterases 1b and 1c; LBQ657 is not further \n\nmetabolised to a significant extent. Valsartan is minimally metabolised, as only about 20% of the dose \n\nis recovered as metabolites. A hydroxyl metabolite of valsartan has been identified in plasma at low \n\nconcentrations (<10%). \n\n \n\nSince CYP450-enzyme-mediated metabolism of sacubitril and valsartan is minimal, co-administration \n\nwith medicinal products that impact CYP450 enzymes is not expected to impact the pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nIn vitro metabolism studies indicate that potential for CYP450-based drug interactions is low since \n\nthere is limited metabolism of sacubitril/valsartan via CYP450 enzymes. Sacubitril/valsartan does not \n\ninduce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration, 52-68% of sacubitril (primarily as LBQ657) and ~13% of valsartan and \n\nits metabolites are excreted in urine; 37-48% of sacubitril (primarily as LBQ657) and 86% of valsartan \n\nand its metabolites are excreted in faeces. \n\n \n\nSacubitril, LBQ657 and valsartan are eliminated from plasma with a mean elimination half-life (T\u00bd) of \n\napproximately 1.43 hours, 11.48 hours, and 9.90 hours, respectively. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of sacubitril, LBQ657 and valsartan were approximately linear over a \n\nsacubitril/valsartan dose range of 24 mg sacubitril/26 mg valsartan to 97 mg sacubitril/103 mg \n\nvalsartan. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nLBQ657 and valsartan exposure are increased in subjects over 65 years of age by 42% and 30%, \n\nrespectively, compared to younger subjects. \n\n \n\nImpaired renal function \n\nA correlation was observed between renal function and systemic exposure to LBQ657 in patients with \n\nmild to severe renal impairment. The exposure of LBQ657 in patients with moderate \n\n(30 ml/min/1.73 m2 \u2264 eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and severe renal impairment (15 ml/min/1.73 m2 \u2264 \n\neGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) was 1.4-fold and 2.2-fold higher compared to patients with mild renal \n\nimpairment (60 ml/min/1.73 m2 \u2264 eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m2), the largest group of patients enrolled in \n\nPARADIGM-HF). The exposure of valsartan was similar in patients with moderate and severe renal \n\nimpairment compared to patients with mild renal impairment. No studies have been performed in \n\npatients undergoing dialysis. However, LBQ657 and valsartan are highly bound to plasma protein and \n\ntherefore unlikely to be effectively removed by dialysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nImpaired hepatic function \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the exposures of sacubitril increased by 1.5- and \n\n3.4- fold, LBQ657 increased by 1.5- and 1.9-fold, and valsartan increased by 1.2-fold and 2.1-fold, \n\nrespectively, compared to matching healthy subjects. However, in patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment, the exposures of free concentrations of LBQ657 increased by 1.47- and 3.08-fold, \n\nrespectively, and the exposures of free concentrations of valsartan increased by 1.09-fold and \n\n2.20-fold, respectively, compared to matching healthy subjects. Sacubitril/valsartan has not been \n\nstudied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis (see sections 4.3 and \n\n4.4). \n \n\nEffect of gender \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of sacubitril/valsartan (sacubitril, LBQ657 and valsartan) are similar between \n\nmale and female subjects. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data (including studies with sacubitril and valsartan components and/or \n\nsacubitril/valsartan) reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and fertility. \n\n \n\nFertility, reproduction and development \n\n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan treatment during organogenesis resulted in increased embryofoetal lethality in rats \n\nat doses \u226549 mg sacubitril/51 mg valsartan/kg/day (\u22640.72-fold the maximum recommended human \n\ndose [MRHD] on the basis of AUC) and rabbits at doses \u22654.9 mg sacubitril/5.1 mg valsartan/kg/day \n\n(2-fold and 0.03-fold the MRHD on the basis of valsartan and LBQ657 AUC, respectively). It is \n\nteratogenic based on a low incidence of foetal hydrocephaly, associated with maternally toxic doses, \n\nwhich was observed in rabbits at a sacubitril/valsartan dose of \u22654.9  mg sacubitril/5.1 mg \n\nvalsartan/kg/day. Cardiovascular abnormalities (mainly cardiomegaly) were observed in rabbit \n\nfoetuses at a maternally non-toxic dose (1.46 mg sacubitril/1.54 mg valsartan/kg/day). A slight \n\nincrease in two foetal skeletal variations (misshapen sternebra, sternebra bipartite ossification) was \n\nobserved in rabbits at a sacubitril/valsartan dose of 4.9 mg sacubitril/5.1 mg valsartan/kg/day. The \n\nadverse embryofoetal effects of sacubitril/valsartan are attributed to the angiotensin receptor \n\nantagonist activity (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nSacubitril treatment during organogenesis resulted in embryo-foetal lethality and embryo-foetal \n\ntoxicity (decreased foetal body weights and skeletal malformations) in rabbits at doses associated with \n\nmaternal toxicity (500 mg/kg/day; 5.7-fold the MRHD on the basis of LBQ657 AUC). A slight \n\ngeneralised delay in ossification was observed at doses of >50 mg/kg/day. This finding is not \n\nconsidered adverse. No evidence of embryo-foetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in rats \n\ntreated with sacubitril. The embryo-foetal no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for sacubitril \n\nwas at least 750 mg/kg/day in rats and 200 mg/kg/day in rabbits (2.2-fold the MRHD on the basis of \n\nLBQ657 AUC). \n\n \n\nPre- and postnatal development studies in rats conducted with sacubitril at high doses up to \n\n750 mg/kg/day (2.2-fold the MRHD on the basis of AUC) and valsartan at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day \n\n(0.86-fold the MRHD on the basis of AUC) indicate that treatment with sacubitril/valsartan during \n\norganogenesis, gestation and lactation may affect pup development and survival. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nOther preclinical findings \n\n \n\nSacubitril/valsartan \n\nThe effects of sacubitril/valsartan on amyloid-\u03b2 concentrations in CSF and brain tissue were assessed \n\nin young (2-4 years old) cynomolgus monkeys treated with sacubitril/valsartan (24 mg \n\nsacubitril/26 mg valsartan/kg/day) for two weeks. In this study CSF A\u03b2 clearance in cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys was reduced, increasing CSF A\u03b21-40, 1-42 and 1-38 levels; there was no corresponding \n\nincrease in A\u03b2 levels in the brain. Increases in CSF A\u03b21-40 and 1-42 were not observed in a two-week \n\nhealthy volunteer study in humans (see section 5.1). Additionally, in a toxicology study in cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys treated with sacubitril/valsartan at 146 mg sacubitril/154 mg valsartan/kg/day for 39 weeks, \n\nthere was no evidence for the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain. Amyloid content was not, \n\nhowever, measured quantitatively in this study. \n\n \n\nSacubitril \n\nIn juvenile rats treated with sacubitril (postnatal days 7 to 70), there was a reduction in age-related \n\nbone mass development and bone elongation. A study in adult rats showed only a minimal transient \n\ninhibitory effect on bone mineral density but not on any other parameters relevant for bone growth, \n\nsuggesting no relevant effect of sacubitril on bone in adult patient populations under normal \n\nconditions. However, a mild transient interference of sacubitril with the early phase of fracture healing \n\nin adults cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nIn juvenile rats treated with valsartan (postnatal days 7 to 70), doses as low as 1 mg/kg/day produced \n\npersistent irreversible kidney changes consisting of tubular nephropathy (sometimes accompanied by \n\ntubular epithelial necrosis) and pelvic dilatation.

It delivers two active \n\nsubstances, sacubitril and valsartan. \n\n \n\nEntresto is used to treat a type of long-term heart failure in adults. \n\n \n\nThis type of heart failure occurs when the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the lungs \n\nand the rest of the body. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, \n\ntiredness and ankle swelling. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Entresto \n\n \n\nDo not take Entresto \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to sacubitril, valsartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \nin section 6). \n\n\uf0b7 if you are taking another type of medicine called an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril). ACE inhibitors are used to treat high \n\nblood pressure or heart failure. If you have been taking an ACE inhibitor, wait for 36 hours after \n\ntaking the last dose before you start to take Entresto (see \u201cOther medicines and Entresto\u201d). \n\n\uf0b7 if you or a member of your family have ever had a reaction called angioedema (swelling of the \nface, lips, tongue and/or throat, difficulties in breathing) when taking an ACE inhibitor or an \n\nangiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (such as valsartan, telmisartan or irbesartan). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are being treated with a blood pressure \nlowering medicine containing aliskiren (see \u201cOther medicines and Entresto\u201d). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have severe liver disease. \n\n\uf0b7 if you are more than 3 months pregnant (it is also better to avoid this medicine in early \npregnancy, see \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d). \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Entresto and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Entresto: \n\n\uf0b7 if you are being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or aliskiren (see \u201cDo not \ntake Entresto\u201d). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have ever had angioedema (see \u201cDo not take Entresto\u201d and section 4 \u201cPossible side \neffects\u201d). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have low blood pressure or are taking any other medicines that reduce your blood \npressure (for example, a diuretic) or are suffering from vomiting or diarrhoea, especially if you \n\nare aged 65 years or more, or if you have kidney disease and low blood pressure. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have severe kidney disease. \n\n\uf0b7 if you are suffering from dehydration. \n\n\uf0b7 if your kidney artery has narrowed. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have liver disease. \n \n\nYour doctor may check the amount of potassium in your blood at regular intervals during Entresto \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you take \n\nEntresto. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not give this medicine to children (aged below 18 years) because it has not been studied in this age \n\ngroup. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Entresto \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. It may be necessary to change the dose, to take other precautions, or even to stop taking \n\none of the medicines. This is particularly important for the following medicines: \n\n\uf0b7 ACE inhibitors. Do not take Entresto with ACE inhibitors. If you have been taking an ACE \ninhibitor, wait 36 hours after taking the last dose of the ACE inhibitor before starting to take \n\nEntresto (see \u201cDo not take Entresto\u201d). If you stop taking Entresto, wait 36 hours after taking \n\nyour last dose of Entresto before starting an ACE inhibitor. \n\n\uf0b7 other medicines used to treat heart failure or lower blood pressure, such as angiotensin receptor \nblockers or aliskiren (see \u201cDo not take Entresto\u201d). \n\n\uf0b7 some medicines known as statins that are used to lower high cholesterol levels (for example \natorvastatin). \n\n\uf0b7 sildenafil, a medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction or lung hypertension. \n\n\uf0b7 medicines that increase the amount of potassium in the blood.

Your doctor will \n\nnormally advise you to stop taking this medicine before you become pregnant or as soon as you know \n\nyou are pregnant, and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Entresto. \n\n \n\nThis medicine is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than \n\n3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if it is used after the third month of \n\npregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nEntresto is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding. Tell your doctor if you are \n\nbreast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nBefore you drive a vehicle, use tools or operate machines, or carry out other activities that require \n\nconcentration, make sure you know how Entresto affects you. If you feel dizzy or very tired while \n\ntaking this medicine, do not drive a vehicle, cycle or use any tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Entresto \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nYou will usually start by taking 24 mg/26 mg or 49 mg/51 mg twice a day (one tablet in the morning \n\nand one tablet in the evening). Your doctor will decide your exact starting dose based on which \n\nmedicines you have been taking previously. Your doctor will then adjust the dose depending on how \n\nyou respond to the treatment until the best dose for you is found. \n\n \n\nThe usual recommended target dose is 97 mg/103 mg twice a day (one tablet in the morning and one \n\ntablet in the evening). \n\n \n\nPatients taking Entresto can develop low blood pressure (dizziness, light-headedness), a high level of \n\npotassium in the blood (which would be detected when your doctor performed a blood test) or \n\ndecreased kidney function. If this happens, your doctor may reduce the dose of any other medicine you \n\nare taking, temporarily reduce your Entresto dose, or stop your Entresto treatment completely. \n\n \n\nSwallow the tablets with a glass of water. You can take Entresto with or without food. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Entresto than you should \n\nIf you have accidentally taken too many Entresto tablets, or if someone else has taken your tablets, \n\ncontact your doctor immediately. If you experience severe dizziness and/or fainting, tell your doctor as \n\nquickly as possible and lie down. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Entresto \n\nIt is advisable to take your medicine at the same time each day. However, if you forget to take a dose, \n\nyou should simply take the next one at the scheduled time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a \n\nforgotten tablet. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Entresto \n\nStopping your treatment with Entresto may cause your condition to get worse. Do not stop taking your \n\nmedicine unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSome side effects may be serious. \n\n\uf0b7 Stop taking Entresto and seek immediate medical attention if you notice any swelling of the \nface, lips, tongue and/or throat, which may cause difficulties in breathing or swallowing.

detected when your doctor performed a blood test) or decreased kidney function. if this happens, your doctor may reduce the dose of any other medicine you are taking, temporarily reduce your entresto dose, or stop your entresto treatment completely. swallow the tablets with a glass of water. you can take entresto with or without food. if you take more entresto than you should if you have accidentally taken too many entresto tablets, or if someone else has taken your tablets, contact your doctor immediately. if you experience severe dizziness and/or fainting, tell your doctor as quickly as possible and lie down. if you forget to take entresto it is advisable to take your medicine at the same time each day. however, if you forget to take a dose, you should simply take the next one at the scheduled time. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. if you stop taking entresto stopping your treatment with entresto may cause your condition to get worse. do not
