NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nColobreathe 1,662,500 IU inhalation powder, hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 1,662,500 IU, which is approximately equal to 125 mg of colistimethate \nsodium.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, hard capsule (inhalation powder) \nHard transparent PEG-gelatin capsules containing a fine white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nColobreathe is indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas \naeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older (see  section 5.1). \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial active \nsubstances. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and children of 6 years of age and older \nOne capsule to be inhaled twice daily. \nThe dose interval should be as close as possible to 12 hours.  \n \nThe efficacy of Colobreathe has been demonstrated in a study of 24-weeks duration. Treatment may be \ncontinued for as long as the physician considers that the patient is obtaining clinical benefit. \n \nRenal impairment   \nNo dose adjustment is considered to be necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment  \nNo dose adjustment is considered to be necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Colobreathe in children under 6 years of age have not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor inhalation use only. \nColobreathe capsules are to be used only with the Turbospin powder inhaler. \nThe capsules must not be swallowed. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTo ensure proper administration of the medicinal product, the patient should be shown how to use the \ninhaler by a physician or other health professional, with the first dose being given under medical \nsupervision. \n \nIf other treatments are being taken, they should be taken in the following order: \nInhaled bronchodilators \nChest physiotherapy \nOther inhaled medicinal products \nColobreathe \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, colistin sulphate or polymyxin B. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBronchospasm and coughing \n \nBronchospasm or coughing may occur on inhalation. These reactions usually disappear or \nsignificantly diminish with continued use and may be ameliorated by appropriate treatment with beta2-\nagonists prior to or following dry powder colistimethate sodium inhalation. If bronchospasm or \ncoughing remain problematic, withdrawal of treatment should be considered. \n \nHaemoptysis  \n \nHaemoptysis is a complication in cystic fibrosis and is more frequent in adults. The use \nof colistimethate sodium in patients with clinically significant haemoptysis should be undertaken or \ncontinued only if the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the risks of inducing further \nhaemorrhage. \n \nAcute respiratory exacerbation \n \nIf acute respiratory exacerbations develop additional intravenous or oral antibacterial agent therapy should \nbe considered. \n \nOral fungal super-infection \n \nAfter each inhalation of Colobreathe, the mouth should be rinsed with water.  The rinse should not be \nswallowed.  Rinsing may reduce the risk of developing oral fungal super-infection during treatment \nand may also reduce the unpleasant taste associated with colistimethate sodium. \n \nNephrotoxicity/neurotoxicity \n \nThere is very low transpulmonary absorption of colistimethate after inhalation of Colobreathe (see \nsection 5.2). Care should still be taken in administering Colobreathe to patients who are known to have \na propensity for nephrotoxic or neurotoxic events.  \n \nCaution should be taken with concomitant use of Colobreathe and parenteral or nebulised \ncolistimethate sodium.  \n \nCaution should be taken with concomitant use of colistimethate sodium and potential nephrotoxic or \nneurotoxic medicinal products, including non-depolarising muscle relaxants (see section 4.5).  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nOther \n \nColobreathe should be used with extreme caution in patients with myasthenia gravis because of \npotential for drug induced neuromuscular blockade. \n \nColistimethate sodium should be used with extreme caution in patients with porphyria. \n \nSafety and efficacy have been assessed in controlled studies for up to 24 weeks. (see section 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere is no experience of using Colobreathe concurrently with other inhaled antibacterial agents. \n \nCaution should be taken with concomitant use with other formulations of colistimethate sodium as \nthere is little experience and there is a possibility of summative toxicity.  \n \nNo in-vivo interaction studies have been performed.  \n \nColistimethate sodium and colistin have been investigated in vitro to determine the effects on the \nexpression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes on treating primary cultures of fresh human \nhepatocytes.  Treatment with colistimethate sodium or colistin did not induce the activity of any \nenzyme tested (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4/5).  \n \nConcomitant use of inhaled colistimethate sodium with other medicinal products that are potentially \nnephrotoxic or neurotoxic, such as aminoglycosides, or neuromuscular blocking products, such as \ncurariform agents should be undertaken with caution. \n \nCo-treatment with colistimethate sodium and macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, or \nfluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin should be undertaken with caution in patients \nwith myasthenia gravis (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of inhaled colistimethate sodium in pregnant \nwomen. Studies in animals using parenteral administration have shown reproductive toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). Single dose intravenous studies in human pregnancy show that colistimethate sodium \ncrosses the placenta and consequently there is potential for foetal toxicity if administered during \npregnancy.  \nColistimethate sodium is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential \nnot using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPhysico-chemical data suggest excretion of colistimethate sodium in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded.  A decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from colistimethate sodium therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n \nFertility \n \nColistimethate sodium has no notable effects on fertility in male or female rats or mice. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on the safety profile of colistimethate sodium, neurotoxity may occur with the possibility of \ndizziness, confusion or visual disturbances.  Patients should be warned not to drive or operate \nmachines if this occurs. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Colobreathe has been assessed in a total of 237 subjects (225 cystic fibrosis patients and \n12 healthy volunteers).  Of these, 187 patients aged 6 years and above were exposed to Colobreathe \none capsule twice daily in a 24-week, phase 3 comparative study.  There were 32 patients aged 6-12 \nyears, 41 patients aged 13-17 years and 114 patients aged 18 years and older.  The most commonly \nreported adverse reactions as a percent of all Colobreathe treated patients were: unpleasant taste \n(62%), cough (59.4%), throat irritation (43.9%), dyspnoea (16.6%) and dysphonia (10.7%). Inhalation \nmay induce coughing or bronchospasm which may be controlled by pre-treatment with inhaled beta2 \nagonists.  \n \nSore throat or mouth has been reported with nebulised colistimethate sodium and may occur with \nColobreathe.  This may be related to Candida albicans infection or hypersensitivity.  Skin rash may \nalso indicate hypersensitivity and if this occurs treatment should be withdrawn.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the 24 week clinical study, the following adverse reactions were observed across all ages. \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100), rare ((≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare <1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).  Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem Organ Class Very Common Common Uncommon \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Drug \nhypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n  Weight fluctuation, \ndecreased appetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders   Anxiety \nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Balance disorder, \nheadache \n\nConvulsions, \nsomnolence  \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Tinnitus Ear congestion \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea, \ncough,  \ndysphonia, \nthroat irritation \n\nHaemoptysis, \nbronchospasm,  \nasthma,  \nwheezing,  \nchest discomfort,  \nlower respiratory tract \ninfection,  \nproductive cough, \ncrackles lung \n\nChest pain, \ndyspnoea \nexacerbated,   \npharyngolaryngeal \npain, \nepistaxis, \nsputum purulent, \nabnormal chest \nsound, \nincreased upper \nairway secretion \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDysgeusia Vomiting,  nausea  Diarrhoea, \ntoothache, \nsalivary \nhypersecretion, \nflatulence \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Arthralgia  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n  Proteinuria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Pyrexia, asthenia, \nfatigue \n\nThirst \n\nInvestigations  Forced expiratory \nvolume decreased \n\n \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n  Medication error \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn the 24-week clinical study, where Colobreathe was administered twice daily to adults and children \naged 6-17, the adverse reactions identified in the paediatric population were similar to that for the \noverall population. The most commonly reported adverse reactions as a percent of Colobreathe treated \npatients were: cough (55%), unpleasant taste (51%), throat irritation (34%), dyspnoea (10%) and \ndysphonia (10%). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nCurrently there is no experience of overdose with the use of Colobreathe.  However, overdose may \npossibly result in higher systemic exposure. \n \nOverdose is unlikely by the inhaled route but has been recognised after systemic use. More common \nsigns and symptoms of intravenous overdose include unsteadiness, paraesthesia and dizziness.  It can \nalso result in neuromuscular blockade that can lead to muscular weakness, apnoea and possible \nrespiratory arrest.  Overdose can also cause acute renal failure characterised by decreased urine output \nand increased serum concentrations of BUN and creatinine. \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote, therefore management should be done by supportive treatment. Measures \nto increase the rate of elimination of colistimethate sodium e.g. mannitol diuresis, prolonged \nhaemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be tried, but effectiveness is unknown. \n \n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, other antibacterials.  \nATC Code: J01XB01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nColistimethate sodium (CMS) is a cyclic polypeptide antibacterial active substance that is derived \nfrom Bacillus polymyxa var. colistinus and belongs to the polymyxin group.  Polymyxins work by \ndamaging the cell membrane and the resulting physiological effects are lethal to the bacterium.  \nPolymyxins are selective for Gram-negative bacteria that have a hydrophobic outer membrane. \n \nResistance \n \nResistant bacteria are characterised by modification of the phosphate groups of lipopolysaccharide, \nwhich become substituted with ethanolamine or aminoarabinose.  Naturally resistant Gram-negative \nbacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Burkholderia cepacia, show complete substitution of their lipid \nphosphate by ethanolamine or aminoarabinose. \n \nCross resistance \n \nCross resistance between colistimethate sodium and polymyxin B is expected. Since the mechanism of \naction of the polymyxins is different from that of other antibacterial agents, resistance to colistin and \npolymyxin by the above mechanism alone would not be expected to result in resistance to other drug \nclasses.  \n \nThe epidemiological cut off value for colistimethate sodium for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, \ndistinguishing the wild type population from isolates with acquired resistance traits, is 4 mg/l. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe Phase 3 clinical study was a randomised, open-label active comparator study comparing the \nefficacy of colistimethate sodium 1,662,500 IU dry powder for inhalation to tobramycin nebuliser \nsolution for inhalation, 300 mg/5 ml, in 380 subjects with documented cystic fibrosis complicated by \nchronic pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The subjects were aged 6 years and \nabove and had an FEV1% predicted of 25-75%. All subjects were also required to have successfully \ncompleted a minimum of two cycles of nebulised tobramycin solution run-in prior to randomisation. \nSubjects were randomised to receive either one 1,662,500 IU capsule of colistimethate sodium twice \ndaily, or 300 mg of tobramycin, twice daily. It should be noted that treatment was not interrupted \nwhen patients received concomitant parenteral antibacterial active substances. \n \nEfficacy was measured by the change in FEV1 % predicted compared to baseline after a 24-week \ntreatment period.  \n \nThe results of the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population for the primary efficacy outcome are shown below: \n \nChange in FEV1 (% predicted) from baseline at Week 24 (ITT Population) \n\nPatient group Colobreathe \n( Mean) \n\nTobramycin  \n( Mean) \n\nAdjusted \nTreatment \ndifference \n\n95% CI \n\nAll patients \nusing LOCF \n\n-0.90 (n=183) 0.35  (n=190) -0.97 -2.74, 0.86 \n\nCompleted 0.39  (n=153) 0.78  (n=171) -0.29 -2.21, 1.71 \n\n\n\n8 \n\npatients \nThe data from the primary outcome parameter, change in FEV1 % predicted, are not normally distributed. The adjusted treatment difference \nand 95% confidence interval have been back transformed from log transformed data.  The ITT population excluded patients who had been \ntreated but demonstrated no evidence of chronic infection. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies \nwith Colobreathe  in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in Pseudomonas aeruginosa \npulmonary infection/colonisation in patients with cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nColistimethate is not significantly absorbed from the lung after inhalation of Colobreathe.  After \nadministration of 1,662, 500IU twice daily for 7 days in adult, adolescent and paediatric cystic fibrosis \npatients mean C max values of total colistimethate of up to 455ng/ml (adult mean) were observed.  Tmax for \ntotal colistimethate occurred between 0.5 and 1 hour post-dose. Although the population PK analysis \nshowed that age is a statistically significant covariate, the AUC 0-6 and dose adjusted AUC0-6 (AUC 0-6  /D) \nfor total CMS and total free colistin were similar between children and adolescents, while higher AUC 0-6  \nwas observed in the adult group. When AUC 0-6  was adjusted by dose and body weight, a slightly higher \nAUC 0-6 /D/W for total CMS and total free colistin was observed in children. High PK variability was \nobserved in all three groups. Therefore, dose adjustment in low age groups is considered not necessary. \n \nHigh concentrations of total free colistin (mean 23.5mg/L) and total colistimethate (mean 178mg/L) were \nobserved in sputum at 1 hour post-dose on Day 8 following BID dosing for 7 days across all age groups.  \n \nAbsorption of colistimethate from the gastro-intestinal tract does not occur to any appreciable extent in the \nnormal individual. \n \nDistribution \n \nProtein binding is low.  Polymyxins persist in the liver, kidney, brain, heart and muscle.  One study in \ncystic fibrosis patients gives the steady-state volume of distribution as 0.09 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nColistimethate sodium is converted to the base in vivo.  As 80% of a parenteral dose can be recovered \nunchanged in the urine, and there is no biliary excretion, it can be assumed that the remaining drug is \ninactivated in the tissues.  The mechanism is unknown. \n\n \nElimination \n \nA systemic absorption study showed minimal urinary excretion with less than 3% of the dose of \nColobreathe excreted in the urine as colistimethate sodium and colistin. Therefore, dose adjustment in \npatients with renal impairment is not considered necessary.  The estimated mean terminal half-lives for \ntotal CMS and total free colistin were 3.0 and 6.4 h, respectively.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity. \nAnimal studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or toxicity to reproduction, employing \nroutes assuring systemic exposure, showed no particular hazard.  There were no notable effects on \nfertility or general reproductive performance in male or female rats or mice.  In embryo-fetal \ndevelopment studies in mice, resorptions and reduced ossification were seen, and in rats reduced fetal \nweights, reduced ossification and at the high dose of 10 mg colistin base per day, reduced post-natal \n\n\n\n9 \n\nsurvival.  An embryo-fetal study in rabbits reported no effects at intravenous doses up to 80 mg/kg \ncolistimethate sodium (32 mg colistin base/kg).   \n\n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nComponents of the PEG-gelatin hard capsules: \n \nGelatin \nPolyethylene glycol \nPurified water \nSodium lauryl sulfate \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n3 years. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25°C. \n \nStore in the original package until immediately before use in order to protect from moisture. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \nThe capsules are contained in oPA/aluminium/pvc blisters with a peelable lidding foil composed of \npolyester/aluminium of either 8 or 14 hard capsules in each blister.   \n \nColobreathe is available in packs containing either 8 or 56 hard capsules. \n \nEach 56 capsule pack contains one Turbospin powder inhaler device and 7 blisters of 8 capsules or \none Turbospin powder inhaler device and 4 blisters of 14 capsules (56 hard capsules) sufficient for 4 \nweeks use.  \n \nEach 8 capsule pack contains one Turbospin powder inhaler device and 1 blister of 8 hard capsules \nsufficient for 4 days use. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling  \n \nCapsules: no special requirements for disposal.  The Turbospin device should be discarded after \ncompletion of the treatment pack. \n \nColobreathe capsules should only be administered using the Turbospin inhaler device.   \n \nTaking Colobreathe using the Turbospin inhaler \n \nThe following instructions should be adhered to by the patient when taking Colobreathe: \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n \nPreparing the Turbospin \n \n\n1. Remove the cap. It comes away with a gentle pull. \n2. Unscrew the mouthpiece, exposing the chamber of the Turbospin inhaler. \n3. Remove a single capsule from the blister pack. Once you have removed the capsule it must be \n\nused immediately. \n4. Gently insert the capsule into the chamber with the widest end first. No force is required.  \n5. Now replace the mouthpiece by screwing it back into place. \n\n \nPiercing the capsule and inhaling the medicine \n \n\n6. To pierce the capsule: \n• Hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece upright, gently push the piston upwards until the \n\nvisible line is reached – you will feel resistance at this point and this will lock the capsule in \nplace ready for piercing. Hold that position before continuing to follow through with the \npiercing. \n\n• Now, with the capsule locked in place, continue pushing the piston as far as it will go and \nthen release. \n\n• The capsule is now pierced and the contents can be inhaled. \n• Do not pierce the capsule more than once. You may see a small amount of powder released \n\nfrom the capsule chamber after the capsule is pierced, this is normal. \n7. Breathe out slowly. Place the mouthpiece between your lips and teeth. Ensure there is a seal \n\nbetween your lips and the mouthpiece. Take care not to cover the air slits with your fingers or \nmouth during inhalation.  \n\n8. Then, breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth at a rate sufficient for you to hear or \nfeel the capsule spinning.   \n\n9. Remove the Turbospin inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds or \nfor as long as is comfortable, then breathe out slowly.   \n\n10. If you do not hear the capsule spinning, the capsule may be stuck in the compartment.  If this \noccurs, you can loosen the capsule by gently tapping the chamber of the inhaler. Do not try to \nloosen the capsule by repeatedly pressing the piston.  If the capsule cannot be loosened and \nthe powder cannot be inhaled, dispose of the broken capsule and any powder remaining in it \nand use another. \n\n11. Inhale the medicine again by repeating Steps 7 and 8 to ensure you have emptied the capsule. \n12. You can check whether the capsule is empty by unscrewing the mouthpiece and checking the \n\ncapsule. If it is not empty, repeat steps 7, 8 and 9 until you have inhaled all of the contents.  \n13. Once all the contents have been inhaled, rinse your mouth out well with water and spit out. \n\n \nRemoving the empty capsule from the Turbospin \n \n\n14. When the capsule is empty, unscrew the mouthpiece, then remove and discard the empty \ncapsule.   \n\n \nAdditional information  \n \nAs you breathe in slowly, you suck air through the body of the Turbospin inhaler into the capsule \nchamber. The tiny particles of medicine in the capsule are picked up by the airflow and carried down \nyour airway into your lungs. \n \nOccasionally, very small pieces of the capsule shell can get into your mouth or airways.  \n• If this happens, you may be able to feel these pieces on your tongue or in your airways.  \n• The capsule shell is made of gelatin, which is harmless to humans if swallowed or inhaled. \n• The chances of the capsule breaking into pieces are increased if the capsule is pierced more than \n\nonce during Step 6. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nColobreathe 1,662,500 IU inhalation powder, hard capsules \nColistimethate sodium \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.   \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Colobreathe is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Colobreathe \n3. How to use Colobreathe \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Colobreathe \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Colobreathe is and what it is used for \n \nColobreathe contains colistimethate sodium, a type of antibiotic called a polymyxin.  \n \nColobreathe is used to control persistent lung infections caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas \naeruginosa in adult patients and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis.  Pseudomonas \naeruginosa is a very common bacterium that infects nearly all cystic fibrosis patients at some time \nduring their lives. Some people will get this infection whilst very young but for others it will be much \nlater. If this infection is not properly controlled it will cause damage to the lungs.  \n \nHow it works \nColobreathe works by destroying the bacterial cell membrane, having a lethal effect on them.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Colobreathe \n \nDo not use Colobreathe: \n• if you/your child are allergic to colistimethate sodium, colistin sulphate or polymyxins. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTell your doctor if you/your child has ever had any of the following conditions: \n\n• have reacted badly to inhaled dry powder medicines previously unless this has already been \ndiscussed with your doctor. \n\n• already have a muscle condition known as myasthenia gravis or the inherited condition,  \nporphyria \n\n• blood in your sputum (the substance you cough up) \n \nAfter each inhalation of Colobreathe, the mouth should be rinsed with water.  The rinse should not be \nswallowed.  Rinsing may reduce the risk of developing oral fungal super-infection during treatment \nand may also reduce the unpleasant taste associated with colistimethate sodium. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nWhen you/your child start using Colobreathe, you/your child may find they have cough, \nbreathlessness, tightness of chest or wheezing. The number of these side-effects may reduce as you \ncontinue to use the inhaler or your doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator to use before or after taking \nColobreathe. If any of these effects become a problem, please contact your doctor who may change \nyour treatment. \n \nIf you/your child has any problems with your kidneys or nerves, care should be taken when \nadministering Colobreathe but your doctor should be aware of this. \n \nIf you/your child needs to have other forms of colistimethate either by injection or nebulisation \ncaution should be used but your doctor should be aware of this. \n \nChildren \nDo not give Colobreathe to children under the age of 6 years as it is not suitable for them. \n \nOther medicines and Colobreathe \nTell your doctor if you/your child are taking, have recently taken or might use any other medicines, \nand in particular: \n\n  \n• if you/your child are taking aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat infections caution must be \n\ntaken; \n• if you/your child suffer from myasthenia gravis and are taking macrolide type antibiotics such \n\nas azithromycin and clarithromycin, or fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin and \nciprofloxacin.  Taking these at the same time as Colobreathe may cause problems with muscle \nweakness; \n\n• if you/your child are taking colistimethate by injection or nebulisation caution must be taken; \n• if you/your child need to have a general anaesthetic caution must be taken. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nThere is no information about the safety of Colobreathe in pregnant women. Your doctor should \nadvise you before using Colobreathe whether the benefits of the medicine exceed the risks. \n \nColistimethate sodium may be secreted in the breast milk. Please discuss the use of Colobreathe with \nyour doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is possible while using Colobreathe that you may experience dizziness, confusion or have problems \nwith your sight. Do not drive or use any machines until the symptoms have gone away. \n \n \n3. How to use Colobreathe \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you/your \nchild are not sure. \n \nThe first dose should be given under medical supervision. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \nDosage \n \nAdults and children 6 years of age and older \n \n\n• The contents of one Colobreathe capsule should be inhaled twice a day using the Turbospin \ninhaler. \n\n• There should be a 12 hour gap between doses. \n \nThe order in which other treatments should be taken or carried out \nIf you/your child are taking other treatments for cystic fibrosis you/your child should take them in the \nfollowing order: \n\n• Inhaled bronchodilators \n• Chest physiotherapy  \n• Other inhaled medicines \n• Then Colobreathe  \n \n\nYou/your child should confirm the order of your treatments with your doctor. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nColobreathe is inhaled into the lungs as a powder from the capsule using the hand-held inhaler called \nthe Turbospin. Colobreathe can only be administered using this device. \n \nDo not swallow Colobreathe capsules.  \n \nTo inhale Colobreathe from the capsule through the Turbospin inhaler follow the procedure described \nbelow. Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse should show you/your child how to inhale the medicine when \nyou/your child first start treatment: \n \nTaking Colobreathe using the Turbospin inhaler \n \nPreparing the Turbospin \n \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n \n\n1. Remove the cap. It comes away with a gentle pull. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n2. Unscrew the mouthpiece, exposing the chamber of the Turbospin inhaler. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n3. Remove a single capsule from the blister. Once you have removed the capsule it must be used \nimmediately. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n4. Gently insert the capsule into the chamber with the widest end first. No force is required.  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n5. Now replace the mouthpiece by screwing it back into place. \n \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPiercing the capsule and inhaling the medicine \n \n\n \n \n \n\n6. To pierce the capsule: \n• Hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece upright, gently push the piston upwards until the \n\nvisible line is reached – you will feel resistance at this point and this will lock the capsule \nin place ready for piercing. Hold that position before continuing to follow through with \nthe piercing. \n\n• Now, with the capsule locked in place, continue pushing the piston as far as it will go and \nthen release. \n\n• The capsule is now pierced and the contents can be inhaled. \n• Do not pierce the capsule more than once. You may see a small amount of powder \n\nreleased from the capsule chamber after the capsule is pierced, this is normal. \n \n\n \n \n\n7. Breathe out slowly.  Place the mouthpiece between your lips and teeth. Ensure there is a seal \nbetween your lips and the mouthpiece. Take care not to cover the air slits with your fingers or \nmouth during inhalation.  \n\n8. Then, breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth at a rate sufficient for you to hear or \nfeel the capsule spinning.   \n\n9. Remove the Turbospin inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds or \nfor as long as is comfortable, then breathe out slowly.   \n\n10. If you do not hear the capsule spinning, the capsule may be stuck in the compartment.  If this \noccurs, you can loosen the capsule by gently tapping the chamber of the inhaler. Do not try to \nloosen the capsule by repeatedly pressing the piston.  If the capsule cannot be loosened and \nthe powder cannot be inhaled, dispose of the broken capsule and any powder remaining in it \nand use another. \n\n11. Inhale the medicine again by repeating Steps 7 and 8 to ensure you have emptied the capsule. \n12. You can check whether the capsule is empty by unscrewing the mouthpiece and checking the \n\ncapsule. If it is not empty, repeat steps 7, 8 and 9 until you have inhaled all of the contents.  \n13. Once all the contents have been inhaled, rinse your mouth out well with water and spit out. \n\n \nRemoving the empty capsule from the Turbospin \n \n\n14. When the capsule is empty, unscrew the mouthpiece, then remove and discard the empty \ncapsule.   \n\n \nAdditional information  \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nAs you breathe in slowly, you suck air through the body of the Turbospin inhaler into the capsule \nchamber. The tiny particles of medication in the capsule are picked up by the airflow and carried down \nyour airway into your lungs. \n \nOccasionally, very small pieces of the capsule shell can get into your mouth or airways.  \n• If this happens, you may be able to feel these pieces on your tongue or in your airways.  \n• The capsule shell is made of gelatin, which is harmless to humans if swallowed or inhaled. \n• The chances of the capsule breaking into pieces are increased if the capsule is pierced more than \n\nonce during Step 6. \n \nCleaning the Turbospin device \n \nClean the Turbospin inhaler after each dose using the following procedure: \n\n1. Deeply press the piston a few times whilst keeping the chamber turned upside down. \n2. Clean the chamber using a tissue or cotton bud. Do not use water. \n3. Screw the mouthpiece firmly back into place, put the cap back on and the inhaler is ready to \n\nbe used for your next dose.   \n \nIf you/your child use more Colobreathe than you/your child should, or have accidentally \nswallowed the capsule, contact your doctor immediately for advice. \n \nIf you/your child forget to use Colobreathe \n \nIf you/your child forget to take a dose of Colobreathe then you/your child should take your missed \ndose as soon as you/your child remember. You/your child must not take 2 doses within 12 hours. \nCarry on from there as instructed. \n \nIf you/your child stop using Colobreathe \n \nDo not stop your treatment early unless your doctor says you can.
