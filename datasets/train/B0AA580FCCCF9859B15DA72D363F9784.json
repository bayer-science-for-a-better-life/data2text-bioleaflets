During infusion, the rate should be \n\nincreased every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 ml/h (see section 6.6). If an infusion-related ADR is \n\nobserved during infusion, see below section \u201cDose modification and reinitiation of therapy after \n\ninfusion-related ADRs\u201d. \n\n \n\nSubsequent infusions \n\nIf the preceding infusion(s) has (have) been completed without severe infusion related ADRs, the \n\nsubsequent infusions can start at a rate of 25 ml/h and should be increased every 30 minutes up to a \n\nmaximum of 400 ml/h (see section 6.6). If an infusion-related ADR is observed during infusion, see \n\nbelow section \u201cDose modification and reinitiation of therapy after infusion-related ADRs\u201d. \n\n \n\nDose modification and reinitiation of therapy after infusion-related ADRs \n\nIn the event of a mild or moderate ADR, the infusion should be interrupted and restarted at half of the \n\ninfusion rate at the time of interruption once the patient\u2019s condition is stable. If the infusion rate had \n\nnot been increased from the starting rate of 12 ml/hour prior to interrupting due to an ADR, the \n\ninfusion should be restarted at 12 ml/hour, the standard starting infusion rate. The infusion rate can \n\ncontinue to be increased according to standard procedures, to physician discretion and to patient \n\ntolerance (not to exceed doubling the rate every 30 minutes). \n\n \n\nIn the event of a severe ADR, the infusion should be interrupted and restarted at 12 ml/hour when the \n\npatient\u2019s condition is stable. The infusion rate can continue to be increased according to standard \n\nprocedures, to physician discretion and to patient tolerance (not to exceed increasing the rate every \n\n30 minutes). \n\n \n\nArzerra should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction to the \n\nmedicinal product. \n\n \n\nRefractory CLL \n\nThe recommended dose and schedule is 12 doses administered as follows: \n\n\uf0b7 300 mg on day 1 followed 1 week later by \n\n\uf0b7 2000 mg weekly for 7 doses (infusions 2 to 8) followed 4-5 weeks later by \n\n\uf0b7 2000 mg every 28 days for 4 doses (infusions 9 to 12) \n \n\nFirst and second infusions \n\nThe initial rate of the first and second infusion of Arzerra should be 12 ml/hour. During infusion, the \n\nrate should be increased every 30 minutes to a maximum of 200 ml/hour (see section 6.6). If an \n\ninfusion-related ADR is observed during an infusion, see below section \u201cDose modification and \n\nreinitiation of therapy after infusion-related ADRs\u201d. \n\n \n\nSubsequent infusions \n\nIf the preceding infusion(s) has (have) been completed without severe infusion-related ADRs, the \n\nsubsequent infusions can start at a rate of 25 ml/hour and should be increased every 30 minutes up to a \n\nmaximum of 400 ml/hour (see section 6.6).

The infusion rate can continue to be increased according to standard \n\nprocedures, to physician discretion and to patient tolerance (not to exceed increasing the rate every \n\n30 minutes). \n\n \n\nArzerra should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction to the \n\nmedicinal product. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Arzerra in children aged below 18 years have not been established. Arzerra \n\nis therefore not recommended for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo substantial differences related to age were seen in safety and efficacy (see section 5.1). Based on \n\navailable safety and efficacy data in the elderly, no dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo formal studies of Arzerra in patients with renal impairment have been performed. No dose \n\nadjustment is recommended for mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance >30 ml/min) \n\n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo formal studies of Arzerra in patients with hepatic impairment have been performed. However, \n\npatients with hepatic impairment are unlikely to require dose modification (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nArzerra is for intravenous infusion and must be diluted prior to administration. For instructions on \n\ndilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to ofatumumab or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\n \n\nIntravenous ofatumumab has been associated with infusion-related reactions. These reactions may \n\nresult in temporary interruption or withdrawal of treatment. Pre-medication attenuates infusion-related \n\nreactions but these may still occur, predominantly during the first infusion. Infusion-related reactions \n\nmay include, but are not limited to, anaphylactoid events, bronchospasm, cardiac events (e.g. \n\nmyocardial ischaemia/infarction, bradycardia), chills/rigors, cough, cytokine release syndrome, \n\ndiarrhoea, dyspnoea, fatigue, flushing, hypertension, hypotension, nausea, pain, pulmonary oedema, \n\npruritus, pyrexia, rash, and urticaria. In rare cases, these reactions may lead to death. Even with pre-\n\nmedication, severe reactions, including cytokine release syndrome, have been reported following use \n\nof ofatumumab. In the event of a severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion of Arzerra must be \n\ninterrupted immediately and symptomatic treatment instituted (see section 4.2). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nIf an anaphylactic reaction occurs, Arzerra should be immediately and permanently discontinued and \n\nappropriate medical treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions occur predominantly during the first infusion and tend to decrease with \n\nsubsequent infusions. Patients with a history of decreased pulmonary function may be at a greater risk \n\nfor pulmonary complications from severe reactions and should be monitored closely during infusion of \n\nArzerra. \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \n\n \n\nIn patients with CLL, tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur with use of Arzerra. Risk factors for \n\nTLS include a high tumour burden, high concentrations of circulating cells (\u226525,000/mm3), \n\nhypovolaemia, renal insufficiency, elevated pre-treatment uric acid levels and elevated lactate \n\ndehydrogenase levels. Management of TLS includes correction of electrolyte abnormalities, \n\nmonitoring of renal function, maintenance of fluid balance and supportive care. \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n\n \n\nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in death have been reported in \n\nCLL patients receiving cytotoxic pharmacotherapy, including ofatumumab. A diagnosis of PML \n\nshould be considered in any Arzerra patient who reports the new onset of or changes in pre-existing \n\nneurological signs and symptoms. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected Arzerra should be discontinued \n\nand referral to a neurologist should be considered. \n\n \n\nImmunisations \n\n \n\nThe safety of, and ability to generate a primary or anamnestic response to, immunisation with live \n\nattenuated or inactivated vaccines during treatment with ofatumumab has not been studied. The \n\nresponse to vaccination could be impaired when B-cells are depleted. Due to the risk of infection, \n\nadministration of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and after treatment with \n\nofatumumab, until B-cell counts are normalised. The risks and benefits of vaccinating patients during \n\nArzerra therapy should be considered. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B \n\n \n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, \n\nhepatic failure and death, has occurred in patients treated with medicinal products classified as CD20-\n\ndirected cytolytic antibodies, including Arzerra. Cases have been reported in patients who are hepatitis \n\nB surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in those who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) \n\npositive but HBsAg negative. Reactivation has also occurred in patients who appear to have resolved \n\nhepatitis B infection (i.e. HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive, and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-\n\nHBs] positive). \n\n \n\nHBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase \n\nin serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative \n\nand anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e. increase in \n\ntransaminase levels and, in severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death. \n\n \n\nAll patients should be screened for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before \n\ninitiation of Arzerra treatment. For patients who show evidence of prior (HBsAg negative, anti-HBc \n\npositive) hepatitis B infection, physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B should be consulted \n\nregarding monitoring and initiation of HBV antiviral therapy. Arzerra treatment should not be initiated \n\nin patients with evidence of current hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive) until the infection has been \n\nadequately treated. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nPatients with evidence of prior HBV infection should be monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of \n\nhepatitis or HBV reactivation during treatment with and for 6-12 months following the last infusion of \n\nArzerra. HBV reactivation has been reported up to 12 months following completion of therapy. \n\nDiscontinuation of HBV antiviral therapy should be discussed with physicians with expertise in \n\nmanaging hepatitis B. \n\n \n\nIn patients who develop reactivation of HBV while receiving Arzerra, Arzerra and any concomitant \n\nchemotherapy should be interrupted immediately, and appropriate treatment instituted. Insufficient \n\ndata exist regarding the safety of resuming Arzerra in patients who develop HBV reactivation. \n\nResumption of Arzerra in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with \n\nphysicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely. Arzerra should be discontinued \n\nin patients who experience serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n \n\nThe effect of multiple doses of Arzerra on the QTc interval was evaluated in a pooled analysis of three \n\nopen-label studies in patients with CLL (N=85). Increases above 5 msec were observed in the \n\nmedian/mean QT/QTc intervals in the pooled analysis. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e. \n\n>20 milliseconds) were detected. None of the patients had an increase of QTc to >500 msec. A \n\nconcentration-dependent increase in QTc was not detected. It is recommended that patients have \n\nelectrolytes such as potassium and magnesium measured prior to and during the administration of \n\nofatumumab. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. The effect of ofatumumab on patients \n\nwith prolonged QT intervals (e.g. acquired or congenital) is unknown. \n\n \n\nBowel obstruction \n\n \n\nBowel obstruction has been reported in patients receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy, \n\nincluding ofatumumab. Patients who present with abdominal pain, especially early in the course of \n\nofatumumab therapy, should be evaluated and appropriate treatment instituted. \n\n \n\nLaboratory monitoring \n\n \n\nCytopenias, including prolonged and late-onset neutropenia, have been reported during ofatumumab \n\ntherapy. Complete blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be obtained at \n\nregular intervals during Arzerra therapy and more frequently in patients who develop cytopenias. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 34.8 mg sodium per 300 mg dose, 116 mg sodium per 1000 mg dose \n\nand 232 mg sodium per 2000 mg dose. This should be taken into consideration by patients on a \n\ncontrolled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nAlthough limited formal drug-drug interaction data exist for ofatumumab, there are no known \n\nclinically significant interactions with other medicinal products. No clinically relevant \n\npharmacokinetic interactions were observed between ofatumumab and fludarabine, \n\ncyclophosphamide,bendamustine, chlorambucil, or its active metabolite, phenylacetic acid mustard. \n\n \n\nLive attenuated or inactivated vaccine efficacy may be impaired with ofatumumab. Therefore, the \n\nconcomitant use of these agents with ofatumumab should be avoided. If the coadministration is judged \n\nunavoidable, the risks and benefits of vaccinating patients during therapy with ofatumumab should be \n\nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential \n\n \n\nSince ofatumumab may cause foetal B-cell depletion, effective contraception (methods that result in \n\nless than 1% pregnancy rates) has to be used during Arzerra therapy and for 12 months after the last \n\nArzerra dose. After this period, planning of a pregnancy in relation to the underlying disease, should \n\nbe evaluated by the treating physician. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nOfatumumab may cause foetal B-cell depletion based on findings from animal studies and on its \n\nmechanism of action (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women to inform a product-associated \n\nrisk. No teratogenicity or maternal toxicity were observed in an animal reproduction study with \n\nadministration of ofatumumab to pregnant monkeys (see section 5.3). Ofatumumab should not be \n\nadministered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risk \n\nto the foetus. \n\n \n\nAdministration of live vaccines to neonates and infants exposed to ofatumumab in utero should be \n\navoided until B-cell recovery occurs (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether Arzerra is excreted in human milk, however human IgG is secreted in human \n\nmilk. The safe use of ofatumumab in humans during lactation has not been established. The excretion \n\nof ofatumumab in milk has not been studied in animals. Published data suggest that neonatal and \n\ninfant consumption of breast milk does not result in substantial absorption of these maternal antibodies \n\ninto circulation. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued \n\nduring treatment with Arzerra and for 12 months following treatment. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the effects of ofatumumab on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility \n\nhave not been evaluated in animal studies. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effects of Arzerra on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\nNo detrimental effects on such activities are predicted from the pharmacology of ofatumumab. The \n\nclinical status of the patient and the ADR profile of ofatumumab should be borne in mind when \n\nconsidering the patient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe overall safety profile of ofatumumab is based on data from 1,168 patients in clinical trials in CLL \n\n(see section 5.1). This includes 643 patients treated with ofatumumab as monotherapy (in patients with \n\nrelapsed or refractory CLL) and 525 patients treated with ofatumumab in combination with \n\nchemotherapy (chlorambucil or bendamustine or fludarabine and cyclophosphamide). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions reported in patients treated with ofatumumab as monotherapy and with ofatumumab \n\nin combination with chemotherapy, are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by \n\nfrequency, using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from available data).

These included bacterial, viral and fungal infections. 268 (23%) of the 1,168 patients \n\nexperienced \u2265Grade 3 infections. 65 (6%) of the 1,168 patients experienced a fatal infection. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia \n\nOf the 1,168 patients receiving ofatumumab in clinical trials, 420 patients (36%) experienced an \n\nadverse event associated with a decreased neutrophil count; 129 (11%) experienced a serious adverse \n\nevent associated with a decreased neutrophil count. \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal study for untreated CLL (OMB110911; ofatumumab plus chlorambucil 217 patients, \n\nchlorambucil alone 227 patients), prolonged neutropenia (defined as Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia not \n\nresolved between 24 and 42 days after last dose of study treatment) was reported in 41 patients (9%) \n\n(23 patients [11%] treated with ofatumumab and chlorambucil, 18 patients [8%] treated with \n\nchlorambucil alone). Nine patients (4%) treated with ofatumumab and chlorambucil, and three patients \n\ntreated with chlorambucil alone had late-onset neutropenia (defined as Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia \n\nstarting at least 42 days after the last treatment). In the pivotal study (OMB110913, ofatumumab plus \n\nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide 181 patients; fludarabine and cyclophosphamide 178 patients) in \n\nrelapsed CLL patients, prolonged neutropenia was reported in 38 (11%) patients (18 patients [10%] \n\ntreated with ofatumumab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide compared to \n\n20 patients [11%] in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide arm). Thirteen (7%) patients treated with \n\nofatumumab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and 5 (3%) patients treated with \n\nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide had late-onset neutropenia. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\nThe effect of multiple doses of Arzerra on the QTc interval was evaluated in a pooled analysis of three \n\nopen-label studies in patients with CLL (N=85). Increases above 5 msec were observed in the \n\nmedian/mean QT/QTc intervals in the pooled analysis. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e. \n\n>20 milliseconds) were detected. None of the patients had an increase of QTc to >500 msec. A \n\nconcentration dependent increase in QTc was not detected. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplasic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC10 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nOfatumumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds specifically to a distinct epitope \n\nencompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The CD20 molecule \n\nis a transmembrane phosphoprotein expressed on B lymphocytes from the pre-B to mature B \n\nlymphocyte stage and on B-cell tumours. The B-cell tumours include CLL (generally associated with \n\nlower levels of CD20 expression) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (where >90% of tumours have high \n\nlevels of CD20 expression). The CD20 molecule is not shed from the cell surface and is not \n\ninternalised following antibody binding. \n\n \n\nThe binding of ofatumumab to the membrane-proximal epitope of the CD20 molecule induces \n\nrecruitment and activation of the complement pathway at the cell surface, leading to complement-\n\ndependent cytotoxicity and resultant lysis of tumour cells. Ofatumumab has been shown to induce \n\nappreciable lysis of cells with high expression levels of complement defence molecules. Ofatumumab \n\nhas also been shown to induce cell lysis in both high and low CD20 expressing cells and in rituximab-\n\nresistant cells. In addition, the binding of ofatumumab allows the recruitment of natural killer cells \n\nallowing the induction of cell death through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nPeripheral B-cell counts decreased after the first ofatumumab infusion in patients with haematological \n\nmalignancies. In all patients with CLL, ofatumumab induces rapid and profound B-cell depletion, \n\nwhether given as a single agent or in combination. \n\n \n\nWhen ofatumumab was administered as single agent in patients with refractory CLL, the median \n\ndecrease in B-cell counts was 22% after the first infusion and 92% at the eighth weekly infusion. \n\nPeripheral B-cell counts remained low throughout the remainder of therapy in most patients and \n\nremained below baseline up to 15 months after the last dose in patients who responded. \n\n \n\nWhen ofatumumab was administered in combination with chlorambucil in patients with previously \n\nuntreated CLL, the median decreases in B-cell counts after the first cycle and prior to the sixth \n\nmonthly cycle were 94% and >99%. At 6 months after the last dose, the median reductions in B-cell \n\ncounts were >99%. \n\n \n\nWhen ofatumumab was administered in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in \n\npatients with relapsed CLL, the median decrease from baseline was 60% after the first infusion and \n\ncomplete depletion (100%) was reached after 4 cycles. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nThere is a potential for immunogenicity with therapeutic proteins such as ofatumumab. Serum samples \n\nfrom more than 1,000 patients across the CLL clinical programme were tested for anti-ofatumumab \n\nantibodies during and after treatment periods ranging from 8 weeks to 2 years. Formation of \n\nanti-ofatumumab antibodies was observed for less than 0.5% of patients with CLL after treatment with \n\nofatumumab. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated CLL \n\nStudy OMB110911 (randomised, open-label, parallel-arm, multicentre) evaluated the efficacy of \n\nArzerra in combination with chlorambucil compared with chlorambucil alone in 447 patients with \n\npreviously untreated CLL considered inappropriate for fludarabine-based treatment (e.g. due to \n\nadvanced age or presence of co-morbidities), with active disease and indicated for treatment. Patients \n\nreceived either Arzerra as monthly intravenous infusions (cycle 1: 300 mg on day 1 and 1000 mg on \n\nday 8; subsequent cycles: 1000 mg on day 1 every 28 days) in combination with chlorambucil \n\n(10 mg/m2 orally on days 1-7 every 28 days) or chlorambucil alone (10 mg/m2 orally on days 1-7 every \n\n28 days). Patients received treatment for a minimum of 3 months until best response or up to a \n\nmaximum of 12 cycles. The median age was 69 years (range: 35 to 92 years), 27% patients were \n\n\u226575 years of age, 63% were male and 89% were white. Median Cumulative Illness Rating Score for \n\nGeriatrics (CIRS-G) was 9 and 31% of patients had a CIRS-G >10. Median creatinine clearance \n\n(CrCl), assessed with the use of the Cockroft-Gault formula, was 70 ml/min and 48% of patients had a \n\nCrCl of <70 ml/min. Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance \n\nstatus of 0 to 2 were enrolled into the study and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. \n\nApproximately 60% of patients received 3-6 cycles of Arzerra and 32% received 7-12 cycles. The \n\nmedian number of cycles completed in patients was 6 (total Arzerra dose of 6300 mg). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was median progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by a blinded \n\nIndependent Review Committee (IRC) using the International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic \n\nLeukaemia (IWCLL) updated National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) \n\nguidelines (2008). The overall response rate (ORR) including complete response (CR) was also \n\nassessed by an IRC using the 2008 IWCLL guidelines. \n\n \n\nArzerra in combination with chlorambucil showed a statistically significant (71%) improvement in \n\nmedian PFS compared with chlorambucil alone (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.72) (see Table 1 and \n\nFigure 1). PFS benefit with the addition of Arzerra was observed in all patients, including those with \n\npoor-risk biological features (such as 17p or 11q deletion, unmutated IGHV, \u03b22M >3500 \u03bcg/l, and \n\nZAP-70 expression). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 1 Summary of PFS with Arzerra in combination with chlorambucil compared with \n\nchlorambucil in previously untreated CLL \n\n \n\nIRC-assessed primary and \n\nsubgroup analyses of PFS, months \n\nChlorambucil \n\n \n\n(N=226) \n\nArzerra and \n\nchlorambucil \n\n(N=221) \n\nMedian, all patients 13.1 22.4 \n\n95% CI (10.6, 13.8) (19.0, 25.2) \n\nHazard ratio \n\nP value \n\n0.57 (0.45, 0.72) \n\np<0.001 \n\nAge \u226575 years (n=119) 12.2 23.8 \n\nCo-morbidity 0 or 1 (n=126) 10.9 23.0 \n\nCo-morbidity 2 or more (n=321) 13.3 21.9 \n\nECOG 0, 1 (n=411) 13.3 23.0 \n\nECOG 2 (n=35) 7.9 20.9 \n\nCIRS-G \u226410 (n=310) 13.1 21.7 \n\nCIRS-G >10 (n=137) 12.2 23.2 \n\nCrCl <70 ml/min (n=214) 10.9 23.1 \n\nCrCl \u226570 ml/min (n=227) 14.5 22.1 \n\n17p or 11q deletion (n=90) 7.9 13.6 \n\nIGHV mutated (\u226498%) (n=177) 12.2 30.5 \n\nIGHV unmutated (>98%) (n=227) 11.7  17.3 \n\n\u03b22M \u22643500 \u03bcg/l (n=109) 13.8 25.5 \n\n\u03b22M >3500 \u03bcg/l (n=322) 11.6 19.6 \n\nZAP-70 positive (n=161) 9.7 17.7 \n\nZAP-70 intermediate (n=160) 13.6 25.3 \n\nZAP-70 negative (n=100) 13.8 25.6 \n\nIGHV mutated & ZAP-70 negative \n\n(n=60) \n10.5 NR \n\nIGHV mutated & ZAP-70 positive \n\n(n=35) \n7.9 27.2 \n\nIGHV unmutated & ZAP-70 negative \n\n(n=27) \n16.7 16.2 \n\nIGHV unmutated & ZAP-70 positive \n\n(n=122) \n11.2 16.2 \n\nAbbreviations: \u03b22M = beta-2-microglobulin, CI = confidence interval; CIRS-G = Cumulative \n\nIllness Rating Scale for Geriatrics, CLL = chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, CrCl = creatinine \n\nclearance, ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, IGHV = Immunoglobulin Heavy \n\nChain Variable Region, IRC = Independent Review Committee, N = number, NR = not reached, \n\nPFS = progression-free survival, ZAP-70 = zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70. \n\n \n\nLimited data are available in the heterogeneous non-white population and in patients with an ECOG \n\nperformance status of PS = 2. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\n------Chlorambucil (N=226) \n\nMedian 13.1 \n\nmonths____Ofatumumab + \n\nChlorambucil  (N=221) \n\nMedian 22.4 months \n\n \n\nHazard Ratio=0.57 \n\n95% CI (0.45, 0.72) \n\np-value<0.001 \n\n \n\nNumber at risks at \nRisk: \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier estimates of IRC-assessed PFS in previously untreated CLL \n\n \n\n \n\n1.0 \n \n\n0.9 \n \n\n0.8 \n \n\n0.7 \n \n\n0.6 \n \n\n0.5 \n \n\n0.4 \n \n\n0.3 \n \n\n0.2 \n \n\n0.1 \n \n\n0.0 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                   \n\n \n\nTime of Progression-free Survival (Months) \n\n \n\nTable 2 Summary of secondary outcomes of Arzerra in combination with chlorambucil \n\ncompared with chlorambucil in previously untreated CLL \n\n \n\nIRC-assessed secondary outcome Chlorambucil \n\n \n\n(N=226) \n\nArzerra and \n\nchlorambucil \n\n(N=221) \n\nORR (%) 69 82 \n\n95% CI (62.1, 74.6) (76.7, 87.1) \n\nP value p<0.001 \n\nCR (%) 1 12 \n\nCR with MRD negativity (% of CR) 0 37 \n\nMedian duration of response, all patients, \n\nmonths \n13.2 22.1 \n\n95% CI (10.8, 16.4) (19.1, 24.6) \n\nP value p<0.001 \n\nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval, CLL = chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, CR = complete \n\nresponse, IRC = Independent Review Committee, MRD = minimal residue disease, N = number, \n\nORR = overall response rate \n\n \n\nStudy OMB115991 evaluated the efficacy of Arzerra in combination with bendamustine in 44 patients \n\nwith previously untreated CLL considered inappropriate for fludarabine-based treatment.

Treatment with Arzerra (when given as 4 once-weekly infusions), led to a 50% objective \n\nresponse rate in the highest dose group (1st dose: 500 mg; 2nd, 3rd and 4th dose: 2,000 mg) and \n\nincluded 12 partial remissions and one nodular partial remission. For the highest dose group, the \n\nmedian time to progression was 15.6 weeks (95% CI: 15,22.6) in the full analysis population, and \n\n23 weeks (CI: 20,31) in responders. The duration of response was 16 weeks (CI: 13, 19) and the time \n\nto next CLL therapy was 52.4 weeks (CI: 36.9 \u2013 non-estimable). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nArzerra in all subsets of the paediatric population in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (see section 4.2 \n\nfor information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nOverall, the pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab were consistent across the indications, whether given as \n\na single agent or in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil. \n\nOfatumumab had non-linear pharmacokinetics related to its decreasing clearance over time. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nArzerra is administered by intravenous infusion; therefore, absorption is not applicable. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nOfatumumab has a small volume of distribution, with mean Vss values ranging from 1.7 to 8.1 l across \n\nstudies, dose levels, and infusion number. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nOfatumumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides \n\nand individual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. Classical biotransformation studies \n\nhave not been performed. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nOfatumumab is eliminated in two ways: a target-independent route like other IgG molecules and a \n\ntarget-mediated route which is related to binding to B-cells. There was a rapid and sustained depletion \n\nof CD20+ B-cells after the first ofatumumab infusion, leaving a reduced number of CD20+ cells \n\navailable for the antibody to bind at subsequent infusions. As a result, ofatumumab clearance values \n\nwere lower and t\u00bd values were significantly larger after later infusions than after the initial infusion; \n\nduring repeated weekly infusions, ofatumumab AUC and Cmax values increased more than the \n\nexpected accumulation based on first infusion data. \n\n \n\nThe main pharmacokinetic parameters of ofatumumab as a single agent or in combination are \n\nsummarised in Table 5. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nTable 5 Ofatumumab pharmacokinetic parameters (geometric mean) \n\n \n\nPopulation (treatment) Dosing \n\nregimen  \n\nCycle(1) Cmax \n\n(\u00b5g/ml) \n\nAUC \n\n(\u00b5g.h/ml) \n\nCL \n\n(ml/h) \n\nt\u00bd \n\n(days) \n\nRefractory CLL \n\n(ofatumumab) \n\n1st infusion \n\n(300 mg)  \n\nCycle 1 61.4    \n\n2000 mg: \n\n8 weekly \n\ninfusions \n\nfollowed by \n\n4 monthly \n\ninfusions \n\n12th dose 827 166000 12.1 11.5 \n\nPreviously untreated \n\npatients \n\n(ofatumumab + \n\nchlorambucil) \n\n1st infusion \n\n(300 mg) \n\nCycle 1 51.8 2620   \n\n1000 mg \n\nmonthly \n\ninfusions \n\nCycle 4 285 65100 15.4  18.5 \n\nRelapsed CLL \n\n(ofatumumab + FC) \n\n1st infusion \n\n(300 mg) \n\nCycle 1 61.4 3560   \n\n1000 mg on \n\nthe 8th day of \n\ncycle 1 \n\nfollowed by \n\n1000 mg \n\nmonthly \n\ninfusions \n\nCycle 4 313 89100 11.2 19.9 \n\n(1) Cycle for which the pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in this table. \n\nCmax = maximum ofatumumab concentration at the end of infusion, AUC = exposure to ofatumumab \n\nover a dosing period, CL = ofatumumab clearance after multiple doses, T\u00bd = terminal half-life \n\nNumbers rounded to three significant digits \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly (\u226565 years of age) \n\nAge was not found to be a significant factor for ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in a cross-study \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of patients ranging in age from 21 to 87 years of age. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in paediatric patients. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nGender had a modest effect (12%) on ofatumumab central volume of distribution in a cross-study \n\npopulation analysis, with higher Cmax and AUC values observed in female patients (48% of the \n\npatients in this analysis were male and 52% were female); these effects are not considered clinically \n\nrelevant, and no dose adjustment is recommended. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nBaseline calculated creatinine clearance was not found to be a significant factor on ofatumumab \n\npharmacokinetics in a cross-study population analysis in patients with calculated creatinine clearance \n\nvalues ranging from 26 to 287 ml/min. No dose adjustment is recommended for mild to moderate \n\nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance >30 ml/min). There are limited pharmacokinetic data in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo formal studies were conducted to examine the effect of hepatic impairment. IgG1 molecules such \n\nas ofatumumab are catabolised by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes, which are not restricted to hepatic \n\ntissue; therefore, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of \n\nofatumumab. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nPreclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans. \n\n \n\nIntravenous and subcutaneous administration to monkeys resulted in the expected depletion of \n\nperipheral and lymphoid tissue B-cell counts with no associated toxicological findings. As anticipated, \n\na reduction in the IgG humoral immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin was noted, but there \n\nwere no effects on delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. In a few animals, increased red cell \n\ndestruction occurred, presumably as a result of monkey anti-drug antibodies coating the red cells. A \n\ncorresponding increase in reticulocyte counts seen in these monkeys was indicative of a regenerative \n\nresponse in the bone marrow. \n\n \n\nIntravenous administration of ofatumumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys at 100 mg/kg once \n\nweekly from days 20 to 50 of gestation did not elicit maternal or foetal toxicity or teratogenicity. At \n\nthe end of organogenesis (day 48 of gestation), the ofatumumab exposure (AUCinf) corresponded to \n\n0.46 to 3.6 times the human exposure after the eighth infusion of the maximum recommended human \n\ndose (MRHD) of 2000 mg. At day 100 of gestation, depletion of B-cells relating to the \n\npharmacological activity of ofatumumab were observed in foetal cord blood and foetal splenic tissues. \n\nSpleen weights decreased by approximately 15% in the low-dose group and by approximately 30% in \n\nthe high-dose group, compared with control values. Pre- and post-natal development studies have not \n\nbeen performed. Post-natal recovery has therefore not been demonstrated. \n\n \n\nAs ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been \n\nconducted with ofatumumab. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Arzerra is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nArzerra contains ofatumumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. \n\n \n\nArzerra is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). CLL is a cancer of the blood which \n\naffects a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. The lymphocytes multiply too quickly and live \n\ntoo long, so there are too many of them circulating in your blood. The disease can also affect other \n\norgans in your body. The antibody in Arzerra recognises a substance on the surface of lymphocytes \n\nand causes the lymphocyte to die. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Arzerra \n\n \n\nYou must not be given Arzerra: \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to ofatumumab or any of the other ingredients of this \nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\nCheck with your doctor if you think this may apply to you. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Arzerra: \n\n\uf0b7 if you have had heart problems, \n\n\uf0b7 if you have lung disease, \nCheck with your doctor if you think any of these may apply to you. You may need extra check-ups \n\nwhile you are being treated with Arzerra. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may test the amount of electrolytes, such as magnesium and potassium, in your blood \n\nbefore and during your treatment with Arzerra. Your doctor may treat you if any electrolyte imbalance \n\nis detected. \n\n \n\nVaccination and Arzerra \n\nIf you are having any vaccinations tell your doctor, or the person giving you the vaccine, that you are \n\nbeing treated with Arzerra. Your response to the vaccine may be weakened and you may not be fully \n\nprotected. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\nHepatitis B \n\nYou should be tested for hepatitis B (a liver disease) before starting Arzerra treatment. If you have had \n\nhepatitis B, Arzerra could cause it to become active again. Your doctor may treat you with a suitable \n\nanti-viral medicine to help prevent this. \n\n \n\nIf you have or have had hepatitis B, tell your doctor before you are given Arzerra. \n\n \n\nInfusion reactions \n\nMedicines of this type (monoclonal antibodies) can cause infusion reactions when they are injected \n\ninto the body. You will be given medicines such as anti-histamines, steroids or pain relievers to help \n\nreduce any reaction. See also section 4, \u2018Possible side effects\u2019. \n\n \n\nIf you think you have had such a reaction before, tell your doctor before you are given Arzerra. \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious and life-threatening brain condition, has \n\nbeen reported with medicines like Arzerra. Tell your doctor immediately if you have memory loss, \n\ntrouble thinking, difficulty with walking or loss of vision. If you had these symptoms prior to \n\ntreatment with Arzerra, tell your doctor immediately about any changes in these symptoms. \n\n \n\nBowel obstruction \n\nContact your doctor immediately if you experience constipation, a swollen abdomen or abdominal \n\npain. These could be symptoms of a blockage in the bowel, especially during the early stages of your \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nIt is not known whether Arzerra works in children and adolescents. Therefore Arzerra is not \n\nrecommended for use in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Arzerra \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\nThis includes herbal medicines and other medicines you can obtain without a prescription. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nArzerra is not usually recommended for use during pregnancy. \n\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are \nplanning to have a baby. Your doctor will weigh up the benefit to you against the risk to your \n\nbaby of taking Arzerra while you're pregnant. \n\n\uf0b7 Use a reliable method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are being treated \nwith Arzerra, and for 12 months after your last dose of Arzerra. Ask your doctor for advice if \n\nyou are planning to become pregnant after this period. \n\n\uf0b7 If you do become pregnant during treatment with Arzerra, tell your doctor. \n \n\nIt is not known whether the ingredients in Arzerra pass into human milk. Breast-feeding is not \n\nrecommended during treatment with Arzerra and for 12 months after the last dose. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nArzerra is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nArzerra contains sodium \n\nArzerra contains 34.8 mg sodium in each 300 mg dose, 116 mg sodium in each 1000 mg dose and \n\n232 mg sodium in each 2000 mg dose. You need to take this into account if you are on a controlled \n\nsodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\n3. How Arzerra is given \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions on the use of Arzerra, ask the doctor or nurse who is giving you the \n\ninfusion. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose \n\nThe usual dose of Arzerra for the first infusion is 300 mg. This dose will be increased, usually to \n\n1000 mg or 2000 mg, for the remaining infusions. \n\n \n\nHow it is given \n\nArzerra is given into a vein (intravenously) as an infusion (a drip) over several hours. \n\n \n\nIf you have not been previously treated for CLL you will have a maximum of 13 infusions. You \n\nwill be given an initial infusion followed by a second infusion 7 days later. The remaining infusions \n\nwill then be given once a month for up to 11 months. \n\n \n\nIf you have been previously treated for CLL but the disease returns you will have a maximum of \n\n7 infusions. You will be given an initial infusion followed by a second infusion 7 days later. The \n\nremaining infusions will then be given once a month for up to 6 months. \n\n \n\nIf you have been previously treated for CLL you will usually have a course of 12 infusions. You \n\nwill be given an infusion once a week for eight weeks. This is followed by a four- to five-week gap. \n\nThe remaining infusions will then be given once a month for four months. \n\n \n\nMedicines given before each infusion \n\nBefore each infusion of Arzerra, you will be given pre-medication - medicines which help to reduce \n\nany infusion reactions. These may include anti-histamines, steroids and pain relievers. You will be \n\nchecked closely and if you do have any reactions these will be treated. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \nMedicines of this type (monoclonal antibodies) can cause infusion-related reactions, which are \n\noccasionally severe, and can cause death. They are more likely during the first treatment. \n\n \n\nVery common symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n\uf0b7 feeling sick (nausea) \n\n\uf0b7 high temperature \n\n\uf0b7 skin rash \n\n\uf0b7 breathlessness, cough \n\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea \n\n\uf0b7 lack of energy \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\nCommon symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n\uf0b7 allergic reactions, sometimes severe where symptoms include raised and itchy rash (hives), \nswelling of the face or the mouth (angioedema) causing difficulty breathing and collapse \n\n\uf0b7 difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough \n\n\uf0b7 low blood pressure (can cause light-headedness when you stand up) \n\n\uf0b7 flushing \n\n\uf0b7 excessive sweating \n\n\uf0b7 shaking or shivering \n\n\uf0b7 rapid heart beat \n\n\uf0b7 headache \n\n\uf0b7 back pain \n\n\uf0b7 high blood pressure \n\n\uf0b7 throat pain or irritation \n\n\uf0b7 blocked nose. \n \n\nUncommon symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n\uf0b7 anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic shock, where symptoms include breathlessness or \ndifficulty breathing, wheezing or coughing, light-headedness, dizziness, changes in levels of \n\nconsciousness, hypotension, with or without mild generalised itching, skin reddening, swelling \n\nof the face and/or throat, blue discolouration of the lips, tongue or skin \n\n\uf0b7 fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) causing breathlessness \n\n\uf0b7 slow heart beat \n\n\uf0b7 blue discolouration of the lips and extremities (possible symptoms of hypoxia) \n \n\nTell your doctor or a nurse immediately if you get any of these symptoms. \n\n \n\nOther possible side effects \n\n \n\nVery common side effects \n\nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n\n\uf0b7 frequent infections, fever, chills, sore throat or mouth ulcers due to infections \n\n\uf0b7 fever, coughing, difficulty breathing, wheezing, possible symptoms of infections of the lungs or \nairways (respiratory tract) including pneumonia \n\n\uf0b7 sore throat, feeling of pressure or pain in the cheeks and forehead, infections of the ear, nose or \nthroat. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects that may show up in your blood tests: \n\n\uf0b7 low levels of white blood cells (neutropenia) \n\n\uf0b7 low levels of red blood cells (anaemia). \n \n\nCommon side effects \n\nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n\n\uf0b7 fever or, alternatively, a very low body temperature, chest pain, shortness of breath or rapid \nbreathing, shaking, chills, confusion, dizziness, decreased urination and rapid pulse, (possible \n\nsymptoms of blood infection) \n\n\uf0b7 difficulty and pain when passing urine, exaggerated sense of needing to urinate, urinary tract \ninfections \n\n\uf0b7 shingles, cold sores (possible symptoms of herpes viral infection that can potentially be severe). \n \n\nCommon side effects that may show up in your blood tests: \n\n\uf0b7 low levels of platelets in the blood (cells that help blood to clot). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42 \n\nUncommon side effects \n\nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n\n\uf0b7 blockage in the gut (intestine), which may feel like stomach pain. \n\n\uf0b7 If you have persistent stomach pain, see your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n\uf0b7 yellow skin and eyes, nausea, loss of appetite, dark urine (possible symptoms of an infection or \nreactivation of hepatitis B virus) \n\n\uf0b7 memory loss, trouble with thinking, and difficulty with walking or loss of vision (possible \nsymptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) \n\n\uf0b7 increase in potassium, phosphate and uric acid in the blood that can cause kidney problems \n(tumour lysis syndrome) \n\nThe symptoms of this condition include: \n\n\uf0b7 producing less urine than normal \n\n\uf0b7 muscle spasms. \nIf you notice these symptoms, contact your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects that may show up in your blood tests: \n\n\uf0b7 problems with blood clotting \n\n\uf0b7 the bone marrow failing to produce enough red or white blood cells \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.
