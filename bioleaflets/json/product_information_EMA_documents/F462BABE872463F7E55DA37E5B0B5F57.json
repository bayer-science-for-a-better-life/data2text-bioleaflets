NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVistide 75 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 75 mg cidofovir anhydrous.  Each vial contains 375 mg/5 ml cidofovir anhydrous as \nthe active substance. \n \nExcipients: \nEach vial contains approximately 2.5 mmol (or 57 mg) sodium per vial (5 ml) as a constituent of the \nexcipients. \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \nClear solution. \nThe formulation is adjusted to pH 7.4. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVistide is indicated for the treatment of CMV retinitis in adults with acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) and without renal dysfunction.  Vistide should be used only when other agents are \nconsidered unsuitable. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe therapy should be prescribed by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nBefore each administration of Vistide, serum creatinine and urine protein levels should be \ninvestigated.  Vistide must be administered with oral probenecid and intravenous saline as described \nbelow (see section 4.4 for appropriate recommendations, and under section 6.6 for information on \nobtaining probenecid). \n \nPosology \n \nAdults: \n \nInduction treatment.  The recommended dose of cidofovir is 5 mg/kg body weight (given as an \nintravenous infusion at a constant rate over 1 hour) administered once weekly for two consecutive \nweeks. \n \nMaintenance treatment.  Beginning two weeks after the completion of induction treatment, the \nrecommended maintenance dose of cidofovir is 5 mg/kg body weight (given as an intravenous \ninfusion at a constant rate over 1 hour) administered once every two weeks. \nSuspension of maintenance treatment with cidofovir should be considered in accordance with local \nrecommendations for the management of HIV infected patients. \n \nElderly population: \nThe safety and efficacy of Vistide have not been established for the treatment of CMV disease in \npatients over 60 years of age.  Since elderly individuals frequently have reduced glomerular function, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nparticular attention should be paid to assessing renal function before and during administration of \nVistide. \n \nRenal insufficiency: \nRenal insufficiency [creatinine clearance ≤ 55 ml/min or ≥ 2+ proteinuria (≥ 100 mg/dl)] is a \ncontraindication for the use of Vistide (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic insufficiency: \nThe safety and efficacy of Vistide have not been established in patients with hepatic disease and \ntherefore it should be used with caution in this patient population. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of Vistide in children below 18 years of age have not been established.  No \ndata are available.  Vistide is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product: \nAdequate precautions including the use of appropriate safety equipment are recommended for the \npreparation, administration and disposal of Vistide.  The preparation of Vistide reconstituted solution \nshould be done in a laminar flow biological safety cabinet.  Personnel preparing the reconstituted \nsolution should wear surgical gloves, safety glasses and a closed front surgical-type gown with knit \ncuffs.  If Vistide contacts the skin, wash membranes and flush thoroughly with water.  (See \nsection 6.6.) \n \nVistide is for intravenous infusion only.  The recommended dose, frequency, or infusion rate must not \nbe exceeded.  Vistide must be diluted in 100 millilitres 0.9% (normal) saline prior to administration.  \nThe entire volume should be infused intravenously into the patient at a constant rate over a period of \n1 hour by use of a standard infusion pump.  To minimise potential nephrotoxicity, oral probenecid and \nintravenous saline prehydration must be administered with each Vistide infusion (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nCidofovir administration is contraindicated in patients unable to receive probenecid or other sulfa-\ncontaining medication (see section 4.4 Prevention of nephrotoxicity). \n \nVistide is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency (see section 4.2). \n \nConcomitant administration of Vistide and other potentially nephrotoxic agents is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nDirect intraocular injection of Vistide is contraindicated; direct injection may be associated with \nsignificant decreases in intraocular pressure and impairment of vision. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nVistide is formulated for intravenous infusion only and must not be administered by other methods \nincluding intraocular injection or topically.  Vistide should be infused only into veins with adequate \nblood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Vistide has not been demonstrated in diseases other than CMV retinitis in \nadults with AIDS. \n \nRenal insufficiency/Haemodialysis \nTreatment with Vistide must not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 55 ml/min, or ≥ 2+ \nproteinuria (≥ 100 mg/dl), as the optimum induction and maintenance doses for patients with moderate \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nto severe renal impairment are not known.  The efficacy and safety of cidofovir in such conditions has \nnot been established. \n \nHigh flux haemodialysis has been shown to reduce the serum levels of cidofovir by approximately \n75%.  The fraction of the dose extracted during haemodialysis is 51.9 ± 11.0%. \n \nNephrotoxicity \nDose-dependent nephrotoxicity is the major dose-limiting toxicity related to administration of \ncidofovir (see section 4.8).  The safety of cidofovir has not been evaluated in patients receiving other \nknown potentially nephrotoxic agents (e.g. tenofovir, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, \nintravenous pentamidine, adefovir and vancomycin). \n \nVistide should not be administered concurrently with medicinal products containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate due to the risk of Fanconi syndrome (see section 4.5). \n \nIt is recommended to discontinue potentially nephrotoxic agents at least 7 days before starting \ncidofovir. \n \nPatients treated at 3.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg without concomitant probenecid developed \nevidence of proximal tubular cell injury, including glycosuria, and decreases in serum phosphate, uric \nacid and bicarbonate, and elevations in serum creatinine.  The signs of nephrotoxicity were partially \nreversible in some patients.  Concomitant use of probenecid is essential for reducing the pronounced \nnephrotoxicity of cidofovir to an extent that results in an acceptable benefit/risk balance of cidofovir \ntherapy. \n \nPrevention of nephrotoxicity \nTherapy must be accompanied by administration of oral probenecid and adequate intravenous saline \nprehydration (see section 6.6 for information on obtaining probenecid) with each cidofovir dose.  All \nclinical trials relevant to clinical efficacy evaluation were performed using probenecid concomitantly \nwith cidofovir.  Two grams of probenecid should be administered 3 hours prior to the cidofovir dose \nand one gram administered at 2 and again at 8 hours after completion of the 1 hour cidofovir infusion \n(for a total of 4 grams).  In order to reduce the potential for nausea and/or vomiting associated with \nadministration of probenecid, patients should be encouraged to eat food prior to each dose of \nprobenecid.  The use of an anti-emetic may be necessary. \n \nIn patients who develop allergic or hypersensitivity symptoms to probenecid (e.g., rash, fever, chills \nand anaphylaxis), prophylactic or therapeutic use of an appropriate antihistamine and/or paracetamol \nshould be considered. \n \nCidofovir administration is contraindicated in patients unable to receive probenecid because of a \nclinically significant hypersensitivity to the active substance or medicinal product or to other sulfa-\ncontaining medicines.  Use of cidofovir without concomitant probenecid has not been clinically \ninvestigated.  A probenecid desensitisation program is not recommended for use. \n \nIn addition to probenecid, patients must receive a total of one litre of 0.9% (normal) saline solution \nintravenously immediately prior to each infusion of cidofovir.  Patients who can tolerate the additional \nfluid load may receive up to a total of 2 litres of 0.9% saline intravenously with each dose of cidofovir.  \nThe first litre of saline solution should be infused over a 1 hour period immediately before the \ncidofovir infusion, and the second litre, if given, infused over a 1-3 hour period beginning \nsimultaneously with the cidofovir infusion or starting immediately after the infusion of cidofovir. \n \nCidofovir therapy should be discontinued and intravenous hydration is advised if serum creatinine \nincreases by ≥ 44 µmol/l (≥ 0.5 mg/dl), or if persistent proteinuria ≥ 2+ develops.  In patients \nexhibiting ≥ 2+ proteinuria, intravenous hydration should be performed and the test repeated.  If \nfollowing hydration, a ≥ 2+ proteinuria is still observed, cidofovir therapy should be discontinued.  \nContinued administration of cidofovir to patients with persistent ≥ 2+ proteinuria following \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nintravenous hydration may result in further evidence of proximal tubular injury, including glycosuria, \ndecreases in serum phosphate, uric acid and bicarbonate, and elevations in serum creatinine. \n \nInterruption, and possibly discontinuation, is required for changes in renal function.  For those patients \nwho fully recover from cidofovir associated renal toxicity, the benefits-risk balance of reintroducing \ncidofovir has not yet been evaluated. \n \nPatient monitoring \nProteinuria appears to be an early and sensitive indicator of cidofovir-induced nephrotoxicity.  Patients \nreceiving cidofovir must have their serum creatinine and urine protein levels determined on specimens \nobtained within 24 hours prior to the administration of each dose of cidofovir.  Differential white \nblood cell counts should also be performed prior to each dose of cidofovir (see section 4.8). \n \nOcular events \nPatients receiving cidofovir should be advised to have regular follow-up ophthalmologic examinations \nfor possible occurrence of uveitis/iritis and ocular hypotony.  In case of uveitis/iritis cidofovir should \nbe discontinued if there is no response to treatment with a topical corticosteroid or the condition \nworsens, or if iritis/uveitis reoccurs after successful treatment. \n \nOther \nCidofovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans (see section 5.3). \n \nCaution should be applied when considering cidofovir treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus due \nto the potential increased risk of developing ocular hypotony. \n \nMale patients should be advised that cidofovir caused reduced testes weight and hypospermia in \nanimals.  Although not observed in clinical studies of cidofovir, such changes may occur in humans \nand cause infertility.  Men should be advised to practice barrier contraceptive methods during and for \n3 months after treatment with cidofovir (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n \nAppropriate precautions should continue to be employed to prevent transmission of HIV. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains approximately 2.5 mmol (or 57 mg) sodium per vial which should be \ntaken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere is a risk that concomitant treatment of Vistide with products containing tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate may give rise to a pharmacodynamic interaction and increase the risk of Fanconi syndrome \n(see section 4.4). \n \nProbenecid increases the AUC of zidovudine.  Patients receiving both drugs should be closely \nmonitored for zidovudine induced haematological toxicity. \n \nFor other NRTI drugs administered concomitantly with probenecid, reference should be made to their \nrespective prescribing information for any appropriate recommendations. \n \nInteractions of cidofovir/probenecid and anti-HIV drugs or drugs used to treat common chronic viral \ninfections in this population, such as HCV- and HBV-related hepatitis, have not been investigated in \nclinical trials. \n \nProbenecid is known to increase the exposure of many substances (e.g., paracetamol, acyclovir, \nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aminosalicyclic acid, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, \nbumetanide, clofibrate, methotrexate, famotidine, furosemide, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, \ntheophylline, and zidovudine). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nTherefore, when co-prescribing cidofovir/probenecid with other agents, it is important for prescribers \nto consult the current probenecid SmPC (or an appropriate drug reference source) and the respective \nprescribing information of the other co-administered products for full information regarding drug \ninteractions and other features of that product. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females: \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and after treatment with \ncidofovir.  Men should be advised to practice barrier contraceptive methods during and for 3 months \nafter treatment with cidofovir (see section 4.4). \n \nPregnancy: \nThere are no data from the use of cidofovir in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nVistide is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding: \nIt is unknown whether cidofovir/metabolites are excreted in human milk.  A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded.  Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \ncidofovir. \n \nFertility: \nThere are no studies of cidofovir on the fertility of men or women.  Male patients should be advised \nthat cidofovir caused reduced testes weight and hypospermia in animals. Although not observed in \nclinical studies of cidofovir, such changes may occur in humans and cause infertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCidofovir has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Adverse reactions such as \nasthenia may occur during cidofovir therapy.  The physician is advised to discuss this issue with the \npatient, and based upon the condition of the disease and the tolerance of medication, give his \nrecommendation in the individual case. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe table below lists the adverse reactions identified through clinical trials or post-marketing \nsurveillance by system organ class (SOC) and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as: very common \n(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).  Adverse reactions identified from post-marketing experience are \nincluded in italics. \n \nAdverse reactions possibly or probably related to cidofovir based on clinical trial experience and \npost-marketing surveillance \n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common Neutropenia \nNervous system disorders \nVery common Headache \nEye disorders \nCommon Iritis, uveitis, hypotony of the eye  \n\n(see section 4.4) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \nNot known Hearing impaired \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon Dyspnea \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common \nCommon \nNot known \n\nNausea, vomiting \nDiarrhoea \nPancreatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common Alopecia, rash \nRenal and urinary disorders \nVery common \n \nCommon \nUncommon \n\nProteinuria, blood creatinine increased \n(see section 4.4) \nRenal failure \nFanconi syndrome acquired \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common \nCommon \n\nAsthenia, fever \nChills \n\n \nReports of renal failure (plus events possibly caused by renal failure, e.g. blood creatinine increased, \nproteinuria, glycosuria) received during post-marketing surveillance include some which were fatal.  \nCases of acute renal failure have been reported after only one or two doses of cidofovir. \n \nThe finding of any glycosuria, proteinuria/aminoaciduria, hypouricemia, hypophosphatemia and/or \nhypokalemia, should prompt for the consideration of cidofovir-related Fanconi syndrome. \n \nThe following table lists adverse reactions possibly or probably related to probenecid based on clinical \ntrial experience: \n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions \nNervous system disorders \nCommon Headache \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common Nausea, vomiting \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common Rash \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common \nCommon \n\nFever \nAsthenia, chills \n\n \nIn addition probenecid may also cause other adverse reactions including anorexia, gingival pain, \nflushing, alopecia, dizziness, anaemia, and pollakiuria.  Hypersensitivity reactions, with dermatitis, \npruritus, urticaria and, rarely, anaphylaxis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have occurred.  There have \nbeen reports of leukopenia, hepatic necrosis, nephrotic syndrome, and aplastic anaemia.  Haemolytic \nanaemia has also occurred, and may be associated with G6DP deficiency.  Therefore, when co-\nprescribing probenecid with cidofovir, it is important for prescribers to consult the current probenecid \nSmPC (or an appropriate drug reference source) for full information on the safety profile and other \nfeatures of that product. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nTwo cases of cidofovir overdose have been reported.  In both cases, the overdose occurred during the \nfirst induction dose and no additional cidofovir therapy was administered.  One patient received a \nsingle dose of 16.4 mg/kg and the other patient received a single dose of 17.3 mg/kg.  Both patients \nwere hospitalised and received prophylactic oral probenecid and vigorous hydration for 3 to 7 days.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nOne of these patients experienced a minor transient change in renal function, while the other patient \nhad no change in renal function (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, nucleosides and nucleotides excluding \nreverse transcriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AB12 \n \nGeneral \nCidofovir is a cytidine analogue with in vitro and in vivo activity against human cytomegalovirus \n(HCMV).  HCMV strains resistant to ganciclovir may still be susceptible to cidofovir. \n \nMechanism of action \nCidofovir suppresses HCMV replication by selective inhibition of viral DNA synthesis.  Biochemical \ndata support selective inhibition of HSV-1, HSV-2 and HCMV DNA polymerases by cidofovir \ndiphosphate, the active intracellular metabolite of cidofovir. \n \nCidofovir diphosphate inhibits these viral polymerases at concentrations that are 8- to 600-fold lower \nthan those needed to inhibit human cellular DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma.  Incorporation \nof cidofovir into viral DNA results in reductions in the rate of viral DNA synthesis. \n \nCidofovir enters cells by fluid-phase endocytosis and is phosphorylated to cidofovir monophosphate \nand subsequently to cidofovir diphosphate.  Prolonged antiviral effects of cidofovir are related to the \nhalf-lives of its metabolites; cidofovir diphosphate persists inside cells with a half-life of 17-65 hours \nand a cidofovir phosphate-choline adduct has a half-life of 87 hours. \n \nAntiviral activity \nCidofovir is active in vitro against HCMV, a member of the herpesviridae family.  Antiviral activity is \nseen at concentrations significantly below those which cause cell death. \n \nThe in vitro sensitivity to cidofovir is shown in the following table: \n \n\nCidofovir inhibition of virus  \nmultiplication in cell culture \nVirus  IC50 (µM) \nwild-type CMV isolates \nganciclovir-resistant CMV isolates \nfoscarnet-resistant CMV isolates \n\n 0.7 (± 0.6) \n7.5 (± 4.3) \n0.59 (± 0.07) \n\n \nIn vivo activity against HCMV was confirmed with controlled clinical studies of cidofovir for the \ntreatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, which demonstrated statistically significant delays \nin time to CMV retinitis progression for patients on cidofovir when compared to control patients.  The \nmedian times to retinitis progression in the two efficacy studies (GS-93-106 and GS-93-105), were \n120 days and not reached for the treatment arms vs. 22 days and 21 days for the untreated (deferred \ntreatment) arms, respectively. \n \nIn study GS-93-107 conducted in patients who had relapsed after treatment with other agents, the \nmedian time to retinitis progression was 115 days. \n \nViral resistance \nFollowing in vitro selection of ganciclovir-resistant HCMV isolates, cross-resistance between \nganciclovir and cidofovir was seen with ganciclovir-selected mutations in the HCMV DNA \npolymerase gene but not with mutations in the UL97 gene.  No cross-resistance between foscarnet and \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n \n\ncidofovir was seen with foscarnet-selected mutants.  Cidofovir-selected mutants had a mutation in the \nDNA polymerase gene and were cross-resistant to ganciclovir, but susceptible to foscarnet. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe major route of elimination of cidofovir was by renal excretion of unchanged drug by a \ncombination of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.  In patients with normal renal function, 80 \nto 100% of the intravenous dose was recovered in the urine over 24 hours as unchanged cidofovir.  No \nmetabolites of cidofovir have been detected in serum or urine of patients. \n \nAt the end of a one-hour infusion of cidofovir 5 mg/kg administered with concomitant oral \nprobenecid, the mean (± SD) serum concentration of cidofovir was 19.6 (± 7.18) µg/ml.  The mean \nvalues of total serum clearance, volume of distribution at steady-state and terminal elimination half-\nlife were 138 (± 36) ml/h/kg, 388 (± 125) ml/kg and 2.2 (± 0.5) h, respectively.  Dose-independent \nkinetics were demonstrated with single doses of cidofovir given over the dose range 3 to 7.5 mg/kg. \n \nIn vitro protein binding \nIn vitro protein binding of cidofovir to plasma or serum protein was 10% or less over the cidofovir \nconcentration range 0.25 to 25 µg/ml. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical animal studies demonstrated that nephrotoxicity was the major dose-limiting toxicity of \ncidofovir.  Evidence for a nephroprotective effect for probenecid was shown in a 52-week study \nconducted in cynomolgus monkeys administered cidofovir 2.5 mg/kg once weekly intravenously with \n1 g of probenecid given orally. \n \nCarcinogenesis \nIn a 26-week intravenous toxicity study, a significant increase in incidence of mammary \nadenocarcinomas was seen in female rats and of Zymbal’s gland carcinomas in male and female rats at \nsubtherapeutic plasma levels of cidofovir.  In a separate study, once weekly subcutaneous injections of \ncidofovir for 19 consecutive weeks resulted in mammary adenocarcinomas in female rats at doses as \nlow as 0.6 mg/kg/week.  In both studies, tumours were observed within 3 months of dosing.  No \ntumours were observed in cynomolgus monkeys administered cidofovir intravenously once weekly for \n52 weeks at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/week. \n \nMutagenicity and reproductive toxicology \nStudies have shown that cidofovir is clastogenic in vitro at 100 µg/ml and is embryotoxic in rats and \nrabbits. \n \nNo mutagenic response was elicited by cidofovir at dose levels up to 5 mg/plate, in the presence and \nabsence of metabolic activation by rat liver S-9 fraction, in microbial assays involving Salmonella \ntyphimurium for base pair substitutions or frameshift mutations (Ames) and Escherichia coli for \nreverse mutations. \n \nAn increase in formation of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in vivo in mice \nreceiving a high, toxic intraperitoneal dose of cidofovir (≥ 2,000 mg/kg). \n \nCidofovir induced chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro without \nmetabolic activation (S-9 fraction).  At the 4 cidofovir levels (12.5 to 100 µg/ml) tested, the \npercentage of damaged metaphases and number of aberrations per cell increased in a concentration-\ndependent manner. \n \nMale patients should be advised that cidofovir caused reduced testes weight and hypospermia in \nanimals.  No adverse effects on fertility or general reproduction were seen following once weekly \nintravenous injections of cidofovir in male rats for 13 consecutive weeks at doses up to \n15 mg/kg/week.  Female rats dosed intravenously once weekly at 1.2 mg/kg/week or higher for up to \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n6 weeks prior to mating and for 2 weeks post mating had decreased litter sizes and live births per litter \nand increased early resorptions per litter.  Peri- and post-natal development studies in which female \nrats received subcutaneous injections of cidofovir once daily at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day from day 7 \nof gestation through day 21 postpartum (approximately 5 weeks) resulted in no adverse effects on \nviability, growth, behaviour, sexual maturation or reproductive capacity in the offspring.  Daily \nintravenous administration of cidofovir during the period of organogenesis led to reduced fetal body \nweights when administered to pregnant rats at 1.5 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at 1.0 mg/kg/day.  \nA significantly increased foetal incidence of external, soft tissue and skeletal anomalies occurred in \nrabbits at 1.0 mg/kg/day, which was also maternally toxic.  The no-observable-effect doses for \nembryotoxicity were 0.5 mg/kg/day in rats and 0.25 mg/kg/day in rabbits. \n \n \n6.

What Vistide is and what it is used for \n \nVistide is used to treat an eye infection called CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS (Acquired \nImmunodeficiency Syndrome).  Vistide will not cure CMV retinitis but may improve your condition \nby delaying progression of the disease. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Vistide has not been demonstrated in diseases other than CMV retinitis in \npatients with AIDS. \n \nVistide must be administered by a healthcare professional (doctor or nurse) in a hospital setting. \n \nWhat is CMV retinitis? \n \nCMV retinitis is an eye infection caused by a virus named cytomegalovirus (CMV).  CMV attacks the \nretina of the eye and may cause loss of vision, and eventually lead to blindness.  Patients with AIDS \nare at high risk of developing CMV retinitis or other forms of CMV disease such as colitis (an \ninflammatory bowel disease).  Treatment for CMV retinitis is necessary to reduce the potential for \nblindness. \n \nVistide is an antiviral medicine which blocks the replication of CMV by interfering with viral DNA \nproduction. \n \n \n2. Before you use Vistide \n \nDo not use Vistide \n \n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cidofovir or any of the other ingredients of Vistide. \n• If you have ever had kidney disease. \n• If you cannot take the medicine probenecid because of a serious allergy to probenecid or \n\nother sulfa-containing medicines (e.g. sulfamethoxazole). \n \nIf any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor.  You are not to be given Vistide. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nTake special care with Vistide \n \n• Kidney damage is the major side effect of Vistide treatment.  To reduce the risk of kidney \n\ndamage, you will receive intravenous fluids (normal saline) before each dose of Vistide and \nprobenecid tablets before and after each dose of Vistide (see section 3 below for more \ninformation).  Your doctor may also instruct you to drink plenty of fluids.  Your doctor will \nmonitor your kidney function before each dose of Vistide.  Your treatment with Vistide may be \nstopped by your doctor if changes in kidney function occur. \n\n \n• Tell your doctor if you have diabetes mellitus.  Vistide should be used with caution in \n\ndiabetic patients due to the potential increased risk of developing low pressure in the eye \n(ocular hypotony). \n\n \n• During treatment with Vistide you should receive regular follow-up eye examinations for \n\npossible eye irritation, inflammation or swelling.  If you get pain, redness or itching of the eye \nor changes in your vision, tell your doctor promptly. \n\n \n• Vistide caused reduced testes weight and low sperm count (hypospermia) in animals.  Although \n\nnot observed in human studies of Vistide, such changes may occur in humans and cause \ninfertility.  Men should practice barrier birth control methods during and for 3 months \nafter treatment with Vistide. \n\n \n• Vistide is not used for the treatment of HIV infection.  Vistide will not stop you passing HIV \n\ninfection onto other people so you should continue to take precautions to avoid infecting \nothers. \n\n \nUse in children \n \nVistide has not been studied in children.  Therefore, this medicine should not be used in children. \n \nUsing other medicines \n \n• Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, as these may interact with \nVistide or probenecid. \n\n \nIt is very important to tell your doctor if you are receiving other medicines that may damage \nyour kidneys. \n \nThese include: \n• tenofovir containing medicines, used to treat HIV-1 infection and/or chronic hepatitis B \n\ninfection \n• aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infections) \n• amphotericin B (for fungal infection) \n• foscarnet (for viral infection) \n• adefovir (for HBV infection) \n \nThese medicines must be stopped at least 7 days before taking Vistide. \n \n• Probenecid may interact with other medicines commonly used in the treatment of AIDS and \n\nAIDS-related illnesses, such as zidovudine (AZT).  If you are taking zidovudine, you should \ndiscuss with your doctor whether to temporarily stop taking zidovudine or decrease the dose of \nzidovudine by 50% on days when Vistide and probenecid are given. \n\n \n• The potential for interactions between Vistide and anti-HIV protease inhibitors has not been \n\nstudied. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \nUsing Vistide with food and drink \n \nFood should be taken before you are given Vistide.  Your doctor may instruct you to drink plenty of \nfluids before receiving Vistide. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n• You should not be given Vistide if you are pregnant.  If you become pregnant while \n\nreceiving this medication, you must inform your doctor immediately.  Vistide has been shown \nto cause damage in unborn animals and should not be used during pregnancy unless the \npotential benefits justify the risks to the foetus.  If you could get pregnant, you must use an \neffective method of contraception to stop you getting pregnant during treatment with Vistide \nand for 1 month afterwards. \n\n \n• You should not be given Vistide if you are breast-feeding.  It is not known whether Vistide is \n\npassed on to the baby in human milk.  Because many medicines are passed through to human \nmilk, nursing mothers should stop Vistide or stop breast-feeding if they continue to receive \nVistide. \n\n \n• In general, women with HIV should not breast-feed in order to avoid passing HIV to their \n\ninfant through the milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nVistide may cause short-term side effects such as fatigue or weakness.

How to use Vistide \n \nVistide is given by intravenous infusion (a drip into a vein).  It must not be administered by other \nmethods including intraocular injection (direct injection into the eye) or topically (on the skin).  \nVistide must be given by a doctor or nurse with appropriate experience in treating people with AIDS. \n \nThe doctor or nurse will transfer the appropriate dose of Vistide from the vial to an infusion bag \ncontaining 100 ml 0.9% (normal) saline solution.  The entire volume of the bag will be infused into \nyour vein at a constant rate over a period of 1 hour using a standard infusion pump.  The \nrecommended dose, frequency of use, or rate of infusion must not be exceeded.  At the end of this \nleaflet, there is further information for healthcare professionals on how to administer Vistide. \n \nTo lower the risk of kidney damage, probenecid tablets and intravenous fluids (saline solution) \nmust be given on the day of each Vistide infusion.  (See sub-sections “How to take probenecid with \nVistide” and “How IV fluids are given before Vistide” below.) \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nDose in adults \n \nThe dose you will need is calculated based on your body weight. \n \nStarting (induction) treatment \nThe recommended dose of Vistide in patients with normal kidney function is 5 mg per kg of body \nweight given once weekly for two consecutive weeks. \n \nMaintenance treatment \nBeginning two weeks after completion of induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dose of \nVistide in patients with normal kidney function is 5 mg per kg of body weight given once every two \nweeks. \n \nDose adjustment \nIf you have kidney problems, Vistide may not be appropriate treatment for you.  Samples of your \nurine and/or blood will be taken before each infusion of Vistide and used for testing kidney function.  \nFor patients with evidence of decreased kidney function, your Vistide dose may be interrupted or \nstopped depending on your individual case. \n \nIf you have accidentally been given more Vistide than prescribed for you, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nHow to take probenecid with Vistide \n \nProbenecid tablets are given to lower the risk of kidney damage.  You must take 3 doses of \nprobenecid tablets orally on the same day as Vistide as shown in the following table: \n \n\nTime Dose \n3 hours before start of Vistide infusion 2 g probenecid \n2 hours after end of Vistide infusion 1 g probenecid \n8 hours after end of Vistide infusion 1 g probenecid \nTotal 4 g probenecid \n \nProbenecid is only taken on the same day that Vistide is given. \n \nHow IV fluids are given before Vistide \n \nNormal saline is given to lower the risk of kidney damage.  You should receive a total of one litre \nof 0.9% (normal) saline solution intravenously (as a drip into a vein) before each Vistide dose.  The \nsaline solution should be infused over a 1 hour period immediately before the Vistide infusion.  If you \ncan tolerate the additional fluid load, your doctor may administer a second litre of fluid.  If \nadministered, the second litre of saline should be given either at the start of the Vistide infusion or \nimmediately afterwards, and infused over a 1 to 3 hour period.  Your doctor may also tell you to drink \nplenty of fluids. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
