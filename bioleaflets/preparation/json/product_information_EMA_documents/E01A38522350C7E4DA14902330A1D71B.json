NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFirazyr 30 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach pre-filled syringe of 3 ml contains icatibant acetate equivalent to 30 mg icatibant.  \nEach ml of the solution contains 10 mg of icatibant. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \nThe solution is a clear and colourless liquid.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFirazyr is indicated for symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in \nadults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older, with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFirazyr is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose for adults is a single subcutaneous injection of Firazyr 30 mg.  \n \nIn the majority of cases a single injection of Firazyr is sufficient to treat an attack. In case of \ninsufficient relief or recurrence of symptoms, a second injection of Firazyr can be administered after \n6 hours. If the second injection produces insufficient relief or a recurrence of symptoms is observed, a \nthird injection of Firazyr can be administered after a further 6 hours. No more than 3 injections of \nFirazyr should be administered in a 24 hour period.  \n \nIn the clinical trials, not more than 8 injections of Firazyr per month have been administered.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe recommended dose of Firazyr based on body weight in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 17 \nyears) is provided in table 1 below.   \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1: Dosage regimen for paediatric patients \n \n\nBody Weight Dose (Injection Volume) \n\n12 kg to 25 kg 10 mg (1.0 ml) \n\n26 kg to 40 kg 15 mg (1.5 ml) \n\n41 kg to 50 kg 20 mg (2.0 ml) \n\n51 kg to 65 kg 25 mg (2.5 ml) \n\n>65 kg 30 mg (3.0 ml) \n\n \nIn the clinical trial, not more than 1 injection of Firazyr per HAE attack has been administered. \n \nNo dosage regimen for children aged less than 2 years or weighing less than 12 kg can be \nrecommended as the safety and efficacy in this paediatric group has not been established. \n \nElderly \nLimited information is available on patients older than 65 years of age.  \n \nElderly people have been shown to have increased systemic exposure to icatibant. The relevance of \nthis to the safety of Firazyr is unknown (see section 5.2).   \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFirazyr is intended for subcutaneous administration preferably in the abdominal area.   \n \nFirazyr solution for injection should be injected slowly due to the volume to be administered. \n \nEach Firazyr syringe is intended for single use only. \n \nRefer to the patient information leaflet for instructions for use. \n \nCaregiver/self-administration \nThe decision on initiating caregiver or self-administration of Firazyr should only be taken by a \nphysician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema (see section 4.4).  \n \nAdults \nFirazyr may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training in subcutaneous \ninjection technique by a healthcare professional. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 2-17 years \nFirazyr may be administered by a caregiver only after training in subcutaneous injection technique by \na healthcare professional. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLaryngeal attacks \n \nPatients with laryngeal attacks should be managed in an appropriate medical institution after injection \nuntil the physician considers discharge to be safe. \n \nIschemic heart disease \n \nUnder ischemic conditions, a deterioration of cardiac function and a decrease in coronary blood flow \ncould theoretically arise from antagonism of bradykinin receptor type 2. Caution should therefore be \nobserved in the administration of Firazyr to patients with acute ischemic heart disease or unstable \nangina pectoris (see section 5.3). \n \nStroke \n \nAlthough there is evidence to support a beneficial effect of B2 receptor blockade immediately \nfollowing a stroke, there is a theoretical possibility that icatibant may attenuate the positive late phase \nneuroprotective effects of bradykinin. Accordingly, caution should be observed in the administration \nof icatibant to patients in the weeks following a stroke. \n \nCaregiver/self-administration  \n \nFor patients who have never received Firazyr previously, the first treatment should be given in a \nmedical institution or under the guidance of a physician. \n \nIn case of insufficient relief or recurrence of symptoms after self-treatment or administration by a \ncaregiver, it is recommended that the patient or caregiver should seek medical advice. For adults, \nsubsequent doses that may be required for the same attack should be administered within a medical \ninstitution (see section 4.2). There are no data on administering subsequent doses for the same attack \nin adolescents or children.   \n \nPatients experiencing a laryngeal attack should always seek medical advice and be observed in a \nmedical institution also after having taken the injection at home. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is limited experience with treatment of more than one HAE attack with Firazyr in the paediatric \npopulation. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacokinetic drug interactions involving CYP450 are not expected (see section 5.2). \n \nCo-administration of Firazyr with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has not been \nstudied. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in HAE patients due to possible enhancement of \nbradykinin levels. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nFor icatibant, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies showed effects on \nuterine implantation and parturition (see section 5.3), but the potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n \nFirazyr should be used during pregnancy only, if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the \nfoetus, (e.g for treatment of potentially life threatening laryngeal attacks). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIcatibant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in maternal blood. \nNo effects were detected in the post-natal development of rat pups.  \n \nIt is unknown whether icatibant is excreted in human breast milk but it is recommended that \nbreastfeeding women, who wish to take Firazyr, should not breastfeed for 12 hours after treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nIn both rats and dogs, repeated use of icatibant resulted in effects on reproductive organs. Icatibant had \nno effect on the fertility of male mice and rats (see section 5.3). In a study of 39 healthy adult men and \nwomen treated with 30 mg every 6 hours for 3 doses every 3 days for a total of 9 doses, there were no \nclinically significant changes from baseline in basal and GnRH-stimulated concentration of \nreproductive hormones in either females or males. There were no significant effects of icatibant on the \nconcentration of luteal phase progesterone and luteal function, or on menstrual cycle length in females \nand there were no significant effects of icatibant on sperm count, motility and morphology in males. \nThe dosing regimen used for this study is unlikely to be sustained in the clinical setting. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFirazyr has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, lethargy, tiredness, \nsomnolence, and dizziness have been reported following the use of Firazyr. These symptoms may \noccur as a result of an attack of HAE. Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they \nfeel tired or dizzy. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical studies used for registration, a total of 999 HAE attacks have been treated with 30 mg \nFirazyr administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional. Firazyr 30 mg SC has been \nadministered by a healthcare professional to 129 healthy subjects and 236 patients with HAE. \n \nAlmost all subjects who were treated with subcutaneous icatibant in clinical trials developed reactions \nat the site of injection (characterised by skin irritation, swelling, pain, itchiness, erythema, burning \nsensation). These reactions were generally mild to moderate in severity, transient, and resolved \nwithout further intervention.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed in Table 1 is defined using the following convention: \nVery common (â‰¥1/10); common (â‰¥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (â‰¥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (â‰¥1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \nAll adverse reactions from post-marketing experience are italicised. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with icatibant  \n \n\nSystem Organ Class \n(incidence category) \n\nPreferred Term \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\n(Common, â‰¥1/100 to <1/10) Dizziness \nHeadache \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\n(Common, â‰¥1/100 to <1/10) Nausea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n\n(Common, â‰¥1/100 to <1/10) Rash  \nErythema \nPruritus \n\n(Unknown) Urticaria \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n \n\n(Very Common, â‰¥1/10) Injection site reactions* \n\n(Common, â‰¥1/100 to <1/10) Pyrexia \n\nInvestigations  \n\n(Common, â‰¥1/100 to <1/10) Transaminases increased \n* Injection site bruising, Injection site hematoma, Injection site burning, Injection site erythema, Injection site \nhypoesthesia, Injection site irritation, Injection site numbness, Injection site edema, Injection site pain, \nInjection site pressure sensation, Injection site pruritus, Injection site swelling, Injection site urticaria, and \nInjection site warmth. \n\n \nPaediatric Population \n \nA total of 32 paediatric patients (8 children aged 2 to 11 years and 24 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years) \nwith HAE were exposed to treatment with icatibant during clinical studies. Thirty-one patients \nreceived a single dose of icatibant and 1 patient (an adolescent) received icatibant for two HAE attacks \n(in total, two doses). Firazyr was administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg based \non body weight to a maximum dose of 30 mg.   \n \nThe majority of paediatric patients who were treated with subcutaneous icatibant experienced injection \nsite reactions such as erythema, swelling, burning sensation, skin pain and itching/pruritus; these were \nfound to be mild to moderate in severity and consistent with reactions that have been reported in \nadults. Two paediatric patients experienced injection site reactions which were assessed as severe and \nwhich were completely resolved within 6 hours. These reactions were erythema, swelling, burning and \nwarm sensation.  \n \nNo clinically significant changes in reproductive hormones were observed during clinical studies. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nImmunogenicity \nAcross repeated treatment in adults in the controlled phase III trials, transient positivity to anti-\nicatibant antibodies was observed in rare cases. All patients maintained efficacy. One Firazyr-treated \npatient tested positive for anti-icatibant antibodies before and after treatment with Firazyr. This patient \nwas followed for 5 months and further samples were negative for anti-icatibant antibodies. No \nhypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions were reported with Firazyr.   \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo clinical information on overdose is available. \n \nA dose of 3.2 mg/kg intravenously (approximately 8 times the therapeutic dose) caused transient \nerythema, itching, flushing or hypotension in healthy subjects. No therapeutic intervention was \nnecessary.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, drugs used to treat hereditary angioedema; \nATC code: B06AC02. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nHAE (an autosomal dominant disease) is caused by an absence or dysfunction of C1-esterase-\ninhibitor. HAE attacks are accompanied by an increased release of bradykinin, which is the key \nmediator in the development of the clinical symptoms.  \n \nHAE manifests as intermittent attacks of subcutaneous and/or sub mucosal oedema involving the \nupper respiratory tract, the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. An attack usually lasts between 2 to 5 \ndays. \n \nIcatibant is a selective competitive antagonist at the bradykinin type 2 (B2) receptor. It is a synthetic \ndecapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin, but with 5 non-proteinogenic amino acids. In HAE \nincreased bradykinin concentrations are the key mediator in the development of the clinical symptoms.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn healthy young subjects, icatibant administered in doses of 0.8 mg/kg over 4 hours; 1.5 mg/kg/day or \n0.15 mg/kg/day for 3 days, development of bradykinin-induced hypotension, vasodilatation and reflex \ntachycardia was prevented. Icatibant was shown to be a competitive antagonist when the bradykinin \nchallenge dose was increased 4-fold.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy data were obtained from an initial open-label Phase II study and from three controlled Phase \nIII studies.  \n \nPhase III clinical studies (FAST-1 and FAST-2) were randomized, double-blind, controlled trials and \nhad identical designs except for the comparator (one with oral tranexamic acid as the comparator and \none placebo controlled). A total of 130 patients were randomized to receive either a 30 mg dose of \nicatibant (63 patients) or comparator (either tranexamic acid, - 38 or placebo - 29 patients). \nSubsequent episodes of HAE were treated in an open label extension. Patients with symptoms of \nlaryngeal angioedema received open label treatment with icatibant. The primary efficacy endpoint was \nthe time to onset of symptom relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Table 3 shows the efficacy \nresults for these studies. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n \nFAST-3 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 98 adult patients with a median \nage of 36 years. Patients were randomized to receive either icatibant 30 mg or placebo by \nsubcutaneous injection. A subset of patients in this study experienced acute HAE attacks while \nreceiving androgens, antifibrinolytic agents or Cl inhibitors. The primary endpoint was time to onset \nof symptom relief assessed using a 3-item composite visual analog score (VAS-3) consisting of \nassessments of skin swelling, skin pain, and abdominal pain. Table 4 shows the efficacy results for \nFAST-3.  \n \nIn these studies, patients on icatibant had a faster median time to onset of symptom relief (2.0, 2.5 and \n2.0 hours, respectively) compared to tranexamic acid (12.0 hours) and placebo (4.6 and 19.8 hours). \nThe treatment effect of icatibant was confirmed by secondary efficacy endpoints.  \n \nIn an integrated analysis of these controlled Phase III studies, the time to onset of symptom relief and \ntime to onset of primary symptom relief were similar regardless of age group, sex, race, weight or \nwhether or not the patient used androgens or antifibrinolytic agents. \n \nResponse was also consistent across repeated attacks in the controlled Phase III trials. A total of 237 \npatients were treated with 1,386 doses of 30 mg icatibant for 1,278 attacks of acute HAE. In the first \n15 Firazyr treated attacks (1,114 doses for 1,030 attacks), the median times to onset of symptom relief \nwere similar across attacks (2.0 to 2.5 hours). 92.4% of these attacks of HAE were treated with a \nsingle dose of Firazyr. \n \nTable 3.

The results were similar to patients with non-laryngeal attacks of HAE with respect \nto time to onset of symptom relief. \n \nPaediatric population \nAn open label, non-randomised single-arm study (HGT-FIR-086) was performed with a total of 32 \npatients. All patients received at least one dose of icatibant (0.4mg/kg body weight up to a maximum \ndose of 30 mg) and the majority of patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Eleven \npatients were of prepubertal status and 21 patients were either pubertal or postpubertal. \n \nThe efficacy population consisted of 22 patients who had been treated with icatibant (11 prepubertal \nand 11 pubertal/postpubertal) for HAE attack. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the time to onset of symptom relief (TOSR) measured using a \ncomposite investigator-reported symptom score. Time to symptom relief was defined as the duration \nof time (in hours) taken for improvement of symptoms to occur by a magnitude of 20%.  \n \nOverall the median time to onset of symptom relief was 1.0 hour (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.1 \nhours). At 1 and 2 hours post treatment, approximately 50% and 90% of patients experienced onset of \nsymptom relief, respectively.   \nOverall, the median time to minimal symptoms (earliest time post treatment when all symptoms were \neither mild or absent) was 1.1 hours (95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.0 hours). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of icatibant has been characterized by studies using both intravenous and \nsubcutaneous administration to healthy volunteers and patients. The pharmacokinetic profile of \nicatibant in patients with HAE is similar to that in healthy volunteers. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability of icatibant is 97%. The time to \nmaximum concentration is approximately 30 minutes.  \n \nDistribution  \n \nIcatibant volume of distribution (Vss) is about 20-25 L. Plasma protein binding is 44%.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nElimination \n \nIcatibant is mainly eliminated by metabolism with less than 10% of the dose eliminated in the urine as \nunchanged drug. Clearance is about 15-20 l/h and independent of dose. The terminal plasma half-life \nis about 1-2 hours.  \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nIcatibant is extensively metabolized by proteolytic enzymes to inactive metabolites that are primarily \nexcreted in the urine. \n \nIn vitro studies have confirmed that icatibant is not degraded by oxidative metabolic pathways and is \nnot an inhibitor of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, \n2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and is not an inducer of CYP 1A2 and 3A4.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nData suggest an age-related decline in clearance resulting in about 50-60% higher exposure in older \npeople (75-80 years) compared to patients aged 40 years.  \n \nGender \nData suggest that there is no difference in the clearance between females and males after correcting for \nbody weight.  \n \nHepatic and Renal Impairment \nLimited data suggest that icatibant exposure is not influenced by hepatic or renal impairment.  \n \nRace \nInformation on individual race effect is limited. Available exposure data suggest no difference in the \nclearance between non-White (n=40) and White (n=132) subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of icatibant were characterized in paediatric HAE patients in study HGT-FIR-\n086 (see section 5.1). Following a single subcutaneous administration (0.4 mg/kg up to a maximum of \n30 mg), the time to maximum concentration is approximately 30 minutes and the terminal half-life is \nabout 2 hours. There are no observed differences in the exposure to icatibant between HAE patients \nwith and without an attack. Population pharmacokinetic modelling using both adult and paediatric data \nshowed that clearance of icatibant is related to body weight with lower clearance values noted for \nlower body weights in the paediatric HAE population. Based on modelling for weight banded dosing, \nthe predicted exposure to icatibant in the paediatric HAE population (see section 4.2) is lower than the \nobserved exposure in studies conducted with adult HAE patients. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nRepeated-dose studies of up to 6-months duration in rats and 9-months duration in dogs have been \nconducted. In both rats and dogs, there was a dose-related reduction in circulating sex hormone levels \nand the repeated use of icatibant reversibly delayed sexual maturation. \n \nMaximum daily exposures defined by area under the curve (AUC) at the No Observed Adverse Effect \nLevels (NOAEL) in the 9-month study in dog were 2.3 times the AUC in adult humans after a \nsubcutaneous dose of 30 mg. A NOAEL was not measurable in the rat study, however, all of the \nfindings from that study showed either completely or partially reversible effects in treated rats. \nAdrenal gland hypertrophy was observed at all doses tested in rats.  Adrenal gland hypertrophy was \n\n\n\n12 \n\nseen to reverse after cessation of icatibant treatment. The clinical relevance of the adrenal gland \nfindings is unknown. \n \nIcatibant had no effect on the fertility of male mice (top dose 80.8 mg/kg/day) and rats (top dose \n10 mg/kg/day). \n \nIn a 2 year study to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of icatibant in rats, daily doses giving exposure \nlevels up to approximately 2-fold that achieved after a therapeutic dose in humans had no effect on the \nincidence or morphology of tumours. Results do not indicate a carcinogenic potential for icatibant. \n \nIn a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests icatibant was not genotoxic.  \n \nIcatibant was not teratogenic when administered by SC injection during early embryonic and fetal \ndevelopment in rat (top dose 25 mg/kg/day) and rabbit (top dose 10 mg/kg/day). Icatibant is a potent \nantagonist of bradykinin and therefore, at high dose levels, treatment can have effects on the uterine \nimplantation process and subsequent uterine stability in early pregnancy. These uterine effects also \nmanifest in late stage pregnancy where icatibant exhibits a tocolytic effect resulting in delayed \nparturition in the rat, with increased fetal distress and perinatal death at high doses (10 mg/kg/day). \n \nA 2-week subcutaneous dose range finding study in juvenile rats identified 25 mg/kg/day as a \nmaximally tolerated dose. In the pivotal juvenile toxicity study in which sexually immature rats were \ntreated daily with 3 mg/kg/day for 7 weeks, atrophy of testes and epididymides were observed; the \nobserved microscopic findings were partially reversible. Similar effects of icatibant on reproductive \ntissue were seen in sexually mature rats and dogs. These tissue findings were consistent with reported \neffects on gonadotrophins and during the subsequent treatment-free period appear to be reversible.  \n \nIcatibant did not elicit any cardiac conduction change in vitro (hERG channel) or in vivo in normal \ndogs or in various dog models (ventricular pacing, physical exertion and coronary ligation) where no \nassociated hemodynamic changes were observed. Icatibant has been shown to aggravate induced \ncardiac ischemia in several non-clinical models, although a detrimental effect has not consistently \nbeen shown in acute ischemia.  \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you use Firazyr  \n3. How to use Firazyr \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Firazyr \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Firazyr is and what it is used for \n \nFirazyr contains the active substance icatibant. \n \nFirazyr is used for treating the symptoms of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults, adolescents and \nchildren aged 2 years and older. \nIn HAE levels of a substance in your bloodstream called bradykinin are increased and this leads to \nsymptoms like swelling, pain, nausea, and diarrhoea. \nFirazyr blocks the activity of bradykinin and therefore ends the further progression of the symptoms.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Firazyr  \n \nDo not use Firazyr  \n \n- If you are allergic to icatibant, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Firazyr: \n- if you are suffering from angina (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle)  \n- if you have recently suffered a stroke \n\n \nSome of the side effects connected with Firazyr are similar to the symptoms of your disease. Tell your \ndoctor immediately if you notice that your symptoms of the attack get worse after you received Firazyr \n\n \nIn addition: \n- You or your caregiver must be trained on subcutaneous (under the skin) injection technique \n\nbefore you self-inject or your caregiver injects you with Firazyr. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n- Immediately after you self-inject Firazyr or your caregiver injects you with Firazyr while you \n\nare experiencing a laryngeal attack (obstruction of the upper airway), you must seek medical \ncare in a medical institution. \n\n \n- If your symptoms are not resolved following one self- or caregiver administered injection of \n\nFirazyr, you should seek medical advice regarding additional injections of Firazyr. For adult \npatients, up to 2 additional injections may be given within 24 hours. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents  \n \nFirazyr is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age or weighing less than 12 kg \nbecause it has not been studied in these patients.  \n \nOther medicines and Firazyr \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nFirazyr is not known to interact with other medicines. If you are taking a medicine known as an \nAngiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (for example: captopril, enalapril, ramipril, \nquinapril, lisinopril) which is used to lower your blood pressure or for any other reason, you should \ninform your doctor before receiving Firazyr. \n \nPregnancy and breast feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor before starting to use Firazyr. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding you should not breast-feed for 12 hours after you have last received Firazyr. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nDo not drive or use machines if you feel tired or dizzy as a result of your HAE attack or after using \nFirazyr. \n \nFirazyr contains a small amount of sodium \n \nThe injection solution contains less than 1 mmol (23 milligrams) of sodium, so it is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use Firazyr \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure.  \n \nIf you have never received Firazyr previously, your first dose of Firazyr will always be injected by \nyour doctor or nurse. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe for you to go home. After discussion \nwith your doctor or nurse and after training in subcutaneous (under the skin) injection technique, you \nmay be able to inject yourself with Firazyr or your caregiver may inject Firazyr for you when you have \nan HAE attack.  It is important that Firazyr is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you \nnotice an attack of angioedema. Your healthcare provider will teach you and your caregiver how to \nsafely inject Firazyr by following the instructions in the Package Leaflet.   \n \nWhen and how often should you use Firazyr? \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dose of Firazyr and will tell you how often it should be used. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nAdults \n- The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection (3 ml, 30 mg) injected subcutaneously (under \n\nthe skin) as soon as you notice the attack of angioedema (for example increased skin swelling, \nparticularly affecting the face and neck, or increasing tummy pain). \n \n\n- If you experience no relief of symptoms after 6 hours, you should seek medical advice regarding \nadditional injections of Firazyr. For adults, up to 2 additional injections may be given within 24 \nhours. \n\n \n- You should not have more than 3 injections in a 24 hour period and if you require more than \n\n8 injections in a month, you should seek medical advice. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years \n- The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection of 1 ml up to a maximum of 3 ml based on \n\nbody weight injected subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you develop symptoms of an \nangioedema attack (for example increased skin swelling, particularly affecting the face and neck, \nincreasing tummy pain).   \n\n \n- See section on instructions for use for the dose to inject. \n \n- If you are not sure which dose to inject, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n- If your symptoms get worse or do not improve, you must seek immediate medical help. \n \nHow should Firazyr be administered? \n \nFirazyr is intended for subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  Each syringe should only be used \nonce. \n \nFirazyr is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue under the skin in the abdomen (tummy).  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nThe following step-by step instructions are intended for: \n\n- self-administration (adults)  \n- administration by a caregiver or healthcare professional to adults, adolescents or children \n\naged over 2 years (weighing at least 12 kg). \n \nThe instructions include the following main steps: \n \n1)  General Information \n2a)  Preparing the syringe for children and adolescents (2-17 years) weighing 65 kg or less \n2b)  Preparing the syringe and needle for injection (all patients) \n3)  Preparing the injection site \n4)  Injecting the solution \n5)  Disposal of the injection material \n \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nStep-by-Step Instructions for Injection \n \n\n1) General Information \n \n\nâ€¢ Clean the work area (surface) to be used before beginning the process. \n \n\nâ€¢ Wash your hands with soap and water. \n \n\nâ€¢ Open the tray by peeling back the seal. \n \n\nâ€¢ Remove the pre-filled syringe from the tray. \n \n\nâ€¢ Remove the cap from the end of the pre-filled syringe by unscrewing the cap. \n \n\nâ€¢ Put down the pre-filled syringe after unscrewing the cap. \n2a) Preparing the syringe for  \n\nchildren and adolescents (2-17 years) \nweighing 65 kg or less: \n\n \nImportant information for healthcare professionals and caregivers: \n\n \nWhere the dose is less than 30 mg (3 ml), the following equipment is required to extract the \nappropriate dose (see below): \n \n\na) Firazyr pre-filled syringe (containing icatibant solution) \n \n\nb) Connector (adapter) \n \n\nc) 3 ml graduated syringe \n \n\n \n\n \n \nThe required injection volume in ml should be drawn up in an empty 3 ml graduated syringe (see table \nbelow). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nTable 1: Dosage regimen for children and adolescents \n \n\nBody Weight Injection Volume \n\n12 kg to 25 kg 1.0 ml \n\n26 kg to 40 kg 1.5 ml \n\n41 kg to 50 kg 2.0 ml \n\n51 kg to 65 kg 2.5 ml \n\n \nPatients weighing more than 65 kg will use the full contents of the pre-filled syringe (3 ml). \n \n \n\nIf you are not sure which volume of solution to extract, ask your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse \n \n \n1) Remove the caps on each end of the connector. \n \n \n\nAvoid touching the ends of the connector and syringe tips, to prevent contamination \n \n \n2) Screw the connector onto the pre-filled syringe. \n \n3) Attach the graduated syringe to the other end of the connector ensuring that both connections fit \n\nsecurely. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTransferring the icatibant solution to the graduated syringe: \n \n1) To start transfer of icatibant solution, push the pre-filled syringe plunger (on far left of below \n\nimage). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n2) If the icatibant solution does not begin to transfer to the graduated syringe, pull slightly on the \ngraduated syringe plunger until the icatibant solution starts to flow into the graduated syringe (see \nbelow image). \n\n \n\n \n\n3) Continue to push on the pre-filled syringe plunger until the required injection volume (dose) is \ntransferred to the graduated syringe.  Refer to table 1 for dosage information. \n\n \n \n\nIf there is air in the graduated syringe: \n\nâ€¢ Turn the connected syringes so that the pre-filled syringe is on top (see below image). \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Push the plunger of the graduated syringe so that any air is transferred back into the pre-filled \nsyringe (this step may need to be repeated several times). \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nâ€¢ Withdraw the required volume of icatibant solution. \n \n\n4) Remove the pre-filled syringe and connector from the graduated syringe. \n \n5) Discard the pre-filled syringe and connector into the sharps container. \n \n\n2b) Preparing the syringe and needle for injection: \nAll patients (adults, adolescents and children) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nâ€¢ Remove the needle cap from the blister. \n \nâ€¢ Remove the seal from the needle cap (the needle should be still in the needle cap). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Grip the syringe firmly.
