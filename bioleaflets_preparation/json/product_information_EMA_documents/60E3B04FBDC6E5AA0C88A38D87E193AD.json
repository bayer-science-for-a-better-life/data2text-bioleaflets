NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTolura 20 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 20 mg telmisartan.\n\nExcipients with known effect:\nEach tablet contains 74.9 mg sorbitol (E420) and 28.5 mg lactose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet.\n\n20 mg: white to almost white, round tablets\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nHypertension\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults.\n\nCardiovascular prevention\nReduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with:\n- manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or \n\nperipheral arterial disease) or\n- type 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension:\n\nThe usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily. Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of \n20 mg. In cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be \nincreased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily. Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination \nwith thiazide-type diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive \nblood pressure lowering effect with telmisartan. When considering raising the dose, it must be borne \nin mind that the maximum antihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the \nstart of treatment (see section 5.1).\n\nCardiovascular prevention:\n\nThe recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of \ntelmisartan are effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity.\nWhen initiating telmisartan therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity, close monitoring of \nblood pressure is recommended, and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood \npressure may be necessary.\n\n\n\n3\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPatients with renal impairment\n\nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. A lower \nstarting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4). No posology adjustment is \nrequired for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nTolura is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed 40 mg once \ndaily (see section 4.4).\n\nElderly patients\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tolura in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished.\nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTelmisartan tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or \nwithout food.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\n\nTelmisartan should be kept in the sealed blister due to the hygroscopic property of the tablets. Tablets \nshould be taken out of the blister shortly before administration (see section 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n- Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)\n- Biliary obstructive disorders\n- Severe hepatic impairment\n\nThe concomitant use of Tolura with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPregnancy\n\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and \n4.6).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\n\n\n4\n\nTolura is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These patients can be \nexpected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. Tolura should be used only with caution in \npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nRenovascular hypertension\n\nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation\n\nWhen Tolura is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium and \ncreatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Tolura\nin patients with recent kidney transplantation.\n\nIntravascular hypovolaemia\n\nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Tolura, may occur in patients who are \nvolume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Tolura. Volume and/or \nsodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Tolura.\n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\n\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin \nII receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy.\n\nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\n\nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal \ndisease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such \nas telmisartan has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute \nrenal failure (see section 4.8).\n\nPrimary aldosteronism\n\nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended.\n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics\n\nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \n\n\n\n5\n\napproptiate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or \nantidiabetics may be required, when indicated.\n\nHyperkalaemia\n\nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia.\n\nIn the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly \ntreated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/or in patients with \nintercurrent events, hyperkalaemia may be fatal.\n\nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.\n\nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:\n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years).\n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of \nmedicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal \nanti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.\n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic \nacidosis, worsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious \ndiseases), cellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma).\n\nClose monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nSorbitol\n\nTolura tablets contain sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nshould not take Tolura.\n\nLactose\n\nTolura tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take Tolura.\n\nEthnic differences\n\nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in \nnon-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive \npopulation.\n\nOther\n\nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nDigoxin\n\nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \n\n\n\n6\n\ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange.\n\nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, telmisartan may \nprovoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with \nother medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-\ninflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).\n\nThe occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of \nthe above-mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is particularly high in combination with \npotassium sparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium. A \ncombination with ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that \nprecautions for use are strictly followed.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements\n\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.\n\nLithium\n\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, \ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products\n\nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents \nthat inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible \nacute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should be administered \nwith caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration \nshould be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically \nthereafter.\n\nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.\n\nDiuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics)\n\nPrior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide \n(thiazide diuretic) may result in volume depletion and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy \nwith telmisartan.\n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use\n\n\n\n7\n\nOther antihypertensive agents\n\nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products.\n\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, \namifostine. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics \nor antidepressants.\n\nCorticosteroids (systemic route)\n\nReduction of the antihypertensive effect.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Tolura in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\n\nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3).\nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.\nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Tolura during breast-feeding, Tolura is not \nrecommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding \nare preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.\n\nFertility\n\n\n\n8\n\nIn preclinical studies, no effects of Tolura on male and female fertility were observed.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nWhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or \ndrowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy such as Tolura.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nSerious adverse drug reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which may occur rarely \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), and acute renal failure.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan was usually comparable to \nplacebo (41.4 % vs 43.9 %) in controlled trials in patients treated for hypertension. The incidence of \nadverse reactions was not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the \npatients. The safety profile of telmisartan in patients treated for the reduction of cardiovascular \nmorbidity was consistent with that obtained in hypertensive patients.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed below have been accumulated from controlled clinical trials in patients \ntreated for hypertension and from post-marketing reports. The listing also takes into account serious \nadverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported in three clinical long-term \nstudies including 21642 patients treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity \nfor up to six years.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100);\nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nInfections and infestations \n\nUncommon:\n\nRare: \n\nUrinary tract infection including cystitis, upper respiratory tract infection \nincluding pharyngitis and sinusitis\nSepsis including fatal outcome1\n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nAnaemia\nEosinophilia, thrombocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders \nRare: Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nHyperkalaemia\nHypoglycaemia (in diabetic patients)\n\nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nInsomnia, depression\nAnxiety\n\nNervous system disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nSyncope\nSomnolence\n\n\n\n9\n\nEye disorders \nRare: Visual disturbance\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nBradycardia\nTachycardia \n\nVascular disorders \n\nUncommon: Hypotension2, orthostatic hypotension\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon:\nVery rare:\n\nDyspnoea, cough\nInterstitial lung disease4\n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nAbdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting\nDry mouth, stomach discomfort, dysgeusia\n\nHepato-biliary disorders \nRare: Hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder3\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nPruritus, hyperhidrosis, rash\nAngioedema (also with fatal outcome), eczema, erythema, urticaria, drug \neruption, toxic skin eruption\n\nMuscoloskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nBack pain (e.g. sciatica), muscle spasms, myalgia,\nArthralgia, pain in extremity, tendon pain (tendinitis like symptoms)\n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: Renal impairment including acute renal failure \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon: \nRare:\n\nChest pain, asthenia (weakness)\nInfluenza-like illness\n\nInvestigations \n\nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nBlood creatinine increased\nHaemoglobin decreased, blood uric acid increased, hepatic enzyme \nincreased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased \n\n1, 2, 3, 4: for further descriptions, please see sub-section “Description of selected adverse reactions”\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nSepsis\nIn the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with \nplacebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see also \nsection 5.1).\n\nHypotension\n\n\n\n10\n\nThis adverse reaction was reported as common in patients with controlled blood pressure who were \ntreated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity on top of standard care.\n\nHepatic function abnormal/liver disorder\nMost cases of hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder from post-marketing experience occurred in \nJapanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse reactions.\n\nInterstitial lung disease\nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal \nassociation with the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans.\n\nSymptoms: The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and \ntachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also \nbeen reported.\n\nTreatment: Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, \nand the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since \ningestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or \ngastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Serum electrolytes \nand creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a \nsupine position, with salt and volume replacement given quickly.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC code: C09CA07.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which \nis responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist \nactivity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-\nlasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less \ncharacterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of \ntheir possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma \naldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or \nblock ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the \nenzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-\nmediated adverse effects.\n\nIn human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to \n48 hours.\n\n\n\n11\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension\nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by \ntrough to peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in \nplacebo controlled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to \nrecovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood \npressure (DBP) are inconsistent.\n\nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable \nto that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated \nin clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and \nlisinopril).\n\nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.\n\nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments.\n\nCardiovascular prevention\nONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) \ncompared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on \ncardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery \ndisease, stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence\nof end-organ damage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), \nwhich is a population at risk for cardiovascular events.\n\nPatients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n = \n8542), ramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n = \n8502), and followed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years.\n\nTelmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for \ncongestive heart failure. The incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 %) \nand ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 -\n1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a margin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6 % and \n11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated patients, respectively.\n\nTelmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 -\n1.08), p (non-inferiority) = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart \nOutcomes Prevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.\n\nTRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as \nONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. \nThe mean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the \nincidence of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, \nnon-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the telmisartan \n\n\n\n12\n\nand 17.0 % in the placebo groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)]. There \nwas evidence for a benefit of telmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary \ncomposite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke \n[0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no evidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality \n(hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24).\n\nCough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in \npatients treated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan.\n\nCombining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV \nmortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was \na significantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the\ncombination arm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended \nin this population.\n\nIn the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 \nyears and older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for \ntelmisartan compared with placebo, 0,70 % vs. 0,49 % RR 1,43 (95 % confidence interval 1,00 –\n2,06) the incidence of fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0,33 %) vs. \npatients taking placebo (0,16 %) RR 2,07 (95 % confidence interval 1,14 – 3,76). The observed \nincreased occurrence rate of sepsis associated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance \nfinding or related to a mechanism not currently known.\n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker.\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D \nwas a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy.\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of telmisartan in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished.\n\nThe blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in 76 hypertensive, \nlargely overweight patients aged 6 to < 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), \nafter taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 29 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week \ntreatment period. By inclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some \nof the investigated patients the doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of \nhypertension in the adult population, reaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in \nadults. After adjustment for age group effects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) \n\n\n\n13\n\nwere -14.5 (1.7) mmHg in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg group, -9.7 (1.7) mmHg in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg \ngroup, and -6.0 (2.4) in the placebo group. The adjusted DBP changes from baseline were -8.4 (1.5) \nmmHg, -4.5 (1.6) mmHg and -3.5 (2.1) mmHg respectively. The change was dose dependent. The \nsafety data from this study in patients aged 6 to < 18 years appeared generally similar to that observed \nin adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan in children and adolescents was not \nevaluated.\n\nAn increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its \nclinical significance and relevance is unknown.\n\nThese clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in \nhypertensive paediatric population.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately \n6 % (40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. There is \nno linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase \ndisproportionately at doses above 40 mg.\n\nDistribution\nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein. The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.\n\nBiotransformation\nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.\n\nElimination\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area \nunder the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no \nevidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma \nconcentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.\n\nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma \nclearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about \n1,500 ml/min).\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in \nhypertensive patients (n = 57) aged 6 to < 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a \nfour-week treatment period. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state \nof telmisartan in children and adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the \nstudy was too small for a meaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years of \nage, the results are generally consistent with the findings in adults and confirm the non-linearity of \ntelmisartan, particularly for Cmax.\n\n\n\n14\n\nGender\nDifferences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and \n2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than \n65 years.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was \nobserved. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency \nundergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and \ncannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal \nimpairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic \nimpairment.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium \nin normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal \ninjury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-\nmediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation.\n\nIn both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal \njuxtaglomerular cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical \nsignificance.\n\nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed.\n\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nHypertension\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults.\n\nCardiovascular prevention\nReduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with:\n- manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or \n\nperipheral arterial disease) or\n- type 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension\n\nThe usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily. Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of \n20 mg. In cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be \nincreased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily. Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination \nwith thiazide-type diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive \nblood pressure lowering effect with telmisartan. When considering raising the dose, it must be borne \nin mind that the maximum antihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the \nstart of treatment (see section 5.1).\n\nCardiovascular prevention\n\nThe recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of \ntelmisartan are effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity.\nWhen initiating telmisartan therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity, close monitoring of \nblood pressure is recommended, and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood \npressure may be necessary.\n\n\n\n17\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPatients with renal impairment\n\nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. A lower \nstarting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4). No posology adjustment is \nrequired for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nTolura is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed 40 mg once \ndaily (see section 4.4).\n\nElderly patients\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tolura in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished.\nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTelmisartan tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or \nwithout food.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\n\nTelmisartan should be kept in the sealed blister due to the hygroscopic property of the tablets. Tablets \nshould be taken out of the blister shortly before administration (see section 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n- Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)\n- Biliary obstructive disorders\n- Severe hepatic impairment\n\nThe concomitant use of Tolura with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPregnancy\n\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and \n4.6).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\n\n\n18\n\nTolura is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These patients can be \nexpected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. Tolura should be used only with caution in \npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nRenovascular hypertension\n\nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation\n\nWhen Tolura is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium and \ncreatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Tolura\nin patients with recent kidney transplantation.\n\nIntravascular hypovolaemia\n\nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Tolura, may occur in patients who are \nvolume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Tolura. Volume and/or \nsodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Tolura.\n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\n\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin \nII receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy.\n\nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\n\nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal \ndisease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such \nas telmisartan has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute \nrenal failure (see section 4.8).\n\nPrimary aldosteronism\n\nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended.\n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics\n\nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \n\n\n\n19\n\napproptiate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or \nantidiabetics may be required, when indicated.\n\nHyperkalaemia\n\nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia.\n\nIn the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly \ntreated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/or in patients with \nintercurrent events, hyperkalaemia may be fatal.\n\nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.\n\nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:\n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years).\n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of \nmedicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal \nanti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.\n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic \nacidosis, worsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious \ndiseases), cellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma).\n\nClose monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nSorbitol\n\nTolura tablets contain sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nshould not take Tolura.\n\nLactose\n\nTolura tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take Tolura.\n\nEthnic differences\n\nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in \nnon-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive \npopulation.\n\nOther\n\nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nDigoxin\n\nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \n\n\n\n20\n\ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange.\n\nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, telmisartan may \nprovoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with \nother medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-\ninflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).\n\nThe occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of \nthe above-mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is particularly high in combination with \npotassium sparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium. A \ncombination with ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that \nprecautions for use are strictly followed.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements\n\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.\n\nLithium\n\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, \ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products\n\nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents \nthat inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible \nacute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should be administered \nwith caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration \nshould be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically \nthereafter.\n\nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.\n\nDiuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics)\n\nPrior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide \n(thiazide diuretic) may result in volume depletion and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy \nwith telmisartan.\n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use\n\n\n\n21\n\nOther antihypertensive agents\n\nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products.\n\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, \namifostine. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics \nor antidepressants.\n\nCorticosteroids (systemic route)\n\nReduction of the antihypertensive effect.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Tolura in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\n\nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3).\nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.\nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Tolura during breast-feeding, Tolura is not \nrecommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding \nare preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.\n\nFertility\n\n\n\n22\n\nIn preclinical studies, no effects of Tolura on male and female fertility were observed.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nWhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or \ndrowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy such as Tolura.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nSerious adverse drug reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which may occur rarely \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), and acute renal failure.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan was usually comparable to \nplacebo (41.4 % vs 43.9 %) in controlled trials in patients treated for hypertension. The incidence of \nadverse reactions was not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the \npatients. The safety profile of telmisartan in patients treated for the reduction of cardiovascular \nmorbidity was consistent with that obtained in hypertensive patients.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed below have been accumulated from controlled clinical trials in patients \ntreated for hypertension and from post-marketing reports. The listing also takes into account serious \nadverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported in three clinical long-term \nstudies including 21642 patients treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity \nfor up to six years.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100);\nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nInfections and infestations \n\n Uncommon:\n\nRare:\n\nUrinary tract infection including cystitis, upper respiratory tract infection \nincluding pharyngitis and sinusitis\nSepsis including fatal outcome1\n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nAnaemia\nEosinophilia, thrombocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders \nRare: Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nHyperkalaemia\nHypoglycaemia (in diabetic patients)\n\nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: \nRare: \n\nInsomnia, depression\nAnxiety \n\nNervous system disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nSyncope\nSomnolence\n\n\n\n23\n\nEye disorders \nRare: Visual disturbance\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nBradycardia\nTachycardia\n\nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Hypotension2, orthostatic hypotension\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon:\nVery rare:\n\nDyspnoea, cough\nInterstitial lung disease4\n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nAbdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting\nDry mouth, stomach discomfort, dysgeusia\n\nHepato-biliary disorders \nRare: Hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder3\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nPruritus, hyperhidrosis, rash\nAngioedema (also with fatal outcome), eczema, erythema, urticaria, drug \neruption, toxic skin eruption\n\nMuscoloskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nBack pain (e.g. sciatica), muscle spasms, myalgia,\nArthralgia, pain in extremity, tendon pain (tendinitis like symptoms)\n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: Renal impairment including acute renal failure \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon: \nRare:\n\nChest pain, asthenia (weakness)\nInfluenza-like illness\n\nInvestigations \n\nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nBlood creatinine increased\nHaemoglobin decreased, blood uric acid increased, hepatic enzyme increased, \nblood creatine phosphokinase increased\n\n1, 2, 3, 4: for further descriptions, please see sub-section “Description of selected adverse reactions”\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nSepsis\nIn the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with \nplacebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see also \nsection 5.1).\n\n\n\n24\n\nHypotension\nThis adverse reaction was reported as common in patients with controlled blood pressure who were \ntreated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity on top of standard care.\n\nHepatic function abnormal/liver disorder\nMost cases of hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder from post-marketing experience occurred in \nJapanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse reactions.\n\nInterstitial lung disease\nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal \nassociation with the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans.\n\nSymptoms: The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and \ntachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also \nbeen reported.\n\nTreatment: Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, \nand the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since \ningestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or \ngastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Serum electrolytes \nand creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a \nsupine position, with salt and volume replacement given quickly.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC code: C09CA07.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which \nis responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist \nactivity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-\nlasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less \ncharacterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of \ntheir possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma \naldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or \nblock ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the \nenzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-\nmediated adverse effects.\n\nIn human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to \n48 hours.\n\n\n\n25\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension\nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by \ntrough to peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in \nplacebo controlled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to \nrecovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood \npressure (DBP) are inconsistent.\n\nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable \nto that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated \nin clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and \nlisinopril).\n\nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.\n\nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments.\n\nCardiovascular prevention\nONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint \nTrial) compared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on \ncardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery \ndisease, stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence\nof end-organ damage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), \nwhich is a population at risk for cardiovascular events.\n\nPatients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n = \n8542), ramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n = \n8502), and followed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years.\n\nTelmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for \ncongestive heart failure. The incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 %) \nand ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 -\n1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a margin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6 % and \n11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated patients, respectively.\n\nTelmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 -\n1.08), p (non-inferiority) = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart \nOutcomes Prevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.\n\nTRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as \nONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. \nThe mean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the \nincidence of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, \n\n\n\n26\n\nnon-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the telmisartan \nand 17.0 % in the placebo groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)]. There \nwas evidence for a benefit of telmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary \ncomposite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke \n[0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no evidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality \n(hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24).\n\nCough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in \npatients treated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan.\n\nCombining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV \nmortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was \na significantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the\ncombination arm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended \nin this population.\n\nIn the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 \nyears and older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for \ntelmisartan compared with placebo, 0,70 % vs. 0,49 % RR 1,43 (95 % confidence interval 1,00 –\n2,06) the incidence of fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0,33 %) vs. \npatients taking placebo (0,16 %) RR 2,07 (95 % confidence interval 1,14 – 3,76). The observed \nincreased occurrence rate of sepsis associated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance \nfinding or related to a mechanism not currently known.\n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker.\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D \nwas a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy.\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of telmisartan in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished.\n\nThe blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in 76 hypertensive, \nlargely overweight patients aged 6 to < 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), \nafter taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 29 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week \ntreatment period. By inclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some \nof the investigated patients the doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of \nhypertension in the adult population, reaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in \n\n\n\n27\n\nadults. After adjustment for age group effects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) \nwere -14.5 (1.7) mmHg in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg group, -9.7 (1.7) mmHg in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg \ngroup, and -6.0 (2.4) in the placebo group. The adjusted DBP changes from baseline were -8.4 (1.5) \nmmHg, -4.5 (1.6) mmHg and -3.5 (2.1) mmHg respectively. The change was dose dependent. The \nsafety data from this study in patients aged 6 to < 18 years appeared generally similar to that observed \nin adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan in children and adolescents was not \nevaluated.\n\nAn increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its \nclinical significance and relevance is unknown.\n\nThese clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in \nhypertensive paediatric population.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately \n6 % (40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. There is \nno linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase \ndisproportionately at doses above 40 mg.\n\nDistribution\nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein. The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.\n\nBiotransformation\nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.\n\nElimination\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area \nunder the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no \nevidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma \nconcentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.\n\nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma \nclearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about \n1,500 ml/min).\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in \nhypertensive patients (n = 57) aged 6 to < 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a \nfour-week treatment period. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state \nof telmisartan in children and adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the \nstudy was too small for a meaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years of \nage, the results are generally consistent with the findings in adults and confirm the non-linearity of \n\n\n\n28\n\ntelmisartan, particularly for Cmax.\n\nGender\nDifferences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and \n2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than \n65 years.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was \nobserved. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency \nundergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and \ncannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal \nimpairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic \nimpairment.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium \nin normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal \ninjury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-\nmediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation.\n\nIn both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal \njuxtaglomerular cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical \nsignificance.\n\nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed.\n\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nHypertension\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults.\n\nCardiovascular prevention\nReduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with:\n- manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or \n\nperipheral arterial disease) or\n- type 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension\n\nThe usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily. Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of \n20 mg. In cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be \nincreased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily. Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination \nwith thiazide-type diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive \nblood pressure lowering effect with telmisartan. When considering raising the dose, it must be borne \nin mind that the maximum antihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the \nstart of treatment (see section 5.1).\n\nCardiovascular prevention\n\nThe recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of \ntelmisartan are effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity.\nWhen initiating telmisartan therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity, close monitoring of \nblood pressure is recommended, and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood \npressure may be necessary.\n\n\n\n31\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPatients with renal impairment\n\nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. A lower \nstarting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4). No posology adjustment is \nrequired for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nTolura is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed 40 mg once \ndaily (see section 4.4).\n\nElderly patients\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tolura in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished.\nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTelmisartan tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or \nwithout food.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\n\nTelmisartan should be kept in the sealed blister due to the hygroscopic property of the tablets. Tablets \nshould be taken out of the blister shortly before administration (see section 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n- Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)\n- Biliary obstructive disorders\n- Severe hepatic impairment\n\nThe concomitant use of Tolura with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPregnancy\n\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and \n4.6).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\n\n\n32\n\nTolura is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These patients can be \nexpected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. Tolura should be used only with caution in \npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nRenovascular hypertension\n\nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation\n\nWhen Tolura is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium and \ncreatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Tolura\nin patients with recent kidney transplantation.\n\nIntravascular hypovolaemia\n\nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Tolura, may occur in patients who are \nvolume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Tolura. Volume and/or \nsodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Tolura.\n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\n\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin \nII receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy.\n\nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\n\nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal \ndisease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such \nas telmisartan has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute \nrenal failure (see section 4.8).\n\nPrimary aldosteronism\n\nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended.\n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics\n\nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \n\n\n\n33\n\napproptiate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or \nantidiabetics may be required, when indicated.\n\nHyperkalaemia\n\nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia.\n\nIn the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly \ntreated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/or in patients with \nintercurrent events, hyperkalaemia may be fatal.\n\nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.\n\nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:\n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years).\n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of \nmedicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal \nanti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.\n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic \nacidosis, worsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious \ndiseases), cellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma).\n\nClose monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nSorbitol\n\nTolura tablets contain sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nshould not take Tolura.\n\nLactose\n\nTolura tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take Tolura.\n\nEthnic differences\n\nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in \nnon-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive \npopulation.\n\nOther\n\nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nDigoxin\n\nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \n\n\n\n34\n\ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange.\n\nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, telmisartan may \nprovoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with \nother medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-\ninflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).\n\nThe occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of \nthe above-mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is particularly high in combination with \npotassium sparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium. A \ncombination with ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that \nprecautions for use are strictly followed.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements\n\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.\n\nLithium\n\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, \ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products\n\nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents \nthat inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible \nacute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should be administered \nwith caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration \nshould be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically \nthereafter.\n\nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.\n\nDiuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics)\n\nPrior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide \n(thiazide diuretic) may result in volume depletion and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy \nwith telmisartan.\n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use\n\n\n\n35\n\nOther antihypertensive agents\n\nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products.\n\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, \namifostine. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics \nor antidepressants.\n\nCorticosteroids (systemic route)\n\nReduction of the antihypertensive effect.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Tolura in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\n\nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3).\nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.\nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Tolura during breast-feeding, Tolura is not \nrecommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding \nare preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.\n\nFertility\n\n\n\n36\n\nIn preclinical studies, no effects of Tolura on male and female fertility were observed.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nWhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or \ndrowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy such as Tolura.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nSerious adverse drug reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which may occur rarely \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), and acute renal failure.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan was usually comparable to \nplacebo (41.4 % vs 43.9 %) in controlled trials in patients treated for hypertension. The incidence of \nadverse reactions was not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the \npatients. The safety profile of telmisartan in patients treated for the reduction of cardiovascular \nmorbidity was consistent with that obtained in hypertensive patients.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed below have been accumulated from controlled clinical trials in patients \ntreated for hypertension and from post-marketing reports. The listing also takes into account serious \nadverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported in three clinical long-term \nstudies including 21642 patients treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity \nfor up to six years.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100);\nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nInfections and infestations\n\nUncommon:\n\nRare: \n\nUrinary tract infection including cystitis, upper respiratory tract infection \nincluding pharyngitis and sinusitis\nSepsis including fatal outcome1\n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nAnaemia\nEosinophilia, thrombocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders \nRare: Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon:\nRare\n\nHyperkalaemia\nHypoglycaemia (in diabetic patients)\n\nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: \nRare: \n\nInsomnia, depression\nAnxiety \n\nNervous system disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nSyncope\nSomnolence\n\n\n\n37\n\nEye disorders \nRare: Visual disturbance\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nBradycardia\nTachycardia\n\nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Hypotension2, orthostatic hypotension\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon:\nVery rare:\n\nDyspnoea, cough\nInterstitial lung disease4\n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon:\nRare: \n\nAbdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting\nDry mouth, stomach discomfort, dysgeusia\n\nHepato-biliary disorders \nRare: Hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder3\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nPruritus, hyperhidrosis, rash\nAngioedema (also with fatal outcome), eczema, erythema, urticaria, drug \neruption, toxic skin eruption\n\nMuscoloskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nBack pain (e.g. sciatica), muscle spasms, myalgia\nArthralgia, pain in extremity, tendon pain (tendinitis like symptoms)\n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: Renal impairment including acute renal failure \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon: \nRare:\n\nChest pain, asthenia (weakness)\nInfluenza-like illness\n\nInvestigations \n\nUncommon:\nRare:\n\nBlood creatinine increased\nHaemoglobin decreased, blood uric acid increased, hepatic enzyme increased, \nblood creatine phosphokinase increased\n\n1, 2, 3, 4: for further descriptions, please see sub-section “Description of selected adverse reactions”\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nSepsis\nIn the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with \nplacebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see also \nsection 5.1).\n\nHypotension\n\n\n\n38\n\nThis adverse reaction was reported as common in patients with controlled blood pressure who were \ntreated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity on top of standard care.\n\nHepatic function abnormal/liver disorder\nMost cases of hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder from post-marketing experience occurred in \npatients in Japan, who are more likely to experience these adverse reactions.\n\nInterstitial lung disease\nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal \nassociation with the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans.\n\nSymptoms: The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and \ntachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also \nbeen reported.\n\nTreatment: Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, \nand the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since \ningestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or \ngastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Serum electrolytes \nand creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a \nsupine position, with salt and volume replacement given quickly.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC code: C09CA07.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which \nis responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist \nactivity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-\nlasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less \ncharacterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of \ntheir possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma \naldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or \nblock ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the \nenzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-\nmediated adverse effects.\n\nIn human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to \n48 hours.\n\n\n\n39\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension\nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by \ntrough to peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in \nplacebo controlled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to \nrecovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood \npressure (DBP) are inconsistent.\n\nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable \nto that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated \nin clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and \nlisinopril).\n\nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.\n\nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments.\n\nCardiovascular prevention\nONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint \nTrial) compared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on \ncardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery \ndisease, stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence \nof end-organ damage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), \nwhich is a population at risk for cardiovascular events.\n\nPatients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n = \n8542), ramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n = \n8502), and followed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years.\n\nTelmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for \ncongestive heart failure. The incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 \n%)and ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI \n0.93 - 1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a margin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6 % \nand 11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated patients, respectively.\n\nTelmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 -\n1.08), p (non-inferiority) = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart \nOutcomes Prevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.\n\nTRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as \nONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care.\nThe mean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the \nincidence of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, \nnon-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the telmisartan \n\n\n\n40\n\nand 17.0 % in the placebo groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)]. There \nwas evidence for a benefit of telmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary \ncomposite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke \n[0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no evidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality \n(hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24).\n\nCough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in \npatients treated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan.\n\nCombining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV \nmortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was \na significantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the \ncombination arm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended \nin this population.\n\nIn the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 \nyears and older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for \ntelmisartan compared with placebo, 0,70 % vs. 0,49 % RR 1,43 (95 % confidence interval 1,00 –\n2,06) the incidence of fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0,33 %) vs. \npatients taking placebo (0,16 %) RR 2,07 (95 % confidence interval 1,14 – 3,76). The observed \nincreased occurrence rate of sepsis associated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance \nfinding or related to a mechanism not currently known.\n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker.\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D \nwas a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy.\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of telmisartan in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished.\n\nThe blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in 76 hypertensive, \nlargely overweight patients aged 6 to < 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), \nafter taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 29 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week \ntreatment period. By inclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some \nof the investigated patients the doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of \nhypertension in the adult population, reaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in \nadults. After adjustment for age group effects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) \nwere -14.5 (1.7) mmHg in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg group, -9.7 (1.7) mmHg in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg \n\n\n\n41\n\ngroup, and -6.0 (2.4) in the placebo group. The adjusted DBP changes from baseline were -8.4 (1.5) \nmmHg, -4.5 (1.6) mmHg and -3.5 (2.1) mmHg respectively. The change was dose dependent. The \nsafety data from this study in patients aged 6 to < 18 years appeared generally similar to that observed \nin adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan in children and adolescents was not \nevaluated.\n\nAn increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its \nclinical significance and relevance is unknown.\n\nThese clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in \nhypertensive paediatric population.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately \n6 % (40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. There is \nno linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase \ndisproportionately at doses above 40 mg.\n\nDistribution\nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein. The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.\n\nBiotransformation\nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.\n\nElimination\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area \nunder the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no \nevidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma \nconcentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.\n\nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma \nclearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about \n1,500 ml/min).\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in \nhypertensive patients (n = 57) aged 6 to < 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a \nfour-week treatment period. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state \nof telmisartan in children and adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the \nstudy was too small for a meaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years of \nage, the results are generally consistent with the findings in adults and confirm the non-linearity of \ntelmisartan, particularly for Cmax.\n\n\n\n42\n\nGender\nDifferences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and \n2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than \n65 years.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was \nobserved. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency \nundergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and \ncannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal \nimpairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic \nimpairment.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium \nin normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal \ninjury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-\nmediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation.\n\nIn both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal \njuxtaglomerular cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical \nsignificance.\n\nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed.\n\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n58\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nTolura 20 mg tablets\nTelmisartan\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Tolura is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Tolura\n3. How to take Tolura\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Tolura\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Tolura is and what it is used for\n\nTolura belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II is \na substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus increasing your \nblood pressure. Tolura blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels relax, and your \nblood pressure is lowered.\n\nTolura is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ means that \nthe high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition.\n\nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead \nsometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms \nof high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure \nto verify if it is within the normal range.\n\nTolura is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults who are at \nrisk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke or \nhave high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tolura\n\nDo not take Tolura\n- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Tolura in early pregnancy –\n\nsee pregnancy section.)\n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tolura.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\n\n\n59\n\nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses:\n\n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant.\n- Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).\n- Liver disease.\n- Heart trouble.\n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various \n\nblood minerals).\n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ('water tablets'), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting.\n\n- Elevated potassium levels in your blood.\n- Diabetes.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Tolura:\n- if you are taking digoxin.\n- if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:\n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems,\n\n- aliskiren.\n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Tolura is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).\n\nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Tolura.\n\nTolura may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.\n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals.\nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Tolura”.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe use of Tolura in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.\n\nOther medicines and Tolura\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Tolura:\n\n- Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.\n- Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain 'water tablets'), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or \nibuprofen), heparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic \ntrimethoprim.\n\n- Diuretics ('water tablets'), especially if taken in high doses together with Tolura, may lead to \nexcessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension).\n\n- If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not \ntake Tolura” and “Warnings and precautions”).\n\n- Digoxin.\n\nThe effect of Tolura may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids.\n\n\n\n60\n\nTolura may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). \nFurthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or \nantidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your \ndoctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Tolura.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nPregnancy\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Tolura before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant \nand will advise you to take another medicine instead of Tolura. Tolura is not recommended in early \npregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to \nyour baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Tolura is not recommended \nfor mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish \nto breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Tolura. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\nTolura contains lactose and sorbitol (E420).\nIf you are intolerant to some sugars, consult your doctor before taking Tolura.\n\n3. How to take Tolura\n\nAlways take Tolura exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose of Tolura is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.\nYou can take Tolura with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Tolura every day until your doctor tells you \notherwise. If you have the impression that the effect of Tolura is too strong or too weak, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist.\n\nFor treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Tolura for most patients is one 40 mg tablet \nonce a day to control blood pressure over the 24 hour period. Your doctor has recommended a lower \ndose of one 20 mg tablet daily. Tolura may also be used in combination with diuretics ('water tablets') \nsuch as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering effect \nwith Tolura.\n\nFor reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Tolura is one 80 mg tablet once a day. At the \nbeginning of the preventive therapy with Tolura 80 mg, blood pressure should be frequently \nmonitored.\n\nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.\n\nIf you take more Tolura than you should\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take Tolura\n\n\n\n61\n\nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If \nyou do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for forgotten individual doses.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Tolura\n3. How to take Tolura\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Tolura\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Tolura is and what it is used for\n\nTolura belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II is \na substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus increasing your \nblood pressure. Tolura blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels relax, and your \nblood pressure is lowered.\n\nTolura is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ means that \nthe high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition.\n\nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead \nsometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms \nof high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure \nto verify if it is within the normal range.\n\nTolura is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults who are at \nrisk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke or \nhave high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tolura\n\nDo not take Tolura\n- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Tolura in early pregnancy –\n\nsee pregnancy section.)\n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tolura.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\n\n\n65\n\nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses:\n\n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant.\n- Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).\n- Liver disease.\n- Heart trouble.\n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various \n\nblood minerals).\n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ('water tablets'), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting.\n\n- Elevated potassium levels in your blood.\n- Diabetes.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Tolura:\n- if you are taking digoxin.\n- if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:\n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems,\n\n- aliskiren.\n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Tolura is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).\n\nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Tolura.\n\nTolura may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.\n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals.\nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Tolura”.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe use of Tolura in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.\n\nOther medicines and Tolura\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Tolura:\n\n- Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.\n- Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain 'water tablets'), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or \nibuprofen), heparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic \ntrimethoprim.\n\n- Diuretics ('water tablets'), especially if taken in high doses together with Tolura, may lead to \nexcessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension).\n\n- If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not \ntake Tolura” and “Warnings and precautions”).\n\n- Digoxin.\n\nThe effect of Tolura may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids.\n\n\n\n66\n\nTolura may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). \nFurthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or \nantidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your \ndoctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Tolura.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nPregnancy\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Tolura before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant \nand will advise you to take another medicine instead of Tolura. Tolura is not recommended in early \npregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to \nyour baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Tolura is not recommended \nfor mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish \nto breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Tolura. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\nTolura contains lactose and sorbitol (E420).\nIf you are intolerant to some sugars, consult your doctor before taking Tolura.\n\n3. How to take Tolura\n\nAlways take Tolura exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose of Tolura is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. \nYou can take Tolura with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Tolura every day until your doctor tells you \notherwise. If you have the impression that the effect of Tolura is too strong or too weak, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist.\n\nFor treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Tolura for most patients is one 40 mg tablet \nonce a day to control blood pressure over the 24 hour period. However, sometimes your doctor may \nrecommend a lower dose of 20 mg or a higher dose of 80 mg. Tolura may also be used in combination \nwith diuretics ('water tablets') such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive \nblood pressure lowering effect with Tolura.\n\nFor reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Tolura is one 80 mg tablet once a day. At the \nbeginning of the preventive therapy with Tolura 80 mg, blood pressure should be frequently \nmonitored.\n\nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.\n\nIf you take more Tolura than you should\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take Tolura\n\n\n\n67\n\nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If \nyou do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for forgotten individual doses.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

What Tolura is and what it is used for\n\nTolura belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II is \na substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus increasing your \nblood pressure. Tolura blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels relax, and your \nblood pressure is lowered.\n\nTolura is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ means that \nthe high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition.\n\nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead \nsometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms \nof high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure \nto verify if it is within the normal range.\n\nTolura is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults who are at \nrisk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke or \nhave high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tolura\n\nDo not take Tolura\n- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Tolura in early pregnancy –\n\nsee pregnancy section.)\n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tolura.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\n\n\n71\n\nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses:\n\n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant.\n- Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).\n- Liver disease.\n- Heart trouble.\n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various \n\nblood minerals).\n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ('water tablets'), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting.\n\n- Elevated potassium levels in your blood.\n- Diabetes.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Tolura:\n- if you are taking digoxin.\n- if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:\n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems,\n\n- aliskiren.\n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Tolura is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).\n\nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Tolura.\n\nTolura may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.\n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals.\nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Tolura”.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe use of Tolura in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.\n\nOther medicines and Tolura\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Tolura:\n\n- Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.\n- Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain 'water tablets'), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or \nibuprofen), heparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic \ntrimethoprim.\n\n- Diuretics ('water tablets'), especially if taken in high doses together with Tolura, may lead to \nexcessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension).\n\n- If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not \ntake Tolura” and “Warnings and precautions”).\n\n- Digoxin.\n\nThe effect of Tolura may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids.\n\n\n\n72\n\nTolura may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). \nFurthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or \nantidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your \ndoctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Tolura.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nPregnancy\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Tolura before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant \nand will advise you to take another medicine instead of Tolura. Tolura is not recommended in early \npregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to \nyour baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Tolura is not recommended \nfor mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish \nto breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Tolura. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\nTolura contains lactose and sorbitol (E420).\nIf you are intolerant to some sugars, consult your doctor before taking Tolura.\n\n3. How to take Tolura\n\nAlways take Tolura exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose of Tolura is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. \nYou can take Tolura with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Tolura every day until your doctor tells you \notherwise. If you have the impression that the effect of Tolura is too strong or too weak, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist.\n\nFor treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Tolura for most patients is one 40 mg tablet \nonce a day to control blood pressure over the 24 hour period. However, sometimes your doctor may \nrecommend a lower dose of 20 mg or a higher dose of 80 mg. Tolura may also be used in combination \nwith diuretics ('water tablets') such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive \nblood pressure lowering effect with Tolura.\n\nFor reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Tolura is one 80 mg tablet once a day. At the \nbeginning of the preventive therapy with Tolura 80 mg, blood pressure should be frequently \nmonitored.\n\nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.\n\nIf you take more Tolura than you should\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take Tolura\n\n\n\n73\n\nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If \nyou do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for forgotten individual doses.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.
